Should I pursue my own startup idea, or should I accept a job offer to become CXO at AustrianStartups’? I was torn. With AustrianStartups I could improve the Austrian ecosystem by helping others to fulfill their entrepreneurial ambitions. However, I was also very passionate about my sustainable venture rePhil, a new system for reusable takeaway packaging. I questioned whether I could inspire others to pursue their innovative ideas if I don’t lead by example and start my own business. After a month of weighing the options, I decided to pursue both. I joined AustrianStartups as CXO on a part-time basis while simultaneously working on launching rePhil. We were concerned that neither of these roles could be handled with only a part time commitment and that the decision might send mixed signals. But I saw synergies in the combination. I was fortunate that Markus and the board of AustrianStartups gave me the flexibility to join as part-time CXO and that my team at rePhil supported my decision. Ultimately, the setup seemed perfect – I felt I was fulfilling in my role at AustrianStartups by applying my learnings from rePhil to improve the startup ecosystem in Austria. I could also use the knowledge and network I gained with AustrianStartups to grow rePhil. Though I worked long hours, the combination worked out well for the first six months. RePhil was making fast progress: We gained a new team member Alex, launched with our pilot customer the cafeteria at A1 telecom, and joined multiple acceleration programs. At AustrianStartups we set a new focus on sustainability by launching circle17, got 19 of the AS Agenda points into the turquoise-green government program and created a strategy for a new project: the Entrepreneurial Leadership Program, fostering the most promising future entrepreneurial leaders in Austria. Then, the global pandemic took us by surprise. At first, the lockdown seemed to improve our work. At rePhil, we were faster than expected with developing the app, and we climbed an extremely steep learning curve. We dove deep into user journeys, UI and UX design and what it needs to develop an app. At AustrianStartups we mobilized the community by launching Hack the Crisis, set up a survey to track the immediate effect of the pandemic on startups in Austria, and virtualized all events and programs, including our newly-launched Entrepreneurial Leadership Program. However, the crisis also showed the weak points in my two-folded strategy. It was a tough journey. Some days I got up and felt like there was a huge weight on top of me and every time I got one burden off my shoulders two new ones appeared. Nevertheless, I learned to understand how to use my strengths, weaknesses, and passions. Here are my key insights from this intense period in the hope you can benefit from my experience. #1 Founding a startup is not a part-time job Being in home office made it increasingly difficult to separate my professions. This made apparent how hard it is to build a startup while acting with full passion and energy in a leadership role in another organization. I gave 120% in both roles and still never had the feeling of doing enough. As my two co-founders worked full-time on rePhil, I was often unaware of certain progress, obstacles or steps we had taken. I wasn’t part of all meetings and to move fast, some decisions had to be made without my vote. This created inevitable friction with my co-founders. After half a year of very little sleep, exuberant highs and devastating lows, we realized, after some long conversations that if we want to get the startup off the ground, all founders would need to commit to the project full-time. This realization didn’t feel right. The canteen market was struggling, and our planed pilot got postponed for an undetermined amount of time. We were very consumed with figuring out our team situation which made our motivation hit rock bottom. On the other side, my work with AustrianStartups energized and inspired me through interesting discussions with our ELP fellows and new projects that were constantly evolving. Almost a year later, I faced the same decision – rePhil or AustrianStartups? #2 You don’t have to be a founder to be an entrepreneur This was the most challenging decision of my life. In order to decide, I reflected on my professional journey. I realized my true passion is to inspire, connect and empower others. What gave me the most energy were the sustainable solutions that developed out of circle17, the inspiring fellows that started to implement their own ideas while participating at the ELP and the energized pupils that came up with inspiring ideas during our entrepreneurship week. Nevertheless, there remained this voice in my head, telling me that I was a phony in my role at AustrianStartups if I hadn’t founded a startup myself. It wasn’t until I realized something profound: You do not have to be a founder to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship means to be open to new ideas, to take risks in order to implement innovative and impactful ideas. This insight gave me the final nudge to focus on my entrepreneurial role within AustrianStartups. #3 Focus sets you free The decision to downgrade my involvement with rePhil, as hard as it was, opened the possibility to focus my energy on AustrianStartups. It allowed me to reflect and take the concept of our programs much further. Even though others felt that I was doing a great job before, I finally felt that I could truly own the leadership position that I signed on for a year ago. Just at that time, AustrianStartups got the chance to launch the dream that was three years in the making: to bring entrepreneurship into grade schools. My commitment to AustrianStartups freed Markus to take a step back from the operational management and focus on working on a more strategic level, putting our NPO more a financially sustainable foundation. We can bring AustrianStartups much further by truly co-leading the organization, which is why, from now on, AustrianStartups has two managing directors: Markus Raunig and myself, Hannah Wundsam. I am excited for this next chapter at AustrianStartups and am confident that together with our amazing team, we can inspire students to make their ideas reality by bringing the inventor spirit into schools, making the entrepreneurship ecosystem more inclusive throughout Austria and helping the government understand which barriers they need to do away with to create an environment in which founders can flourish. Even though, combining my work with rePhil and AustrianStartups was demanding, I don’t regret the experience. I went through the struggles and thrills of an early stage founder and now feel 100% confident that with my full-time commitment to AustrianStartups I can use these learnings to shape the Austrian entrepreneurship ecosystem for the better. Are you with me on that journey? Then let’s do this!","November 8th, 2020","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-300x300.jpg"
"2","https://austrianstartups.com/a-message-from-our-new-cxo/","AustrianStartups","A message from our new CXO","I never thought I would ever start my own company. Actually, until 4 years ago, I thought that entrepreneurship is something for guys who want to make lots of money quickly, talking in their own language about topics like pitching, pivoting and bootstrapping. Then I met an entrepreneur who completely changed my mind. She founded a social business and when she explained to me the concept of social entrepreneurship I felt that this was the perfect way to connect my business studies to my philanthropical ambitions. So I googled social entrepreneurship Vienna and found the Impact Hub. I joined the hub as a host, and it was only then that I learned to understand, what entrepreneurship really means. It means having a vision and implementing it in order to tackle real needs and have an impact on your customers’ lives. It means recognizing problems and finding creative ways of how to solve them. It means working together in a team of people who share your vision and who take into account long working hours and no salary in order to build something they believe in. And it means a roller-coaster of many emotional highs and lows, often happening on the very same day. Inspired by the social entrepreneurship community I really took a deep dive into the Austrian entrepreneurship ecosystem by joining [sic!]– the students’ innovation centre, working at the start-up Playroom and organising the Entrepreneurship Avenue. After being active on the ecosystem itself, I started to explore my own start-up idea, RePhil, fighting to-go-packaging waste with a circular system for reusable takeaway packaging. Now I had the chance to experience the ecosystem from the founder’s point of view, with all of its perks and challenges. I feel very privileged to have been able to make all of these experiences, which started by a first introduction to the concept of entrepreneurship at Impact Hub. Now, that the ecosystem has shaped me I am proudly joining AustrianStartups to take on the position of a shaper myself. Austria has amazing preconditions for founders. An educated customer base, affordable living situations, a fitting size to test a product or service and great talent. As CXO of AustrianStartups I want to support founders who have a vision and want to have a positive impact on our society. In order to have a viable business it is crucial to be conscious of the social and ecological impact that a venture has. Therefore I am excited to lead together with my colleague Stefan and the team of RespACT the Circle17 project, where we enable cooperation between start-ups and corporates to develop joint projects that tackle the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For my first 6 months as CXO of AustrianStartups I set myself three main goals which shall help to achieve our vision to make entrepreneurship as common as skiing in Austria. To burst our bubble Entrepreneurship in Austria has not yet reached the broad population. With our next projects and events we want to target new groups who are outside of our current bubble. To foster the skills and diversity of our volunteer team Our team of more than 50 volunteers all over Austria are the heart of this organization. I see it as my responsibility to motivate and engage them so they can reach their full potential. Together as a team we can bring AustrianStartups to the next level. To grow AustrianStartups outside of Vienna We have amazing local representatives in every Austrian province. I want to tighten our relation and collaboration within the provinces so we can support entrepreneurship holistically all over Austria. I am looking forward to work together with the team of AustrianStartups to empower entrepreneurs with impactful visions and to truly make entrepreneurship as common as skiing in Austria.","October 25th, 2019","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20191022_113532-e1572002634324-300x170.jpg"

They are essential players to make the European Green Deal and the European Digital Strategy a reality. They are key in creating new jobs and sustainable European prosperity. Currently, EU27 boasts more than 80.000 startups of which 51 are unicorns. The investments raised by European startups were 41 billion US dollars in 2020, up from 36,6 billion US dollars in 2019. During Q1 2021 27 innovative companies got a valuation of more than 1 billion US dollar in Europe. At first glance, this is very positive news. However, only 13 of these companies were located in EU27 before the funding round, and only 7 of them will stay in EU27 after the funding round, which paints a much bleaker picture. In the same period, the US produced 67 new unicorns. Estonia, meanwhile, has given birth to more unicorns per capita than any other country in the world. With 7 such companies for a 1,3 million population, this represents 1 case per 185.000 inhabitants. To put this in perspective: to achieve a similar feat, Germany would have to produce more than 400 innovative companies valued at 1 billion US dollars and France more than 300. We believe that Europe should considerably step up its ambitions. A desirable “moonshot” project would be to create an environment that produces 10x more unicorns in 10 years time! To achieve these ambitious goals, we recommend a series of concrete actions, grouped in 4 main themes: Definitions & Data Talent Ecosystems Policy Advising to Member States You can access the action plan with the complete list of recommendations here.

Over the years many stood out in shaping the ecosystem in a special way and helped in creating the startup community as we would call it today. As ambassadors of the community, representatives of a certain group in the community, enablers and networkers 9 outstanding individuals have joined AustrianStartups in our advisory board. Each and everyone stands for a certain group in our ecosystem and has a specific task to support the community. Besides that they help us in realizing our mission, provide us with strategic advice and assist us with their network. Finally, they define the strategy of AustriaStartups together with the management (‘Vereinsvorstand’) to answer the most important needs of the community at the right time. “Stop talking, show us the advisory board” Right, here we go… Andreas Tschas: Startup Hub Austria Andi is the Co-Founder of Pioneers. He focuses on connecting the Austrian with international ecosystems. Birgit Hofreiter: Entrepreneurship at Universities As head of Informatics Innovation Center (i2c) at TU Vienna, Birgit has an eye on fostering entrepreneurship at Austrian universities.

Networking Partners for Social Business and Universities Impact startups are an essential part of the Austrian ecosystem. The Impact Hub Vienna is the key player for social businesses from all kinds of industries. As AustrianStartups aims to be a brand for all startups in Austria, it is the logical conclusion to connect with the local hero to foster social entrepreneurship. Not sure what Impact Startups are? Well, they are entrepreneurial ventures whose primary objective is to maximise their social impact rather than the profit. They are addressing and solving societal challenges with innovative new products and services. More than 2/3 of Austria’s entrepreneurs have studied at a university. Therefore, universities make and shape the future startups. The Entrepreneurship Center Network raises awareness of entrepreneurship among students and is an inter-university platform that connects students from different universities and disciplines. It provides them with startup related know-how and useful tools. As the most important platform for students we are happy to have a partner that is focussing on sustainably increasing the number of startups to come out of universities. Finally we want to say thank you: _to all the individuals who helped us over the last 15 months: you are awesome. _to our prime sponsor Internet Foundation Austria (IPA) who supported us in the difficult startup phase. _to all our supporting members who enable us to do our job.

"5","https://austrianstartups.com/argentinas-surprising-startup-ecosystem/","AustrianStartups","Argentina’s Surprising Startup Ecosystem","Argentina: a country, most people only connect with soy, meat and a number of economic crises. Few would expect the country to be the home of one of Latin America’s best-developed startup ecosystem, and a vast number of highly successful software companies. But exactly this is the case. Argentinian national unicorns range from “South America’s Amazon” MercadoLibre to globally active FinTechs such as Prisma. Another example is Globant, an IT-outsourcing giant counting now over 10.000 employees. And US multinationals such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and IBM are omnipresent in the capital Buenos Aires. What they all are looking for, are Argentina’s highly educated developers and engineers. Tertiary education in Argentina is free of charge and very solid, and while the University of Buenos Aires (commonly known as UBA) counts 300.000 students, in many careers it also ranks 1st on the whole continent. In general, the quality of education in Argentinian universities is certainly on the same level as their European counterparts’. Even foreign students from the Mercosur area are allowed to attend UBA’s courses without restriction or fees, which attracts additional talent from those countries. However, as the country’s economy faces high uncertainty and regular downturns, domestic companies are only capable of employing a fraction of all graduates. In IT, most graduates start their career in outsourcing companies in order to gain experience in various fields but are keen to quickly jump to more exciting jobs. Thus, for foreign companies and domestic startups, it is easier here than virtually anywhere else to find highly educated and experienced talent in the fields of software and engineering. Not to mention the highly favorable Euro-Peso exchange rate, making R&D in Argentina even more competitive. Especially for startups, the Argentinians’ education, creativity, and strong will to take risks provide a more than fertile breeding ground. Modern infrastructure is provided by 50 local coworking spaces, as well as numerous accelerators and business angel networks. To support young ventures, the city of Buenos Aires hosts major initiatives to create additional exchange between investors, startups, and larger corporations. It appears to be successful: while the overall economy may struggle, Argentina’s startup ecosystem breaks one record after another. Every single year. Most important Fields & Technologies Most startups are founded in high-tech fields such as AgTech, BioTech, FinTech, HealthTech, Machine Vision and Telecom. In total, 104 AgTech startups profit from expertise and capital by Argentina’s traditionally strong agricultural sector. BioTech and HealthTech are fueled by entrepreneurial scientists and university spin-offs, and flourish thanks to very liberal regulation. As an institution, the successful public-private company Bionnovo regularly delivers additional breakthrough innovations in the field of Gene-editing. Further, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision technologies strive, profiting from cooperation with present giants such as Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Amazon and Google, and are additionally fostered in the course of Argentina’s designated national AI plan. VC funds mainly from the US have realized the opportunity long ago, and are actively looking for startups to invest in the country. They are also fast in inviting them to San Francisco and Silicon Valley after closing an investment. They compete with regional funds such as NXTP Ventures (FinTech and AgTech) or Kaszek Ventures (Telecom and Software), and corporate venture funds run by national unicorns like MercadoLibre, Despegar and Globant, as well as domestic enterprises like YPF (energy), Litoral (BioTech), or the local branch of Telefónica (telecom). Not at least, Japan’s Softbank recently announced to invest through their Vision Fund 1 bn US$ in Argentinian startups in the years ahead. Public programs exist to match private investments with public ones, thus further increasing the investors’ leverage. Opportunities for Austria For both Austrian startups and corporations, Argentina offers numerous opportunities. While almost all companies struggle to find enough qualified and experienced IT staff and engineers in Austria (aka ”Fachkräftemangel”), these are abundant in Argentina. For startups aiming at developing software, but lacking the necessary staff on-site, outsourcing project-based software development can represent an ideal solution. Highly successful IT-outsourcers like Globant (10.000 employees) or BairesDev (800 employees) proved to deliver custom software at the same quality, but not even half the cost, compared to their European or US competitors. The smallest possible project sizes start at 5.000€. Besides hundreds of US and German companies, also Austrian ones such as Kapsch and Red Bull Media House have already exploited this opportunity. For smaller projects, more than 3.000 local IT freelancer with a fluent level of English are registered on Upwork.com alone. Hourly rates start at 20€, depending on their experience, skills and specialization. Working with Argentinians definitely provides much less friction than in other parts of the world (especially compared to traditional outsourcing to India), since they share our European culture, have a strong sense of responsibility and in general a good level of English. Another option is to directly recruit from Argentina, and invite your future employee to work on-site in Austria, as most Argentinians are very open to travel or migrate. Unfortunately, administrative barriers and visa restrictions still represent a major obstacle in this regard. If you choose to do so, be aware of a long and complex process with an uncertain outcome. After all, a total of only 2.000 Rot-Weiß-Rot cards has been granted per year. Still, a reform of the RWR-card is on its way to take effect by 2020, which will abolish the crippling requisite to prove a confirmed accommodation already when submitting the application. In addition, the minimum salary required will be lowered, and finally, the form can be submitted online. However you decide: for every company interested in Argentina, Austria’s local foreign trade center (AußenwirtschaftsCenter Buenos Aires) offers a free contingent of 8hrs of personalized services to all WKO members and is there to support you. A detailed report about Argentina‘s startup industry can be requested here. The author – AustrianStartups volunteer Philipp Schardax – was in Argentina for two months, working at the local foreign trade center by Austria’s chamber of commerce (AußenwirtschaftsCenter Buenos Aires). He supported the office in establishing a local network for startup and technology scouting, and explored opportunities for Austrian companies in the country.","November 18th, 2019","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/people-standing-on-road-beside-market-and-high-rise-1060803-300x225.jpg"

In a world café workshop format participants exchanged their impressions from their professional perspective in informal roundtables. Altogether 79 participants took part in eight roundtables comprised of stakeholder groups called Venture Capital, Legal and Tax Advisors, Event Organizers, Public Associations, Educational Institutions, Corporates, Accelerators and Incubators, and Coworking Spaces. The figure above shows the number of roundtables (between 2 and 6) in which a respective topic was mentioned in the discussion between participants about the strengths and weaknesses of the Austrian startup ecosystem. The topics were categorized according to the claims in the AustrianStartups Agenda (https://austrianstartups.com/home/austrian-startup-agenda). Future-Oriented Conditions, Entrepreneurial Thinking & Digital Skills, Public Funding, Austria as International Startup Hub, Political Structures, Private Venture Capital as well as the additional category Startups. The total number of occurrences is broken down by the proportion of positive (green), neutral (grey) and negative (red) comments. The topic mentioned most often (in four roundtables) negatively is the general legal conditions in Austria. On the other hand the extent of public funding was mentioned most often positively (also in four roundtables). What is next? Assessing the current status of the ecosystem is important, but AustrianStartups wants to do more. That is why we are organizing the workshops of the second year as future workshops and work on concrete actions targeting the 10 topics mentioned negatively most often.

"9","https://austrianstartups.com/austrianstartups-stammtisch-79-all-about-growth/","AustrianStartups","AustrianStartups Stammtisch #79: All about Growth","Growth Hacking Management What is growth hacking? Growth hacking is an intersection of product management and marketing. Could be defined as “scientific marketing” –> evidence based –> demands formulation of hypotheses and design of experiments. The ideal background of a growth hacker is IT, a developer looking into marketing (not vice-versa). Simple ways to search for a product’s market fit? Form and test hypotheses e.g. red button, green button, call to action button –> let the data speak for itself! To test a product’s market fit, begin with some research on social media and on e-commerce platforms (views, how many similar products get in people’s “baskets”). What is the connection between growth and failure? “Failure” is part of growth hacking processes but it’s not really a failure –> helps you focus on what really matters. The norm is finding things that don’t work – only 30% of growth hacks really work –> this process informs you on what to keep and what to abandon. What is the biggest misconception about growth? That good ideas apply to any product! Furthermore, people think that growth comes out of nowhere, like it happens overnight –> growth is a process that needs time (see above). It is after it has started that gains pace. When should somebody start thinking of growth? People worry too early about it. Before starting ask yourself: can this product/service grow? Do people look for it on Google? Do your research –> everything starts with the research of a problem and of its solution. What should we look into when problems arise? First of all, the idea should be valid –> go back and interview people, validate, do research for the product/market. Additionally, there should be an endoscopy concerning the skills of the team as well as on other market players. Try to find the bottleneck –> look into the data to find out what’s wrong. Human Resources Management What has HR to do with growth? Hiring is part of every growth strategy –> the product is crucial but you also need the right people to deliver! You will need a small starting team for several years that will eventually lead you into the market and then let you grow. On this smaller size success depends on chemistry, not in special skills – later with a larger team, it’s a different story. The successful team should be a good mix of people, not same personalities –> diversity! How do you understand if people fit in your company? There is never a “right” question to figure this out –> hiring includes a lot of gut feeling! There are pre-employment challenges that test skills as well as tricky questions concerning the professional approach and character of the interviewee (tip when interviewed: NEVER talk badly about your previous employer). When a hire is successful start soon with a personal development plan so people stay with you! Is company culture important? If you don’t like where you work, you don’t do the “dirty work”, so culture really matters. Though, co-founders rush to think too much ahead, and top down –> you have to engage your team when designing the company culture (e.g. workshops) – this process takes time. In any case, at the beginning you need people that will do the “dirty work” –> hands-on approach, not a not-my-task mentality. This is the difference between big established structures (corporations) vs structures in birth (startups) –> people with corporate backgrounds are not easy to adjust in the startup context. How does the recruiting process change overtime in a company? There are different pre-hiring tests depending on the stage of the company –> at first you need generalists/doers, people that want to push things further. As you grow you need more specialists and more experienced people to establish more concrete processes –> you have to think of all the steps that come before you reach 150 people in the company. At the early stage you need young professionals with growth mindset but later you will need experienced professionals – something you cannot afford at the beginning anyway. What happens when you have 40 people on board? This is the time when you need structure –> not everyone can talk to everyone any more –> need for team leads –> team jour fixes. When growing, communication becomes a major challenge and this can be solved by a trial and error approach. How to hire the best person when there are no good hires around? Be creative –> look outside of Austria, Europe etc. In any case, networking/word of mouth is the most important source for finding talent (especially for tech talent). In this direction talk to people and share your ideas and values! Do distributed teams work? You should grow in this direction only when you are really ready. Consider always your resources and if you can use them efficiently –> think thoroughly if you can truly support a team remotely. Take also into consideration the culture of the company –> there is no universal recipe! Conclusively, don’t rush, do thorough research and stick to the data for answers concerning the potential of your product/service and ask whether your team has what it takes to proceed. Keep a trial and error approach to abandon all the wrong hypotheses. Begin with a diverse team with a hands-on approach that fits the startup context, and be ready to set the necessary structures and communications channels as you grow. Talk to people about your ideas and values in order to find fitting employees for your company.

Often it depends on your position and role in the ecosystem – a crisis is considered as clear-cut opportunity from an investor’s point of view, but from a founder standpoint it may mean agony and pain. However, different sectors are different realities. As a general rule sales, fundraising and scaling become much more difficult to achieve (capital becomes scarce). All these may translate from time to time in loneliness for the founder – people stop showing up while at the same time pressure is constantly mounting. Stay focused: observe, adapt and your expectations will return rejuvenated! What do you need to consider during the crisis? Crisis periods are your chance to show that you are a truly great founder. Important things to keep on mind: Resilience is the key Creativity wins scarcity Focus on your best resources, especially on your best people Survival is everything Great founders are the ones that they are not only brave to face the challenge, but they also thrive under its pressure! How do founders thrive during a crisis? Mainly by possessing underlying assets which have been built beforehand. Such are: Strong team culture Strong and loyal hires Strong product platform When the above conditions are in place then the crisis becomes an opportunity for founders to prove their business models by pushing sales in sensible ways. The way is paved for growth in revenue but also in staff – what follows after the clouds are gone is that survivors make the most value as competition has been reduced. Is currently a good time to found a startup? Regardless the fact that intuition may tell you differently, this is a great time to launch a startup: Great time for pre-seed investment (low cost risk) No need for revenues No need for lots of employees The crisis is a great opportunity to develop your concept though, provided you observe the new reality and adapt your ideas accordingly. What if you lose investors during Corona? The most sensible or maybe the only way to proceed is to bootstrap your way through the situation. This is no time for arrogance: access your network and try to sale! If you have invested considerable amount of money yourself look for support programs from public organizations with relatively little bureaucracy (e.g. soft loans, finance access with public guarantees). Fortunately, Austria has a lot more safety nets to provide comparatively to other countries where founding a startup is a swim or die situation e.g. USA. What’s more, crowd funding is always an option and last but not least is a scheme where you trade equity for liquidity – don’t get intimidated by the idea because founders are in much stronger position than they think (without them the project will fall apart). What kind of changes should be expected from the point of Venture Capital investments? One thing is certain: there will be a lot of pressure as VCs are currently waiting and do not invest. For companies that were looking for investment rounds aggressively this means necessary change of strategy. Think about how to survive for the next twelve months by finding ways to fund yourself! Where can someone find mentoring during the crisis? To start with in your inner circle, so friends and family that care genuinely for you and your well-being. Of course, on the business side good advice and guidance can come from partners that believe in you and your concept e.g. business angels, professional mentors. In addition, nowadays there are many “unofficial” channels for business communication where you can connect with peers for feedback e.g. WhatsApp groups. The crisis stimulates communication and cooperation, since the same major problems concern the vast majority of founders and investors. Is there anything good about the crisis? Definitely: the tourists will depart. Startup enterprise is not about having fun so investors and founders that do not take it seriously enough, will get evicted by the ecosystem itself. From a time management perspective, founders could/should get the chance to focus more on their core business since lots of distractions are put on hold – time freezes in a way and they can take advantage of it. Another advantage of the current “on hold” mode is that people have more time and they want to use it productively – they are more eager and available to support promising projects. What will be the next day? This crisis will probably be the biggest accelerator of digital change that we will ever see in our lifetime. The key point for success it to lay the ground in order to grow faster than the future demand. It is certain that whoever survives the storm will come out much stronger than before. On the other side, this crisis should not be all about the survival of the digital fittest – other sectors of the economy are equally important in our lives and this is a point we must not forget! In overview Deep crisis –> will clean up the ecosystem from “tourists” Surviving needs also luck –> first and foremost you have to work your momentum hard Surprising but –> this is the right time to launch a startup Crisis –> the largest driver of digitization ever No one is unaffected –> common goal and room for collaboration Now is the time to make things work. Stick to a plan designed to survive and with lots of work your dreams will come up stronger than ever before!","April 28th, 2020","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stammtisch-Visuals-80-300x169.png"
"11","https://austrianstartups.com/change-ahead-austrianstartups/","AustrianStartups","Change ahead at AustrianStartups","I’ve just signed up for my last exam at university. For the ones who had the honour of surviving a “Studentenleben” they know what this means. After realizing what is about to happen soon I remembered that I had planned to be done a lot quicker but some 3 years ago a good friend of mine destroyed my plan by offering me the chance of a lifetime. How it all started It all started when Vlad Gozman asked me in early 2013 if I wanted to co-found an association called AustrianStartups to help startups in Austria. At that point the startup scene was mainly a group of people that all happened to have similar challenges. Pioneers Festival had taken place for the first time a couple months before, 2 Minuten 2 Millionen was non-existent and for most regular people the term “startup” had no meaning at all. It was also the year of “Nationalratswahlen” and the national government showed some distant interest in startups by inviting 2-3 stakeholders in so called “Arbeitskreise”. In fact the startup scene was a small, underestimated and a highly motivated bunch of people who were yet to be discovered by the media and the general public. If you wanted to join “die Szene” you didn’t really know where to go, but had a good start by ending up at the Pioneers Festival. Most of the stakeholders knew each other but there was no one bringing them all together to join forces for a better ecosystem. It was in February 2013 when a considerate number of stakeholders came up with the idea of creating a first-stop-shop for the community which should serve as a neutral platform for the whole startup scene. At that time I had just quit my old job to finish my Bachelor degree and was very much interested by the idea to work on a platform to promote and support startups. Quickly we found other determined people to join the founders team and were convinced a little meetup here & there and some information on a website or social media will do. A typical 5-10 hours a week thing for me they said. Well, it escalated quickly. I think the idea got momentum when we found our first financial supporter, the netidee. That was when I decided to fully commit to AustrianStartups to make it bigger with an already big volunteering team. Making a difference Today I look back completely astonished. Not only was it an illusion that we’d just have a little “Verein” going on but we didn’t see the potential of the support and opportunities for the whole community, startups and stakeholders. Not in my wildest dreams could I have imagined what would become of AustrianStartups and what impact our work would have on real people. What do I mean? At one Stammtisch a startup founder approached me: “You know, it was the Stammtisch that helped me to find out what my startup is all about. You guys provided me with the first support I needed”. I was happy and surprised at the same time. A couple of months later Hansi Hansmann gave some insights on the Runtastic Exit Deal on the Stammtisch and was approached by an Italian developer. 2 days later she was invited for an interview at one of his startups and was hired eventually. We really did something useful that had an impact on people. But beside these real life experiences we soon realized not only on a 1 on 1 basis we could help but also on a higher level. 2 days after we made a proposal to minister Sebastian Kurz about taking the Austrian startup scene to Silicon Valley we were invited to seriously plan that thing. One month later we were already sitting at Google HQ with a selection of startuppers from Austria. Not that we were the first to suggest such a thing but it was AustrianStartups who could realize it, and I was in the middle of it, negotiating between stakeholders, political cabinet members and ministries. It was earlier that year when there was some serious chatter about a new Crowdfunding bill. As usual we talked to the folks in charge and offered the community perspective on things. The minister in charge was Rudolf Hundstorfer, so we asked for a working meeting. We first started with the chief of cabinet and had a profound discussion about why such a bill makes sense, why and how startups have an impact on innovation and the economy etc. I was there with my colleague Daniel and totally amazed: the chief of cabinet was really interested and we could help him understand a lot of relevant stuff. But wait a minute… we were just a community platform and there was an important decision maker willing to listen to arguments and trying to understand more about startups. We were sitting in the bloody ministry and explaining stuff. Wait, something went terrible well here J. The conversation continued and later that year the “„Alternativfinanzierungsgesetz“ (AltFG)” passed. As many of you are aware we have a quite strong social media presence. In our newsletters, Facebook, Twitter etc we put all the relevant stuff for the community. A couple of weeks ago a founder happily reported she really had made some sales because she was featured in the newsletter. There are many more stories like this but it is moments like these that make me realize that we have created something useful. It is very much at the beginning and yet has to improve but we are on the right track. Would anyone of the founders have thought we would discuss with ministers, really have an impact on startups and improve the ecosystem? Me, definitely not. In the end it was the startup community who made that whole thing possible by helping AustrianStartups to promote and support startups in Austria. Startup Scene 2016 October 2016, the Austrian startup community has changed over the years: nowadays it is not about building a local ecosystem but helping to create global competitiveness. It’s more on the international uplink and changing policy & culture and not only providing a common voice within Austria. AustrianStartups has grown over the years from a grass roots movement to a respected player in the ecosystem to act as neutral platform and first-stop-shop. There are big things ahead and great plans already made. My master plan AustrianStartups is my latest project so far for which I worked with an extraordinary team hard over the years to bring this grassroots movement to life. From the beginning of my time in Vienna I was a person to start things, mostly from scratch. I did so to try things, make the first move, beat my own fears & doubts or to show that it is possible. With AustrianStartups it is the same: we had the idea and we tried it, I tried it, and it worked. Even in ways we couldn’t even imagine. But in all my projects there was a certain moment when I realized “it is rolling” and the ground work is done. The perfect moment to hand over. Hand over to someone to take it from a solid fundament and build something great on top of it. I think I have reached that moment: AustrianStartups has become the neutral platform to support the ecosystem with a lot of potential. With my leadership we showed how you could sustain such an idea and what huge potential there still is. I have finished the groundwork and I am up for something new. I am about to finish university and finally able to reach this big big milestone I have been chasing over the years – my university degree.. And with this it is time to move on. Questions & Answers Tough decision? Yes it was. It has been a long process to find out when it is best to leave and hand over to someone else. Until December 2016 I will stay the managing director of AustrianStartups and will then hand over to my successor. Why now? AustrianStartups wants to adapt to the fast-paced changes in the Austrian startup community, to keep serving it the best possible way, while increasing the ties and activities with other European communities. It’s time for the next phase to make the change from a grassroots initiative to a dynamic organisation. I am finishing university and always wanted to bring AustrianStartups to a certain level that someone could take over and make it bigger. The end? It is rather the beginning of a more professional AustrianStartup, that is making the next logical steps. The board and the advisory board – we all have made enough experience to continue the work so that the idea and the vision of AustrianStartups will be worked on. AustrianStartups is a community initiative so it’s again the community to come up with a new AustrianStartups MD. Learnings, anyone? (My very personal learnings which may or may not apply for some of you folks) CEOs/Politicians are humans too: I talked to top CEOs & top political people and found out that they are humans like everybody else ;-). There is no need to be afraid, just be yourself, be well prepared and get your facts strait. Set yourself a goal: when working in a big volunteering team you all need something concrete to work for. Set goals or KPIs so that you can work focused and get motivated when you reach those goals Think about the legal stuff: when starting new things sooner or later you should consider the legal framework. It’s about the team: get the right people around you and do not to be afraid to say bye to people that do not perform or fit in the team. It is better for the person, the whole team, the project and ultimately for you. Honesty pays off: to be true to yourself, honesty to the team and to your customers and partners pays off. At first it may seem weird or even rough but in the end it makes your peers appreciate your decisions even more. My end? #Not. I will see where I will go but one thing is for sure: I definitively fell in love with the startup community. In case you have an exciting project, get in touch with me.

"12","https://austrianstartups.com/cto-translation-important-code/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #45: CTO? Translation is more important than code.","The trials and tribulations of that ever-illusive Tech… ‘Where to get your tech?’ or as many consider, ‘How far can you take your business idea without a technical team member?’ Both are key questions that occupy founders’ thoughts, opinions are diverse and business growth models vary. My name is Allie and I’m a newbie volunteer at AustrianStartups. Recently moving to Vienna myself, it is a question I asked too when I tried to found my first company whilst at university in London. Still, as a Startup enthusiast and a British native with much to learn, Austria to me is an interesting place to found a company – full of opportunity and from my recent experience, still a deep sense of do it yourself grassroots entrepreneurship which makes me excited about my time here. Last month, I attended my first AustrianStartups Stammtisch #45 where a few methods applied by some well-known startups to the topic ‘tech’ where discussed. Silvia Hecher, Juno Fertility, outsourced with a limited technical knowledge but enough to communicate to a small agency and after the product launch learned that she needed in house. To the opposite, Anyline, having a team of 4 technical founders one of which, Daniel Albertini, was present for questioning. And finally, Fredrik Wendschlag, PAYUCA, a company that was built on an idea with founders from varied background without a tech guy, a bit of self-taught code and now a recently acquired a CTO. Of course, acknowledging that the product or sector the startup is in will ultimately determine tech, the conversation began… Daniel quickly commented ‘Don’t find a tech guy! Hack a version by yourself,’ easy enough for a guy who started a company with 4 tech co-founders to say, no? But he had a point – you really want to at least test the proof of concept before spending a lot of money bringing in resources and technical help. Fredrik, however, nuanced ‘getting the resources of another, either an individual or an agency you get very big very quickly’. Daniel rephrased ‘At least bootstrap an MVP by learning to basic code,’ great idea, yes… and here’s the but… It does involve a commitment to learning which in some cases can leave the Startup worse off, let me explain using Silvia as an example. Silvia led her health tech product with her domain experience, a medical background. If she had decided to learn to code, the time constraint alongside focusing her energy on basic code rather than the bigger picture would inevitably led Juno Fertility down a less solid path. Silvia made sure she knew enough to communicate her ideas with a technical person but didn’t take her learning any further – more time to focus on what she is good at. Best time to bring on technical team members? The general consensus seemed to be after the MVP ‘You can easily hack or bootstrap an MVP with little technical background to test your product’ (this comment was again made by the panels resident tech guy Daniel – however it did seem agreed upon). BUT, before the launch with real customers ‘Out of the study environment and into reality, the product changes, customers don’t always behave in expected ways and bugs will appear almost immediately – at this point you really want someone on the team, outsourcing can mean ‘waiting for days for the fix’ or you also lose the ‘feedback circle’ meaning that a full understanding of the code and system can get lost in long distance communication… Or, lost in badly built selfcode – comments from Frederik of bringing in a technical founder where the system already built and can frankly be a mess. This means a lot of time fixing ‘which created a greater workload than if they had been there earlier on’. So, what do you look for in a CTO? When you are looking for a founder team the ‘fit’ is more important than even technical ability for both the potential CTO and current founding team. The CTO should be ‘more of a translator than a coder’ – there becomes a point in the future where the CTO starts to code less and less, you need someone who ‘understands where the product is going, who can bring ideas to that and also who knows what other talents and skills are needed in the team when it comes to expanding to achieve the goal.’ That said, finding the CTO is a j..o..u..r..n..e..y… and one which does not happen overnight, Silvia advertised for over 6 months receiving approximately 50+ CVs of which she interviewed 7. “I looked for some key aspects during the search ‘Ability to explain and clarity in the product’ someone who ‘believes in the product’ or ‘brings ideas about the code or the functioning already to the interview, already introducing new paths and directions for the company’”…. As you can see, criteria that is not so easy to find on paper… And it wasn’t! After hiring somebody for another role the correct CTO was found in their network. Life hack: Do not despair if you are currently in a ‘no tech bubble’!!! as your idea grows so will your network in a similar way. Other founders from the crowded room also shared their advice, ‘As a CTO you need to be a good communicator.’ Or that also making sure that if you do decide to code yourself, ‘make sure you are aware of and fulfill any Austrian standard rules and regulations.’ And then finally but, perhaps the most interesting question of the evening, ‘Do you have to give away a lot of equity to bring on a CTO?’ – yes the equity so integral to start-ups early stages. Answer: No (phew! To those with ideas but no tech) – However it can depend on how involved the CTO wants to become, for instance where they are in their own career development or as it was also put, ‘if you want an entrepreneurial CTO then that person will tend to want shares.’ Whilst this can be great, due to the person becoming invested in the product and the mindset of the company it came with a warning…. Be careful, and ‘Vesting’ should definitely be introduced – this involves planned equity over time, which even the 4 original tech founders at Anyline had agreed on, a pre-nup so to speak for business marriage. My first AustrianStartups Stammtisch was a success, I learnt a lot and met many other like-minded people in my new home meaning that I can’t wait for the next Stammtisch on the 16th May – ‘How to find the right Investor?’. KEYWORDS CTO – chief technological officerMVP – Minimum Viable Product, usually used with a test group or as initial proof of concept to attract investors.DOMAIN EXPERIENCE – refers to an area of human endeavour, an autonomous computer activity, or other specialized discipline.

What was great, what was missing? Did you find what you were looking for while browsing a store? How easy was it to get support on a purchase you made? Did you discover a new feature after updating your favourite app? All of these experiences have two things in common. First, they can make or break a business. And second – those experiences are all subject of good design. “People are constantly looking for new and better ways of doing things”, according to Katie Dill, VP of Design at Lyft (via McKinsey). Her role is at the intersection of design and business, which proves to be a success factor not only for Lyft. Research shows that design-led companies have 32% more revenue than other companies. Maurizio Poletto, Managing Director at George Labs, is one of the design professionals that transitioned from his role as owner and Creative director of his own agency into to one of the biggest banks in Austria and CEE. Following his desire to make a profound difference, his mission is to help people understand how banking works, making sure they can take care of their money since banking is among the most important things in life “after love and health”. While more and more design professionals that enter the C-suite, it is not really clear what the CDO (Chief Design Officer) is accountable for (read more here). Paulo Ferreira, Creative Director at Braintribe works with people who approach him at a very early stage of a project. He uses his role as an external advisor to challenge ideas from the beginning. In his experience, business and design priorities are often very different. Are CEOs lacking understanding for creativity? Do designers need more training in business and economics? What matters in the end, for designers as well as for CEOs, is the satisfaction of the end-user. Our poll among aspiring entrepreneurs showed that 95% see the end user happiness as the best business decision driver. Seeing opportunity and solving problems are the two unifying objectives of design and business, tackled from different perspectives and with different skills. To generate business value from design, you have to be clear about your goals, needs and available resources: Just starting out with your company? Nothing wrong with templates that can be edited. Unless you have a knack for design, getting professional advice can help you balance uniqueness and familiarity. You want to be memorable when you are scaling your business. Do you want to improve your product and challenge your ideas? Onboarding a designer or agency from the beginning can be a valuable asset, testing and challenging your ideas and goals before going down the wrong road. If the designer has a clear understanding of your business goals, she or he can help you find new opportunities. Do you want to foster a culture of creative experimentation? Think of starting your in-house design department! Look for the right attitude that matches yours and discard factors like age or experience – you might have to do some convincing that working for one company provides many opportunities and is everything but boring. Uncertain times require improved problem-solving strategies. Bringing in different perspectives and skills, like those of a designer, can be the opportunity to find and solve new problems that have not been addressed yet. As Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO argues in this article: “I believe that this moment will turn out to be one where design and creativity show their essential value“. How important is design for your business? Are you implementing creative thinking to your problem-solving process? What is your opinion on working with external agencies vs. having an in-house design department?","July 10th, 2020","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Design_ttt-300x161.png"
"14","https://austrianstartups.com/differing-regulations-and-what-we-can-learn-from-n26/","AustrianStartups","Differing regulations and what to learn from N26","Regulations dictate the rules in which businesses have to work within to protect enterprises and consumers alike. However, differing national regulations can be a real pain for startups and can be a significant barrier to global expansion. Despite a high degree of harmonisation within the EU, these variations in rules can slow down expansion and in the worst case halt it in entirely. According to AustrianStartups’ own Startup Monitor published this year 9 out of 10 startups in the country expect to be internationally active in the near future with 30% of revenue being generated already outside of Austria. Of those international revenues, the clear majority are made in EU countries and specifically Eurozone countries. Although physical distance explains some of this, for many technology companies this should be less of a problem. One of the main challenges as stated by nearly half of Austrian startups is that of differing regulations. This is especially true in areas like fintech and health where more stringent regulations require additional licenses. The experience of the digital banking upstart, N26, is a good example of this. N26, a fintech offering mobile banking solutions has successfully expanded abroad and is rapidly becoming a household name in the European banking industry. Founded by Austrians Valentin Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal in 2013 and with over 1 million clients across Europe, the companies’ founders started N26 due to frustrations with the banking experience offered by traditional banks. Among many benefits, N26 makes foreign transactions cheaper and offers a far more user-friendly service. In 2016, N26 obtained a banking license from the ECB allowing them to offer a complete banking platform. Speaking to the N26 team they told me that they did this in order to control a larger part of the value chain enabling them to develop and implement state-of-the-art technologies, launch new products for customers quickly, and be more flexible towards internationalisation. Obtaining the ECB license was a major step forward for N26. At the initial product launch in 2015, N26 (at the time Number 26) cooperated with a banking partner, which provided the infrastructure and the regulatory framework. Back then N26 was available in only Germany and Austria. However, after receiving its banking license in 2016, N26 now can launch products in different markets much faster. With clients in 17 different countries, N26 has successfully expanded overseas, although success outside of the Eurozone will require obtaining new licenses. The company will therefore launch their app in the US with a partner bank and a full license must wait for now. This highlights the regulatory difficulties that Fintechs face but it is also worthwhile acknowledging that Austrian startups should look to take advantage of common EU rules. The rapid growth of N26 is testament to the company’s conviction in what it is trying to achieve but also the effort it has applied to understanding and to obtaining the regulatory licenses it requires. Alex Weber, the Head of International Markets had this advice, “as an entrepreneur, innovator or disruptor you will receive a lot of feedback. It is important to focus on your goals and sometimes to ignore some feedback as well as to build a team that drives the project to success”. No regulatory barrier is a barrier too high to climb, you just have to approach it the right way.","November 13th, 2018","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AlliedForStartups-e1543494022376-300x274.jpg"

Making money, or becoming rich shouldn’t be on your mind as an entrepreneur – that should ideally be the side effect that will happen if you create real value”. Born to be entrepreneur Markus Linder developed very early on a strong interest for problem solving. Already as a teenager, he got himself into the habit of coming up with a new business idea every day, usually crazy ones, but sometimes also ideas with potential. The beginning Zoovu was his first startup company, a SaaS startup that he launched as a student at the Vienna University of Business and Economics together with his co-founders. His vision? To empower consumers by assisting them in choosing products according to their needs when shopping online. The company grew very fast, raising funds in several investment rounds and gaining more and more customers. Once the company had reached more than 100 employees and grew at a triple-digit growth rate, he decided to hand the company over to a highly experienced scale-up CEO. Markus decided that it was time to move on because sales processes’ optimization and new market entries were not what he is passionate about: “My passion is to build things from scratch”. The great travel(s) Is it difficult or sensible to leave a successful company in full expansion ? This is what Markus did: he stepped down from his operational role at Zoovu remaining as of today the largest individual shareholder of the company – and took a sabbatical to travel. What he experienced during this time are the disastrous impacts of climate warming on nature: glaciers disappearing, extreme temperatures and weather conditions are already happening. It became clear to him that his next challenge would be related to the two greatest challenges of humanity: biodiversity loss and climate change: “I am not sure whether everyone is really aware how dramatic the situation really is. We as humans have brought one million species to the brink of extinction”. As an Impact Investor, he actively supports companies whose business plan is to mitigate these two major crises – “That became a very interesting part of my professional career and my experience as an entrepreneur at the other side of the table”. The comeback It did not take him long to come back with a new business idea tackling the environment crisis. How could he empower millions of consumers who want to have a positive impact on the planet to consume more responsibly? inoqo was born. “Politicians need to do a lot and move the needle massively, but if we as consumers don’t show that we are serious about mitigating these two crises, our politicians won’t either”. inoqo will empower consumers to trace the impact of their purchase decisions, while staying true to their personal priorities and values. Users will get a direct overview of the impact their choices have on the planet e.g. how much habitat they can support for other species by avoiding products with non-certified palm oil, or how much CO2 emissions they have saved throughout the week. Valuable skills What are the skills that Markus came to regard as particularly important in his hitherto entrepreneurial journey? a) Visionary thinking i.e. being able to create business models with a unique vision that tackle great challenges. b) Persistence which means staying focused and embracing hard facts instead of looking for cutting corners e.g. easy exit, and staying loyal to the vision. c) Creating a culture for talent that is, being genuinely interested in the personal (not only technical) development of your people – such an approach attracts great talent. Advice to prospective entrepreneurs “Getting rich should not be the goal but a side effect” – creating value should be at the center of your practice. Before anything else, think how you can contribute to solving really big challenges out there and not how to copy already established solutions. Last but not least “Focus on a business model that makes an important contribution but is also scalable across the world”. “Every tiny little step that each and every one of us can take in our life as parents, as consumers, as employees, as entrepreneurs, as investors, as citizens will be really crucial to avoid the complete crash”. A crucial learning “Being an entrepreneur is important, but other things are important as well in life”. In the early days he used to work up to 80 hours/week but this was harming his passion. Freeing your mind with other things, e.g. practicing Yoga or going for a run early in the morning is crucial – it “helps me make proactive choices instead of floating in the middle of the river or running in the hamster wheel”. A final message “With the things people buy, they vote with their money for the world they want to live in” – right now we vote for deforestation and for the cruel treatment of animals. “The good news is that more and more people are becoming aware of that” and fortunately, this ballot opens every day.

Don’t be afraid of taking risks – there is a solution for everything.” 8 companies. 2 failed (“successfully” liquidated). 1 currently on the best path of becoming a unicorn. Ibrahim Imam, Entrepreneur at heart, father of 2, loves to shape a company with his vision and give something useful (back) to the community. Stick to your domain Ibrahim started young to create side businesses in order to finance his studies in Business Informatics. One was “Lern im Team” [Learn in Groups, Ed.] which was a tutoring school connecting students with pupils to help each other out with studying. Next business pioneered the SaaS space and made it to the incubator of INiTS. Another one was a Food StartUp, which, despite branching out to 3 stores, failed in the end. His advice: “Stick to changing the industry you have know-how about”. And sticking to his domain paid off. Now, looking back at almost 2 decades of Entrepreneurship in Austria, he is one of the 5 Co-founders of PlanRadar, a scale-up PropTech providing services to clients such as STRABAG & Co, and currently expanding to the Nordics, Russia, Poland, France, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, UAE and Australia. PlanRadar is a solution for documentation & communication in construction and real estate projects. The Unique Selling Proposition? Be on-boarded in less than 10 minutes, usable everywhere in the world, and saves about 7 hours per week to the average employee in the construction industry. Digitilization is not a question anymore in times of Corona; “it’s there, people need it to continue with their businesses. Only hunting is less digitized than construction”. Listen to your gut So, how do you get from clients asking to install a CD for your first solution in 2005 to self onboarding in 2020? Ibrahim explained 3 crucial skills: The Selling & The Negotiating: The best idea sold poorly is worth nothing: “Learn everything about selling and generating revenue from along the whole sales funnel.” While it’s crucial in his job to be closing deals, Ibrahim tries not to bargain and rather create a win-win situation through understanding the needs of the other party. The Gut Feeling: Listen to your gut feeling for both decisions and people; then compare the initial feeling to the actual decision taken later on, and learn how to close that gap over the years. “The best part about being an entrepreneur? Being able to learn everyday from smart people, hire them later on, and shape your vision in the way you want it to be.” This same gut feeling should be listened to when deciding whether to take on the entrepreneurial path, Ibrahim advises. “It’s not a 9-5 job – pick something that you love doing and you are really good at or want to be good at, and talk to loads of people who have done it.” While getting their advice, stay critical and check their track record. Then match the findings with the initial vision for one’s life: “You know your personal situation best”. In the end, everyone’s the constructor of his/her own life.

"17","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-10-sejla-softic/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #10: Sejla SOFTIC","Name: Šejla Softic Since 10 years: Entrepreneur, Artist, Teacher, Dancer, Choreographer, Dance Educationalist Recipe for success: know your community Biggest motivation: people who count on you Personal life motto: be consistent & write ideas down Meeting the Artist Colorful, homey, inspiring – those three words flash through your mind when entering arriOla association dance studios in the heart of the Viennese artsy scene, or any other of their franchised dance studios all around Austria. Advocate of this atmosphere is the person sitting behind the counter, or rather the bun that I see when approaching the front desk. The person behind the bun looks up, smiles with the brightest grin I’ve seen in months, takes off her black headphones and greets me like she knows me. This is Šejla Softic, an artist through and through. Notorious choreographer, respected teacher, dancer, performer, artist and above all, human being at heart. Her choreographies have filled arenas at the Dance Star World Finals’ Gala Night, Stadthalle Wien, and Dschungel at MQ. How did she get there? Meeting the Demand During her English & Psychology studies, Šejla wanted to do something useful and impactful – she joined arriOla association dance studios as Manager and Chairwoman and has been a part of writing Austrian dance history ever since. Together with Rebekka Rom, who is the Founder of arriOla association dance studios, she followed the scene’s wishes and demands: They first started out by giving dance classes, then raised dance educationalists (Tanzpädagogen), opened Austria’s very first dance-kindergarden (riOriO), founded various artists & talent agencies and established successful competition teams for the World Dance Finals in Porec – the scene liked it, arriOla adapted to the dancers’ needs, and word of mouth did the rest. Leading From the Heart A decade later, Šejla can look back at being the driving mind and force behind establishing a professional dance education in Austria, managing arriOla into a franchise business, and growing the community from the bottom of her heart. “You have to be willing to go beyond regular work hours if you want to succeed and if you want to do as much as I have been doing”, Šejla concludes. How did she build a dance studio almost from scratch? “Everything was learning by doing. Not having guidance made me make mistakes I could learn from and grow.” Šejla never left the teaching side in order to know what’s needed and to connect with the community on a personal level. Consistency, excellent customer service, and a team with the same values that supports each other helped her grow arriOla into its current size. Her secret formula: “Let people be who they are and stay up to date with the latest trends. The rest will follow.” Writing Dance History “Dancing has been my hobby, and suddenly it became my job. Then it became a job that you can offer to other people. Then it grew into something that you can actually commercialize.” After a decade, Šejla realized she’s actually been working all along, despite people telling her to get a real job. “The dance scene in Austria is so small that what we do is still not considered a real job.” They don’t have unions nor special contracts, for instance, unlike other industries where those frameworks exist and don’t need to be built up from scratch. Nonetheless, people love the movement and dancers/artists benefit from it. Every year, five to ten dance educationalists graduate from the KKTP (Kolleg für kommerzielle Tanzstile und –pädagogik) Program laying more ground for the whole industry to grow. Additionally, Šejla offered seminars for Musik Uni Wien, Pädagogische Hochschule Krems et al. on integrating dance into the school curriculum. “Dancing is actually part of the school curriculum. A lot of teachers wanted to learn how to move with their children in the classroom.” The best part of her vocation: “We are still writing dance history. Someone even stated in a press conference recently that Sport clubs (Vereine) in Austria are considered a cultural treasure. Being able to be a part of creating that history for Austria – and the whole scene is contributing – that’s just the most amazing thing.” Surviving Existential Crisis Most dancers/artists are self-employed, so the Corona wave brought a whole existential crisis upon the scene. Šejla had to watch her fellow artists struggle with paying rent the coming month or having false messages circulating in the media. What do you do when your bread and butter comes from working with the community? “Main thing I’ve acquired is listening to myself, to my body and to my mind, and just accepting the way you feel today. Taking it one day at a time.” It was unclear how long the studios will be closed, as dance studios legally differ from fitness centers and also from the classic Viennese dance schools for ballroom dance. While waiting and writing an open letter for governmental instructions, virtual classes have become the new norm. ArriOla was offering online classes for free because they wanted to be there for their community. People who have already paid for the Semester-pass, could ask for a voucher for the following semester, for their money back or also donate the money. Despite the pandemic, the association still had to cover monthly costs. “We are aware that our community is strong. How strong we’ve realized during this crisis. Almost nobody asked for their money back. It was a small miracle. They supported us as much as they could, and still do. In times like these, people appreciate what they have.” #VieDance #VieCare #VieShare Dancing is nurtured by the community and things move fast in small communities. “You can’t be a solo artist in the dance industry all the time, it’s just not right for that. Connecting with other studios is something everybody benefits from. So, together with other Viennese dance studios, we started this movement #VieDance #VieCare #VieShare of supporting our dance community psychologically and physically during Covid-19.” With everything being out in the open on Instagram (and TikTok), the choice of dance classes became endless: “Everything in the world is going more local; the dance scene, however, has become more global with access to teachers worldwide through online classes.” An artist – To be, or not to be The big question mark remains. With the repercussions of the pandemic, should young fellows still follow their dream of being an artist? “Get a back-up plan and be very patient. Try to earn some money on the side. Being an artist is about contributing to the community and giving something of yourself, expressing yourself. It’s not necessarily only about making money. If you don’t have that willingness, then you shouldn’t become an artist. Because that’s what being an artist is about.” In a world where online giants have become the main platforms for artists, how do you generate followers when any artist worldwide is at your fingertips; how do you attract an audience as a newbie? “You have to be realistic. Nowadays, you need to understand economics, be able to work with a smartphone, computer, other artists, and use Instagram as your main platform to reach people. You need to find out what you want to do, what makes you unique. If you want to get started, you just have to do it. In order to do it, you have to formulate what you want to do and writing down ideas has always helped me. Whether it’s vision boards, diaries, to-do lists, calendar entries, recordings – whatever feels good for you. As an artist, just write down and document everything.” Artists Post-Corona? The yearn for culture has peaked during Corona. While shows and performances have been cancelled, confinement has surged – ironically – a cultural desire of the masses. “People have now realized that we are all in the same boat, we all have the same problems, and we all share the same passion. I think this could be a chance for Austria to integrate the dance scene a little bit more into the whole cultural sector. Artists are needed. They will always be needed. But in times of crisis, they are the first ones you don’t want to pay any longer.” Next week: Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger, Erdbeerwoche In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

Are you crazy? Now, 9 years later we’ve managed to educate millions of women, tens of thousands of adolescents, and replaced over 7 Million conventional tampons and pads with organic alternatives.” Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger are two pioneers in Women’s Health: Together they built the social business erdbeerwoche, which focuses on education around menstruation and organic menstruation products. From starting their company 9 years ago to becoming successful entrepreneurs and educating millions of women on the topic of menstruation, how did their journey start, what was their experience like and what is their recipe for success? Identifying a Niche (That Affects 50% of the Population) Before starting erdbeerwoche, Annemarie and Bettina both worked in the sustainability sector for many years, where they worked closely with companies to make them more sustainable. During that time, they randomly came across an announcement from a company that produced organic tampons, and quickly realized that there’s a massive gap and therefore a huge opportunity available in this space: “We wouldn’t have expected at this point that this announcement will change our lives, and will turn us into entrepreneurs.” They went on to do more research on this topic, and “we quickly realized that somebody has to fill this niche – and that’s how erdbeerwoche was born. As a side mission, we also wanted to break one of the last taboo topics of our society – the menstrual cycle.” erdbeerwoche quickly grew to be the first social business in Austria that specializes in menstruation. Their business now includes three key pillars: erdbeerwoche.com, a platform for menstrual education, including READY FOR RED, a digital education platform which teaches adolescents important knowledge about menstruation. For this education effort they partner with public authorities and companies. For example, with the organic pad brand Organyc, where each package comes with a free access pass to READY FOR RED.The second pillar is the erdbeerwoche-Onlineshop, where people can find all organic products that they need during their periods, including organic tampons, menstrual cups, and their self-produced fair trade period panties. In addition, as a third pillar, they are involved in political work where they have been active to lower the tampon tax for many years (which has already successfully happened in Germany) or for more transparency about the ingredients of monthly hygiene products. It Doesn’t Always Matter What Everyone Else Thinks Annemarie and Bettina can show impressive traction with what they’ve built with erdbeerwoche: “Now, 9 years later, we’ve managed to educate millions of women, tens of thousands of adolescents, and replaced over 7 Million conventional tampons and pads with organic alternatives.” The critical voices that they were initially surrounded with quickly understood the value that Annemarie and Bettina were delivering: “Nowadays, we’re no longer being frowned upon, on the contrary – the topic of menstruation has reached a positive turning point in our society, and that’s great!” What made Annemarie and Bettina so successful when building erdbeerwoche? They mention that it is important to believe in yourself and your skills: “Even if people in your surroundings may not always be encouraging, it is very important as an entrepreneur to believe in your mission and to stick to it. But also, to recognize if a path you’re taking is not the right one, and choose another.” When asked about the 3 most important skills as an entrepreneur, Annemarie and Bettina mention “the entrepreneurial thinking, the courage to leave known paths and try something new, as well as grit: Never give up!” The Rollercoaster of Entrepreneurship “The most amazing part about being a social entrepreneur is to wake up every morning and to know that today you have the possibility to make the world a better place,” Annemarie and Bettina mention when asked about the parts of entrepreneurship they really like. However, they also describe the more difficult aspects of entrepreneurship, such as staying positive in challenging times, and finding the self-motivation to push through. In these times, it’s extremely helpful to have a co-founder and work on this as a team, as “it’s easier to get over a crisis when it’s two of you – you can lift each other up if needed”. Overall they describe the entrepreneurial journey as a huge adventure, including a rollercoaster ride: Once the ride is over, you’d want to start again!

"19","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-12-stefan-yazzie-herbert/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #13: Stefan Yazzie Herbert","Name: Stefan Yazzie Herbert Current Position: Co-Founder of House of Bandits Recipe for Success: Creativity, Collaboration and Learning “I want whatever I do to be impactful. And what I can do here is to spread the word of creativity, collaboration and learning.” Necessity is the mother of invention “At the beginning of our entire business model, it was just a couple of friends trying to get cheap rent.“ Stefan Yazzie Herber has not planned to become an entrepreneur, initially. In fact, it rather started with a community of people who were working together and needed an office space. Being creative and bold, Stefan and his cofounder Dominik decided to turn a completely run-down building with almost no infrastructure into an office space – with their own hands. As they were building the space, they have come to realize that it was indeed a business that they could build up. Their mission was about empowerment and growth through cooperation – for everyone. Today, “House of Bandits” is a co-creation space, an advertising agency, and most importantly: a community. Starting from zero When starting from zero, money struggles were inevitable. However, with an entrepreneurial spirit one can always find a way: In order to save money, Stefan and his co-founder decided to make use of the marketplace platform Willhaben and used material at construction sites that nobody wanted. They discovered how far one can get with recycling free things and therefore got the most out of everything and eventually succeeded in building something Learn how to learn, adapt, and juggle As his most valuable skills, Stefan cannot stress enough the importance of learning how to learn and also adapting one’s self-learning accordingly. As an entrepreneur, being confronted with all kinds of situations, setbacks and surprises is part of one’s everyday life. In order to be capable of coming up with suitable solutions, being able to learn new things fast is crucial. Apart from that, Stefan equates his chaotic process with one of his hobbies: juggling – “It’s a habit thing, the longer you practice juggling, the more balls you’re able to juggle. And the same goes for projects. Over time, you’re just able to keep your mind on many more projects. When you don’t have to look when they go up in the air, you can look somewhere else. But when they come back down, you have to be there with your full attention.“ Least favourite failure Stefan had to learn the hard way that substance should come before image when he started a new venture with his business partner Dominik organising a drum&bass music festival “Royal Bass”. Due to ridiculously high expectations, unsolid advice and issues with the local government, the festival got into a precarious financial situation that ultimately led Stefan to be homeless for a short period of time. Nonetheless, it was Stefan’s best business learning he has ever had in his entire life – leading teams, planning festival financials and running international ad campaigns were all tasks that needed to be done and without a full-time team to handle it, it all fell to the cofounders to figure it out on the fly. Even though having unrealistic expectations is a huge part of being able to achieve great things, realistic goal-setting enables efficient planning and is therefore crucial for the success of a project. I want whatever I do to be impactful Being able to create an impact through his work is what drives Stefan to keep pushing, even when facing demanding hurdles. “What I can do here is to spread the word of creativity, collaboration, and learning.“ This is what he values in his own startup. This also applies to other areas than his passion – when thinking about which message he would share on a billboard on Stephansdom if he had the chance to do so, he would call up his friends at Fridays for Future and create a powerful message due to the urgency of the climate crisis. Jump into stuff – if it doesn’t work out, who cares? For getting started, following your own passion or someone else’s is the first step. Through volunteering, participating in impactful projects or even implementing your own projects, one can easily find his or her way into the entrepreneurial world. “Just jump into stuff, see if it works. If it doesn’t – who cares? You’re young, you can still mess up in the beginning.“ Stefan’s jump succeeded and he managed to turn a run-down building into a space full of freedom, creativity and joy with open doors for everyone – feels like everything is possible!

"20","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-13-rebekka-dober/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #14: Rebekka Dober","Name: Rebekka Dober Founder of: YEP – Stimme der Jugend. Youth Empowerment & Participation. Favourite Quote: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea*.” (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry) Pioneering in: bridging generations through impactful participation Recipe for success: Be bold, cheeky, and tenacious. Be empathetic. “What If You Could Change Anything In This World, Where Would You Start?” Almost 2 years ago, Rebekka Dober founded YEP – Die Stimme der Jugend (Voice of the Youth). It’s a social enterprise that, on the one hand, enables institutions and corporations to understand the needs and the mindset of the future generation through impactful participation processes. On the other hand, YEP empowers young people to be leaders of change through teaching them social entrepreneurship. It all started with a simple question Before her time as an entrepreneur, Rebekka travelled the world with a mission where she asked everyone she met the same question: “What if you can change something in this world, where would you start?” No matter if it was Columbia, India, or the Middle East, people answered that in their opinion education is the most powerful leverage point. Rebekkas conclusion: “In this rapidly changing world there are so many problems – climate change, discrimination, wars. To face them, we need a strong civil society. And if we want to transform society, we have to start early – with the youth.” If It’s About Them + Don’t Do It Without Them = The Yep-Effect Between her trips, she was working as an educational designer for different companies and NGOs with young people when she found out that the young people’s answers to that question were never ego-focused, but always with a social, environmental impact. They could identify the worlds’ biggest challenges and create solutions – but felt powerless, because they weren’t able to raise their voice and all the decisions for their own future were made without them. To change this, Rebekka founded YEP. From mission to business Rebekka was astonished how many stakeholders have a hard time to understand this 20 percent of the population, the youth: For politics, they are the future voters. For corporates, they are the future employees and customers. For society, they are the ones who are facing the consequences of the decisions made today. Bringing In The Independent Voice Of The Youth The social startup YEP sets up participation processes with a range of diverse activities: bringing young people on stage to discuss with decision holders from economy and politics, facilitating co-creation workshops, and creating inclusive, “youthified” events to remove the barriers between the generations. The output for YEPs customers: reports to catalyze the needs and ideas of the youth for specific topics like sustainability, new work, and equal opportunities. Within a few months only, YEP has transformed into an active crowd of young changemakers who combine the art of co-creation with society’s actual needs. YEP operated more than 35 participation processes in the last year. This journey brought the 28 year old entrepreneur to events like “European Forum Alpbach”, where she was invited as an expert for youth participation in the educational field to talk about YEPs’ report “Skills to be fit for the future” in front of the economical and political elite. Other successes were bringing the voice of the youth to the Austrian Parliament and the Council of Europe. The “YEP Youth Reports” were presented by highschool students, who were empowered by several YEP-programs that enabled them to raise their voice professionally. Be Authentic Rebekkas days differ very much from one another – the common ground is the stakeholder meetings, conceptual work, and not checking emails first thing in the day. She loves to develop ideas “from something crazy in the head to something down to earth” with like-minded people who give her energy. Be Tenacious Entrepreneurial methods became a way of tackling those societal challenges in the world. “The mindset of a social entrepreneur is her hands-on tool to change the world. I didn’t choose the industry “education”, neither did I want to strictly become an entrepreneur. I just followed my path and my vocation to change the world – and entrepreneurial methods are a way to get there.” Zebras are the new unicorns When it comes to growing her company she sticks to the concept of zebras: Slowly, but sustainable and steady. Without the desperate race of raising investors money fast and eliminating opponents. Rebekka has a strong antipathy against hustling, faking and bubbling entrepreneurs. She wants to grow her business like her personality is: “authentic, empathetic, straight forward – but never forget to also enjoy that chaotic rollercoaster.” Pivoting while lockdown During Corona, Rebekka and her crew co-created the “Weiterlernen Report”, a gap analysis about Remote Learning and the schools’ handling of technologies during the lockdown. “I can’t just sit back and watch. As an entrepreneur you have to be flexible and on point where change is needed. So we started with the ‘Weiterlernen Report’ and instead of a dead end, which Corona meant for many startups, an opportunity arose.” The report was presented in front of the ministry of education, many ed-tech startups and 1000+ teachers. Fighting for a new digital humanism Collaboration is her key to success: “It doesn’t matter if you are a teacher or part of a corporate. We all have the urge for the endless sea*, our mission. The digital revolution is not only about the tools and giving out laptops. It’s about the skills on how to use those devices meaningfully. Digital technology can be a tool to achieve digital humanism.” Be empathetic Rebekka is a mission-obsessed person that puts her team above everything. If someone wants to change something, she suggests to “be bold, cheeky and tenacious, and keep the focus on the mission. If you have an idea and feel the urge to do something and your heart is aching for it, do it. If not now, when then? Always remember, that if you don’t change something, nothing will change.” Next Week: Summary post In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

While studying Communication Design & Advertising at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna she always carried a black book with her, which she used to draw her daily inspirations, ideas, and surroundings into. “It was my visual diary”, she told us. Slowly but surely, more and more people started noticing her scribbles, drafts, and drawings and asked her to draw some designs for them. As time went by, those inquiries got more serious and more demanding, which, eventually, lead her to her first “real“ job in 2010/11 – designing Christmas cookie packaging for Ströck. This was the spark of encouragement she needed to found her own company Atelier Karasinski, in 2012, while still studying. You Need 10 Years to Be an Overnight Success Already having her first clients at the age of 19 and founding her company at the age of 21, Laura has now been in the industry for roughly 11 years. It has been a long journey ever since that was necessary to establish herself as the founder and design director of Atelier Karasinski, a Vienna-based design bureau that specializes in branding & interior design concepts, ranging from restaurants to bars and hotels, and working with a broad range of local partners such as architects, light designers, and carpenters. From the outside it might look like Atelier Karasinski was pre-destined for success; in reality, every single year of preparation, perseverance and patience was crucial for Laura and her team to get to the place they find themselves in now. And we are looking forward to what else the future will bring her. I Do Not Want What Does Not Want Me… …has become some sort of a mantra for Laura over the past few years. “I consider my work life a continuous journey, where life is my teacher and I am a lifelong student. Everything you do, see, touch, feel, learn and everyone you meet is either a lesson or a blessing. And everything that happens, happens for a reason: to learn, to improve, to do better.” As we already discovered from our past interviews of our Entrepreneurs of Austria series, this is exactly the type of mentality pivotal for a successfully trajectory as an entrepreneur in this volatile journey called life. We can’t always control what happens in the world around us, but we can control how we react to it! Practical Tips Laura also shared with us three major skills she has acquired in her life that helped her build her business: 1. Time management – minute-to-minute and day-to-day you don’t have time to think. You need to have already thought. 2. Curiosity – try out new things at least once, so you know how it is like and get help if needed. Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty. 3. Rest – taking one step back can sometimes lead to jumping two steps forward. Freedom Also Means Leading “The best part about being self-employed is the freedom that comes with it”, she told us. She praises the flexibility that comes with it and the ability to (most of the time) choose for yourself when, where and how you want to approach that upcoming task. The difficulty, however, is finding and keeping the right team. Proper leadership is key! Love More… …would be Laura’s chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s most famous trademark, the Stephansdom.

Important things first When thinking about her most valuable skills, Sophie immediately recognizes and appreciates the strength of her team. “We complement each other very well in our skills“ – while Sophie considers herself as a strategist, her co-founders have their areas of strength in design and marketing. Being a team of founders means to bear all the challenges together and therefore also to grow together. On her path of becoming an entrepreneur, dealing with the important tasks first proves not only to be an immediate stress relief, but at the same time provides a rewarding feeling of achievement, which is especially motivating to go even further. Taking the risk with joy and happiness “As a founder, you don’t have a safety net. You are willing to take the risk and you take it with joy and happiness“. Even Sophie, whose sportswear is made out of fishing nets, did not have a safety net. Nevertheless, she is not afraid of what might happen, but enjoys all the ups and downs as well as the uncertainty that comes with it. Entrepreneurship enables flexibility and also enables having the power to decide on one’s own strategy. This is not only challenging, but also exciting and highly interesting. When dealing with stressful situations, Sophie is well aware of the importance of switching off one’s cell phone and recommends spending time in nature. In order to clear her head, Sophie finds delight in the different view on everything one has while being in the mountains. Last but not least, Sophie experienced that doing sports is also an extremely effective stress-relief and brings great joy – and even more when wearing clothing relieving our oceans of plastic. Building a startup – tackling numerous global issues simultaneously Building up a startup comes with numerous challenges, and making it sustainable, is, of course, another hurdle to conquer. Whether making a real impact on our world’s future is worth the additional challenge should not be a question anymore. After a year of intensive research, Sophie finally found a sustainable fabric consistent with her values and now creates unique and innovative sportswear – tackling 3 urgent global issues at one time: waste reduction, fair working conditions, and dependence on non-European supply chains. This is possible through a special synthetic fibre called Econyl®, which is up-cycled nylon made out of old fishing nets polluting our ocean, and is thus produced under fair conditions in Portugal. Be the change you want to see The corona crisis forced people to hold and to rethink their lives, consumer behavior and daily habits. All problems the corona crisis has uncovered need to be resolved now – by us. Sophie Wirth managed to put people and planet first while building up a successful startup, and therefore paved the way for both innovative and sustainable fashion. “Be the change you want to see“ is what Sophie would share with Austria on a billboard on Stephansdom. She shows us that it is indeed possible to make a change and has already taken a step in the only direction our world can sustain in the long term. If everyone did it – imagine how our future would look like. In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

This is what we believe in and the purpose why we started TheVentury – entrepreneurial thinking and acting upon it is the best way for our society to improve and move forward.” Christoph Bitzner, the founder and CEO of TheVentury, started his entrepreneurial journey at a very young age – he has been self-employed since he was 13. After he founded and hibernated his first growth oriented startup, together with his colleagues he started supporting other startups with his know-how and experience, which was very well received and eventually led to the foundation of TheVentury. Entrepreneurship Means Constant Learning When asked about the best thing that entrepreneurship has to offer him, Christoph emphasized constant learning, “As an entrepreneur you have no other chance than to learn – while the protective layer of a safe job sometimes delays feedback and buries it below policy or false kindness.” According to Christoph, there is no better feedback than the company’s bank account. As for the most difficult aspect of his profession, Christoph deems that is dealing with uncertainty, which, ironically, also provides the biggest potential for learning and constant improvement. No Crisis for Entrepreneurs The core belief that was most useful to Christoph during his journey was the focus on the team: “The Team is Everything.” Particularly, in the light of COVID-19, which posed some various challenges but also an opportunity to showcase their capabilities, “While this is a special situation, as entrepreneurs we are better prepared for it, as we are used to uncertain scenarios”. Other skills and habits he found to be useful on his entrepreneurial journey were to develop a personal daily routine (e.g. physical activity in the morning) to keep a good balance, being vulnerable in front of others, validating and selling before building something, as well as being kind to yourself – everybody fails sometimes. Beware of Advice We also asked Christoph if he ever received bad advice. “Any advice is bad if you follow it blindly”, he shares, “I can only recommend approaching any advice with curiosity. Reflect on where the advice comes from, what experience or data led to the given advice, what viewpoint the person has of what you are doing.” In Christoph’s opinion, this always leads to an improvement of strategy, even if it’s just increased confidence about being on the right path. Progress Through Entrepreneurship When we asked Christoph what text he would put on a large billboard on Stephansdom, he answered: „Progress through Entrepreneurship“– plain and simple. This is what we believe in and the purpose why we started TheVentury – entrepreneurial thinking and acting upon it is the best way for our society to improve and move forward.” And doesn’t everyone want progress?

"24","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-18-tiago-liko/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #18: Tiago LIKO","Previously On The Entrepreneurs Of Austria In March 2020, we – a team of six – have brought to life the Entrepreneurs of Austria series in order to advocate for and foster the entrepreneurial spirit not only, but especially, within times of Crisis and uncertainty. We have portrayed founders from startups throughout various industries, artists, the self-employed, social entrepreneurs, scale-ups and agencies that have one thing in common: walk the stony path of entrepreneurship as an example for others to follow and change things that no one else dared to disrupt yet. They have shared their driving factors behind following their passions with us, their habits, their failures & successes, and have given valuable advice on what kind of skills and mindset has worked for them to achieve the seemingly impossible. As Season 1 is coming to an end, there is still one episode that we haven’t shared with you. How do you choose your career path once you are done with school or university but your passion is something completely different than your academic degree? How do you master the perks of being self-employed for the first time? And this is exactly the theme of our last portrait. So, let’s dive into it: © Aelia & the Camera Name: Tiago Liko Owner of: Liko Films Recipe for success: Be kind. Make a choice, take your passion seriously, and let your work speak for itself. Mantra: Amor Fati. Love your fate. “Certain things have to be in place for the perfect symbiosis to happen.” Make A Choice. After obtaining his Business Degree, Tiago Liko did his mandatory internship and soon realized that working for an incumbent wouldn’t fit his character. “I wanted a job because I thought that’s what I have to do after graduation. Clearly, the thought was not my own.” The lack of knowledge about his work’s ultimate purpose and of the possibility to build something up from scratch was the decisive factor of venturing out into the (yet) unknown. While contemplating that decision, things started to align for a certain path: Left Boy got wind of a music video Tiago had once made, which contained original transitions unique to the music scene. He spontaneously asked Tiago to accompany him documenting his Tour, 13 music festivals in one summer. That had been the inception of Tiago’s passion becoming a reality. Timing Is Everything. Tiago’s story begins around a decade ago, at the time when the DSLR [digital single lense reflex camera] movement was happening and YouTube was in growth phase. Tiago was part of that early movement, and put all his energy into editing, working the camera, and directing. Starting at an early age, there has always been a medium in between him and reality, captured on endless TB of footage. His videos had a unique touch to them, as he was experimenting a lot, luring the viewers’ minds in a cocoon of rhythm and music, highlighting the mood and personalities through sensible storytelling. “Filmmaking is about observing the world really carefully. Deconstructing a situation into its smallest parts; asking why things are the way they specifically are. And then, start piecing together your own stories.” No Need For A Fancy Film School. All the pieces of Tiago’s international life experiences fell into place on its own after following that certain drive, that push towards a certain direction which made him go into complete auto-deduct and learn everything there is about film making. “All my life-energy went into watching & learning filmmaking – I learned everything online, from, and with people. I built my own (online) curriculum and created a learning process that fit my learning needs.” As the jobs kept on coming in, Tiago started building his client base. He took all his work, even the tiniest document’s design and invoices, extremely seriously, and understood his clients’ real needs. Surrounded by the right circle of like-minded freelancers and artists, his videos picked up. “Certain situations, certain things have to be in place for the perfect symbiosis to happen. I picked up a camera by chance. I actually wanted to be a musician. Then I was editing music videos for musicians. Now, I am a filmmaker. An independent, 1 person company.” The Perks Of Being Self-Employed. Self-employment in Austria isn’t served on a silver platter, but the institutions are very welcoming and patient to explain the plain pallets of bureaucracy that are clashing with the colorful joys of self-employment. Tiago’s business studies finally came in handy for navigating through the Austrian self-employment system. While the US emphasizes the spirit of being a pioneer, simply create and make money, Austria is trying to scare one away with taxes and social security schemes. “My dream of becoming a filmmaker would only fail because of not understanding the Austrian system. I had been worried about doing something wrong, overseeing something and making a big mistake, so I asked a lot of questions and researched everything down to the core in order to be on the safe side.” The Element of Surprise. Sometimes life tries to tell you something through throwing obstacles at you. As Tiago was getting used to the rollercoaster of being self-employed and settling into “Austria’s comfort zone”, as many founders and Viennese personalities have described it, Austria’s laws on “Eigenbedarf” thought they’ll shake up things even more for him. He had to leave his apartment, and having nothing holding him back in Vienna, he decided to embrace that new state of freedom and buy a one-way ticket to Bali, see where life took him. “Not having an anchor holding me down, also psychologically, set me off on the right path. It was like a chain effect. Amor Fati, Love Your Fate. Nothing that isn’t positive can happen to me. It felt like the world was telling me something. Comfort is a privilege but also a hindrance from necessity. A lot of big moves that have a big effect on your life are partly made out of necessity, partly of lack of choice. It’s hard to understand your own needs and be impulsive about your life if there’s no push. Where do you jump to if there’s no edge?” Your Vibe Attracts Your Tribe. Bali was the perfect edge to jump off to. Tiago found himself in the right environment for his creativity to thrive. It was there, when the idea of being a digital nomad struck his thoughts, and where the symbiosis made another full circle of magic. “I feel super grateful for people who see my videos and want to get in touch in order to work with me.” Bali brought many positive surprises and set him off on another journey he had never imagined. While shooting for an Australian band, people approached him for an independent Netflix series We Speak Dance. His role as Lead Editor and Director of Photography brought him around the world behind the scenes of a dance community advocating for social change. Jumping into the unknown really paid off his career in the long-term. Fast Forward >> Be kind. Always. Being able to do what he loves and being recognized for his work, is all he could ask for. Despite his big achievements and lots of famous names in his résumé, Tiago remained kind and down-to-earth. He is the perfect example that studies don’t dictate your future, but your choice and willingness to pursue them do. “It’s all about the experience, really. Understand what is blocking you. Make a choice and go for it. Be oblivious to people and thoughts that hold you back.” Adjusting your social life according to your spontaneous work schedule is another learning that one has to be ready for as well as experimenting with trial and error and iterating. “Have a rough mission statement and think about your core value proposition to other people. What exactly are you offering them?” A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. Learning and enjoying the process along the way is as important as having a healthy relationship with your finances and monitoring your thoughts and progress at the end of the day. Sometimes, it also helps to get a part-time job to cover your fixed costs and work on your passion until it takes off. “Don’t sell yourself short, take it extremely seriously, and know your worth. Let people see your value. Be empathetic and never lose your drive. At the end of the day, your work speaks for itself.” – End of Season One.

Being an entrepreneur means learning numerous things every day – it’s like going to the gym: sometimes painful but simultaneously making you feel alive” Entrepreneurship makes you feel alive Entrepreneurship was a start into a healthier, happier and more balanced lifestyle for Petra Boteková. She is a former manager and now successful entrepreneur, who founded the company ReloPilot, which simplifies international recruitment. Even though she now works more than ever, she experienced that “Entrepreneurship makes you feel alive because you are doing something you truly stand for. You can make important decisions yourself, work according to your personal preferences and create your company by your own values. What is more, you are contributing to something you believe is going to make the world a better place – that’s what drives us.“ There are a thousand things you have to learn for your startup – on top of that, you have to grow yourself Of course, the path to getting one’s idea off the ground is not always as easy as it seems. “There are a thousand things you have to learn for your startup and on top of that, you have to grow yourself“ – meaning you not only have to acquire a broad range of business-related skills but also work on self-development in order to be capable of dealing with arising issues. Petra compares building a company with going to the gym. Growing muscles is not easy and there will be painful times for sure, but in the end, pursuing your passion is worth it. For this reason maintaining one’s work-life balance is crucial. Petra found meditating a couple of minutes every day highly relaxing and helpful to cope with uncertainty and stress. By cherishing the little things and focusing on loving the journey instead of the end goals, she aims to enjoy her life to the fullest. Apart from that, setting boundaries between life and work is tremendously important. Petra therefore decided not to do anything work related on Saturdays in order to recharge her energy and remain healthy and motivated to grow her company. Almost everything can be learned online Anything can be learned – whether that’s analytics, people’s skills or public speaking. Petra experienced an extremely high learning curve through creating her own YouTube-Channel BoundaryLess. Both marketing and people skills are crucial to be successful eventually. YouTube helped her to acquire these skills fast. Also, the broad variety of online courses enables everyone to learn any skill nowadays. As for all learning processes, Petra stresses that it is essential to take the initiative and get started – instead of blaming unchangeable factors which are only prohibiting you from moving on and actually solving problems. Look beyond your own borders and challenge yourself every day Petra’s vision of looking beyond borders means much more than just physical borders. It means trying out things, empowering oneself and conquering new challenges. For actually getting started, Petra experienced that a mentor whom you really trust and to whom you are able to talk to about all your business related ideas proved to be invaluable. She explains that “Even if you are young and might feel that you are not experienced enough, you can be a driver of innovation and live your vision. You can indeed always find a more experienced co-founder. Being an entrepreneur also means learning numerous relevant working skills which will eventually help you in every single area of your life.“ Through building her startup, Petra experienced that clarity comes from action and that just going for it is the best way. In the end, being able to grow is the ultimate goal and will eventually lead to success!

Reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey, he is a strong believer of thinking broadly and finding out what exactly is important to oneself and what issues have to be solved in our world. “Don’t start a startup just for the sake of starting a startup,“ Philipp advises young aspiring entrepreneurs. It is therefore important to regard one’s reality with an open mind initially. After discovering your own area of passion, getting to know as many people as possible and reading a lot will help to get your ideas off the ground. Additionally, the value of a mentor should not be underestimated when deciding to build a startup, as receiving proactive feedback from an “outside observer“ might prove to be enormously beneficial. Always in sales mode Being honest and straightforward is the key habit for building a startup – this is what Philipp has learned throughout his own journey. Relying on open communication not only forms relationships which might prove to be invaluable, but also contributes to getting the most out of everyone involved in a startup. Thinking about his favorite failure, Philipp admits that he once did not unleash the potential of one of his employees. As a result, he realized the importance of aligning everyone’s tasks with their potential which has to be discovered through honest communication. Apart from that, as a founder, Philipp experienced that he always has to be in ‘Sales Mode’ – meaning that as an entrepreneur, you always have to sell yourself and your business at the same time. Consequently, in order to establish credibility, structured, straightforward and honest communication is essential. Improve everything but keep the positive core things in mind Being an entrepreneur also means being disciplined and being able to grow continuously. Both asking actively for feedback and being self-critical at all times is crucial while developing a new business. Philipp cannot stress the importance of testing enough. Indeed, testing everything is what Philipp would have focused on more, as one can then analyze the positive data points, stick to them and develop the business accordingly. “Change everything, improve everything but keep the positive core things in mind,“ is what Philipp would use as a guideline for establishing innovation. Do-to-say ratio Because of the importance of the do-to-say ratio, Philipp aims to improve the gap between plans and actions. Focusing on useful and relevant work and actively thinking what is actually achievable is an important step for every entrepreneur. In order to improve his do-to-say ratio, Philipp keeps a list of his pending priorities: instead of distracting oneself with meaningless work, doing the important tasks first is a crucial skill for every entrepreneur.

The co-founder and CEO of “Der Brutkasten”, Austria’s multimedia platform for startups, began his entrepreneurial journey with a side-project for his former employer “Die Presse”. Dejan was more than satisfied with his former employment and admitted he had never seen himself as an entrepreneur running his own company. However, overly propelled by the vision he saw in his project and the yearning for being part of this lively ecosystem of dedicated entrepreneurs, he would spent all his free time developing “Der Brutkasten”. Eventually, he acquired the project from “Die Presse” through a management buyout in 2017. The rest is history. Between Enthusiasm and Doubts Leaving a secure employment and a regular source of income was clearly not an easy decision in the beginning, especially, in the light of becoming a father amidst these life-changing circumstances. It took a decent amount of faith and optimism in order to decide to walk down this unprecedented path. When the doubts dispersed, the enthusiasm kicked in. “I just had to do it!”, the CEO assertively said, “That does not mean that doubts would disappear, however. You just learn to have trust.” The Rollercoaster The period after the foundation was marked by numerous “learnings”. With a cash runway of about two weeks, the company was constantly in survival mode. If the corona crisis had happened during that time, the consequences would have been quite fatal for the company’s trajectory. Did the “survival mode” enhance the performance? “Being with the back to the wall can motivate you tremendously,”, he said, “but it can also hamper your creativity and innovation.” That being said, it did propel him and his team to work harder and they managed to overcome these difficult times. Yet, new learnings keep emerging still. He intentionally calls them “learnings” instead of “difficulties” or “failures” because he is convinced that is what they are. They are supposed to happen for you to develop yourself and the company. It is a constant up and down that lets you appreciate the ride. God Is Love… …would be Dejan’s chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s trademark, the Stephansdom. With the help of his faith and belief, he knows when to listen to his intuition and when to analyze the situation rationally. To my question: “What tip would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs?”, he emphasized the importance of having a fervent passion inside, something you are truly convinced of. Once you have that, however, “Be rational about it. Ask yourself if you are actually solving a problem with your business idea. Exchange your thoughts and views with people that support you in your analysis. Find the balance between the heart and the mind.” Next week: Philipp Stangl, Rebel Meat In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

I believe that art is like a global language, which connects everyone, regardless of your religion, your language, your age or ethical background.” “Music has always been a part of my live” One of the reasons, why little big art is such an authentic organization, is that Frank himself is a musician through and through. His musical journey started at a boys’ choir, where he became a soloist singing opera on many different stages, from Israel to the US. At the age of 16, he got into deejaying, where he realised that it is possible to build a career around his passion music. “You have to swallow a lot of shit. That’s why persistence and stubbornness is a skill you need as an entrepreneur.” Frank’s time at the boys’ choir, where he constantly had to adapt to new situations and countries, laid the basis for his later success in the world of entrepreneurship. As a founder, you need to be adaptive and very flexible to survive in a world of uncertainty and constant change. Another skill Frank developed even further during his time as an entrepreneur is endurance and persistence. “Starting your own startup, you have to be persistent and stubborn, because you have to swallow a lot of shit. Further, you should not be afraid of those setbacks that you have throughout the time. Always be persistent and believe in the vision.” Especially in difficult times, a clear vision for yourself and your team is what keeps you going. “We believe that art is like a global language, which connects everyone, regardless of your religion, your language, your age or ethical background” Frank’s mission is to bring people together through art and also create value with his work. Everyone throughout the world should be able to experience intimate concerts and art experiences no matter where they are. “With the current Corona situation, all our live experiences were gone at once” Especially the art industry was affected by the Corona crisis. The whole platform and business model from Little Big Art were built upon live art experiences. But with the current Corona situation, all of a sudden, all those live experiences were gone within one day and the platform was empty. Instead of being desperate about the crisis the team adapted to the situation and featured digital art experiences like live drawing sessions, live readings, live concerts. “Out of this crisis, there are a lot of new possibilities emerging especially for the cultural sector.” “I believe that in the future, there will be more mixed forms of art experiences. Like an online guitar session or lesson, live stream events that can be seen via virtual reality or augmented reality.” Frank points out that people of the western world get used to things we only knew from the Asian parts of the world like micro-payments for small and virtual services. In his opinion, the crisis has also positive side effects, like the willingness to pay or tip for digital events or the possibility to open up the audience of the artists to other markets. The former Freilich Open Arts and now Little Big Art platform shows that the flexibility and the adaptability to ever-changing circumstances is a key success factor for startups. Although the startup is working in one of the sectors that have been hit hardest by the crisis, they remain forward-thinking and see change as an opportunity and not a reason to fail.

"29","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-7-stefanie-bramboeck/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #7: Stefanie BRAMBÖCK"," Portrait Name: Stefanie Bramböck Current Position: CEO of discovering hands Austria Focused on: Social Entrepreneurship in Healthcare Recipe for Success: Think fast on your feet, improvise and adapt quickly “It’s amazing to be an entrepreneur. Of course there are difficulties, but for me the positive aspects outweigh the negative. I did not have a planned way into entrepreneurship, it just happened at the right time. I would definitely recommend to everyone to start their own business once in their life because it’s a new aspect of life. You get to know a new perspective, you learn. Everyone should start a little idea.” Stefanie Bramböck joined discovering hands Austria, a social impact company, in January. “I did not plan my way into entrepreneurship, it just happened at the right time.” Having worked in PR, marketing, and agencies before, the arrival of her son changed everything for her, as she was looking for more flexibility and a way to create greater impact. discovering hands – A Win-win Situation When she heard about discovering hands, “I knew exactly that this is what I wanted to do now, that this is the right time for me to go into social business and to become an entrepreneur.” discovering hands, originally founded by Frank Hoffmann from Germany, is a social business active in the early detection of breast cancer. Breast cancer affects one of eight women, and discovering hands trains blind and visually impaired women as Medical Tactile Examiners (MTE), as their elevated sense of touch helps discovering breast tumours early. discovering hands also trains women on how to conduct the monthly self examination at home, which can further help with the early detection of breast cancer. Changing Conditions and Stefanie’s Recipe for Success A couple of months into her role as CEO, the impact of the Coronavirus changed conditions for discovering hands Austria massively: As close contact and touch was required for the breast cancer examinations, the distancing rules were impossible to follow for discovering hands, and all in-person courses for self-examinations were suddenly cancelled. Also, the discussions with the Ministry of Health to approve Medical Tactile Examiners (MTEs) as a recognized profession were put on hold, as the Ministry of Health had to fully focus on the new evolving situation with the Coronavirus. Stefanie and her team decided to start a crowdfunding campaign, which was successful: “I’m a fan of crowdfunding for investment. In addition to the financial support, we gained increased attention and new cooperation partners with our campaign, such as the “Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen Österreichs.” The past couple of months have taught Stefanie a lot about leadership: “Leadership for me has two aspects – you have to set the path as a leader, come up with the plan on how we can reach our goals. But you also have to inspire people, bringing them along on the journey, and convincing them that the path we’ve chosen is the right one.“ The Power of Improvisation One aspect that prepared Stefanie for entrepreneurship was jazz: “I’m a jazz singer, and especially in jazz music you have to improvise. You play together with a lot of different people, and you create something new together that has never existed before”, explains Stefanie. “At the end, it comes down to the ability and the skill to listen. You have to adapt yourself, work with the music the other musicians create in the moment, do something with it and develop it.” Improvisation, which is common in jazz, can help in business, especially when structures are not fully clear yet, as in any startup, and when you have to adapt fast to changing conditions. She also draws parallels to jazz when it comes to collaboration: Musicians are used to playing together even though they may have never met before, they can be old or young, from different backgrounds and skill levels. With only a set of rules that everybody is familiar with and a goal in mind, something new is created. This skill to think fast on their feet, adapt and improvise helps her and other musicians in their daily lives in business. The Ups and Downs of Entrepreneurship When asked about what Stefanie likes most about entrepreneurship, she mentions the freedom “to find my own ways and solutions, to find my style or way of doing things.” Together with her team, she finds new approaches to best reach their goals, and has the flexibility to work from either her home or the office. Stefanie also enjoys getting to know new people and growing her network, although this has been more difficult in the past months due to Corona. Stefanie also tells us about facets of entrepreneurship that have been difficult for her. For instance, paperwork and bureaucracy – “I’m not used to it, because as an employee, you don’t have to do it.” Also, being the CEO can sometimes feel very lonely, as there’s not always a sparring partner around: “I have to take my decisions on my own sometimes, and I would love to talk more about the topics and the challenges with others, but as an entrepreneur, especially in a small enterprise, sometimes you’re very alone in your thinking.” Although Stefanie didn’t plan her journey into entrepreneurship, she “would definitely recommend to everyone to start their own business once in their life because it’s a new aspect of life. You get to know a new perspective, you learn. Everyone should start a little idea.” And especially when conditions change rapidly, we should improvise more. Just like in Jazz.

"30","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-8-christiane-holzinger/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #8: Christiane HOLZINGER","Name: Christiane Holzinger Entrepreneur: since 12 years Speciality: (digital) taxes & business planning for startups Recipe for success = [(Be focused + Be disciplined) x good network]^be authentic Personal life motto: Be fla-mazing “It’s the best time to create a new business because there will never be more support. Invest in your personal development. In the end, we can only rely on ourselves.” Inception. Having been raised in an entrepreneurial family, Christiane decided to jump into entrepreneurship herself and founded her own digital tax consultancy company. “I wanted to rely on my own ideas. What’s the worst that can happen? The worst is that I don’t succeed and I lose my personal savings.” She hired her first experts to do the marketing and organizational management of the company, so she could focus on her strengths and be out there acquiring clients and generating revenue. 12 years later, she runs two companies (360 Business Planner and StartUp Stars), is the National President of the Junior Chamber International and Junge Wirtschaft, and the Deputy Head of Carinthia’s Federal Economic Chamber. At the latter, she makes an impact giving feedback on how to improve the situation and the entrepreneurial spirit in Austria. Christiane’s main focus is digital tax consultancy – perfect for traveling since nothing gets lost, and on top, it’s environmental-friendly. Her passion for the world combined with her international experience come in very handy in all her roles. Deep learning, becoming an expert in her field, the right people around her, and very hard work, especially in the first years of establishing her business, was crucial to successfully establish herself in a man’s industry. Why Taxes Are Sexy. Let’s be honest: There’s no entrepreneurship without taxes. Everyone needs a good tax advisor. “Working with taxes is like solving a riddle. You have to find a solution, be smarter than the rest to find the right strategy, and it’s actually sexy when you save taxes. At least my clients tell me this”, Christiane laughs. Masters are made not born. It takes a long time to become an expert and Christiane worked in various positions to acquire the necessary skills and to see how different areas and tools such as accounting, payroll, and controlling interrelate. “If you know the whole strategy, and you know how to play the game, it is a very cool job.” What Is Success? Christiane loves what she does. In fact, she considers her employees family, and her pink office her living room. Therefore working feels more like a hobby: “Working with taxes came very naturally to me. It was easy to handle the questions and tasks when I first started.” Communication skills, persistence, and persuasiveness are essential when she works closely with (tax) authorities that have very strict plans and ideas. Due to her international experience and mindset, Christiane never regrets anything and lives by a daily routine. Her motto is “reaching 50% of a very high goal is better than reaching 100% of a very low goal.” When doing business, her employees, her team, living quality of her team, and communication with clients are the most important factors to her. All this combined gives her “the energy, the learnings, the good times, the laughter, and everything that comes with it when you are an entrepreneur.” Furthermore, Christiane draws her success mostly from the people she surrounds herself with: “Surround yourself with people who have the same spirit, mindset, and above all, the same values.” Be Authentic, Be Fla-mazing! Authenticity resonates with inner happiness, which results in good business. Inspired by a conversation in Florida, Christiane sees herself as a flamingo who is happy because of everything she absorbs, learns, and surrounds herself with, e.g. the positive working environments. Why? Flamingos turn to the color they absorb, eat, or see. That’s why they turn pink: “Be authentic. Look at the strengths you have and start from there. Focus. Don’t try to copy others. If you fail, and if you are a hard worker, you’ll reinvent yourself. However, be prepared to work harder than others in a male business as a female founder. Don’t overthink what the rules are in business and be yourself. I also thought: It’s my office, I’m my own boss – if I want to wear dresses and flip flops or be barefoot, I’ll just do it. If people don’t like it, I don’t care. It’s not about my dress code but about the results I deliver to my clients.” Observe The Market & Invest In Yourself. Christiane recommends the book “Non-obvious” by Rohid Bharghava, whom she met last year: “As an entrepreneur, no matter what you do, you should always observe what’s happening. Being flexible and adaptive is what we see right now, in this time, the most important skill for an entrepreneur.” Personally, she envisions the future as very positive despite some hard years ahead. “Human kind has always survived crises. Why shouldn’t we survive this crisis? Crisis is very important for innovation.” The time to change and adapt to our environment is now: “It’s the best time to create a new business because there will never be more support. Invest in your personal development. In the end, we can only rely on ourselves. Read a lot and structure your day. It doesn’t matter where you want to be in the future, just try to imagine how you will feel when you reach our goal.” Next week: Eugen Prosquill In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

"31","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-special-edition-hannah-wundsam/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #Special Edition: Hannah WUNDSAM","Portrait: Hannah Wundsam Position: CXO at AustrianStartups, Co-founder of rePhil Focus: Social Entrepreneurship Recipe for success: Be persistent “Entrepreneurs are people who develop projects and implement solutions to problems that concern their communities.” Passionate social entrepreneur; actively seeking to help people who want to make an impact; CXO at AustrianStartups and Co-founder of a startup – this is Hannah Wundsam. What primarily attracted her in entrepreneurship is that “you can create impact by implementing your own ideas.” Her vision? The cultivation of an entrepreneurial mindset among the Austrian youth via the educational system. Entrepreneurship and Authority For Hannah it all starts by creating a certain mindset – entrepreneurship is all about being solution-driven and not problem focused. This is the Alpha and Omega of the entrepreneur’s worldview, to perceive problems as opportunities. “The current school system provides binary frames for handling problems: you can either be right or wrong, and the answer depends on the judgement of an authority.” What needs to be done is to help people see the opportunities and master the skills they need to realize solutions. This is why Hannah’s next chapter within AustrianStartups will focus on fostering entrepreneurship in schools. Who is an entrepreneur? She holds a very inclusive understanding towards entrepreneurship – “It is not about tech-ies who want to be the next billionaires.” Entrepreneurs for her, are not only the founders of companies, but also people who develop projects and implement solutions to problems that concern their communities. Creating a legacy During her exchange semester in Australia, Hannah realized that she can link her Business studies to her impact-driven ideas, “to combine the impact world with the profit world.” Coming back to Vienna determined, she decided to take a deep dive in the field – Impact Hub; student centers for innovation; innovation agencies. Along these experiences rePhil was born, a circular system for take-away packaging – “You may not be able to be 100% sustainable but you can make sure that your own footprint is a positive one and thus, leave a positive legacy behind you.” Women and men entrepreneurs What are the differences between men and women entrepreneurs? According to Hannah you cannot really make clear distinctions – it’s not an issue of nature but rather of nurture. Gender as a natural category has not much to offer here. On the other hand, from her experience it is easier to find men than women entrepreneurs to fill a stage panel. It comes back to education: Girls should be more educated on the opportunities out there because there truly exists a mentality that wants to foster women entrepreneurship and leadership. “For women with ideas, this is the right time to step up!” Bring down existing obstacles! “The ecosystem is still relatively small and people are very eager to support and work with each other.” Though, Hannah believes that there are still barriers that need to be brought down for further development – the general mindset that you need money to found a company; the complicated system of services and organizations that leave people unaware of the opportunities out there; the scarcity of Venture Capital in Austria. The entrepreneurial toolkit Do you want to be an entrepreneur? Here is what Hannah considers as essentials: Learn how to present your ideas in front of a big crowd – nobody is good at pitching an idea from the very beginning but this is something you can definitely learn! Train yourself in motivating or inspiring others to believe in your idea. Be persistent – talk a lot about your ideas to others but always take feedback with a pinch of salt. Find ways to believe in your projects when others are skeptical and follow-up when for whatever reason people don’t get back to your requests for a meeting: “You will be surprised how far this can get you – that’s how we got our first pilot at rePhil.” Find a way to divide your time to different projects effectively. Though, don’t neglect to shut off and take breaks. Running outside or enjoying nature may be where you come up with your best ideas! Bonus tip: “Have people around that give and do not drag energy from you.” This is especially important when building a team. Always keep in mind… Don’t be shy to follow up. “Go out and talk about your idea, every opportunity is a pitch.” Take feedback with caution; everybody will tell you their own opinion but you will decide which of these you will integrate and which not. People think that someone who is older in the field gets everything right but this is not always the case – in the end “everyone cooks with water.” It is you who need to decide how you want your product or service to look like: be brave to make the decisions. “Follow your gut!” In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

"32","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-specialedition-3-most-valuable-skills/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs Of Austria #Special: The 3 most valuable skills for building a successful business","In our “Entrepreneurs of Austria” series, we’re interviewing entrepreneurs to learn more about their journey, experiences, and learnings. One of the questions we were especially curious about were the most valuable skills for building a successful business. Can these skills be learned, or are there even traits that entrepreneurs are “just born with”? How can we all make use of these skills to become more entrepreneurial in our daily lives? In the 15 interviews with the entrepreneurs of season 1, we’ve discovered patterns of valuable skills of entrepreneurs. They range from advice to trust the gut feeling to interpersonal communication and sales skills, self-adaptation, time management and planning in enough time for rest to reset and reflect. The 3 most valuable skills we’ve identified for building successful businesses: #3: Quickly Adapting to Changing Situations In entrepreneurship, no day is the same. Every day brings new and unexpected challenges, and things might be moving very quickly: From signing new customers on Monday to difficult calls and decision making on Tuesday, every day varies greatly, and is part of the emotional rollercoaster entrepreneurship is often compared to. Being comfortable to adapt quickly to changing situations and pivot where needed is one common topic that we’ve seen in our interviews, and prepare entrepreneurs to stay flexible and adapt in a world of uncertainty and constant change. #2: Courage Entrepreneurship can be difficult and scary. It’s walking an unbeaten path that nobody has ever taken before, and nobody knows its final destination. Courage is key in entrepreneurship. Going from a stable paycheck to exploring, learning, and building a company is a big decision: Entrepreneurship is risky. Taking the decision to venture into entrepreneurship requires courage, which was very often mentioned in our interviews and seems to be one common trait the entrepreneurs shared. #1: Persistence Persistence seems to be the number one skill to master in entrepreneurship. Even if one might be facing difficult times, having the grit to pull through, find a way out, analyze the situation and pivot is key for success. Isa Watson, a US-based founder, describes the feeling of Entrepreneurship in what we believe is a very accurate reflection: “Being an entrepreneur is just literally mastering how to stomach the feeling that things are falling apart and coming together all at the same time.” Persistence, or the unwillingness to give up in difficult times, can really make a difference to push a company ahead in their path towards success, and is a key skill our entrepreneurs have mentioned when building their businesses. Successful entrepreneurship seems to align around these 3 key skills – quickly adapting to changing situations, courage and persistence. Do you agree? What do you think should have made the list?

"33","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-specialedition-top-5-reasons-why/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs Of Austria #Special: Top 5 Reasons “Why”","Why Did They Become Entrepreneurs? In the course of our interview series since the initiation in May, we were able to make out some interesting commonalities between the interviewed entrepreneurs. They often resemble in various aspects – from their why’s to their circumstances of their inception. This blog post covers the top 5 reason why our already 12 interviewees chose the entrepreneurial path. #1 – Doing It Your Own Way The reason that almost everyone shares is that for entrepreneurs typical “Do It Yourself” – approach. Phrases like, “I like to be my own boss and make important decisions myself”, were repeated quite frequently. We were not overly surprised by that, since for founding your own company and introducing your own product or service to the market you have to rely on yourself. As every startup or entrepreneurial foundation is different, there is no exact instruction manual given. Of course, you can learn from existing professionals in your field acquire all the tips and advices for certain situations; however, when it has to get down, you have to be self-reliant and proactive. Traits that are absolute musts for every entrepreneur. #2 – Follow Your Calling Whether they named it calling, passion or purpose what most of our interviewed entrepreneurs have in common is their underlying enthusiasm for a greater cause. Some even mentioned words like, “meant to do it”, when we asked how they overcame their doubts of starting out. We believe that inner certainty that things will work out is crucial for getting past the first few hurdles that will be set in your way. #3 – Solve a Problem Often our entrepreneurs discovered room for improvements in certain industries that have to be addressed. Whether it was Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger of Erdbeerwoche, Rebekka Dober of YEP or Philipp Stangl of Rebelmeat, just to name a few, they all wanted to innovate or develop a product and, hence, contribute to society. They realized it was not about them but rather about the problem they wanted to solve. Still knowing the problem is one thing, actually coming up with the solution and acting on it is a whole different conversation! #4 – Do It Out of Joy “I want to create cool things and in order to do that I need to develop as a person”, Eugen Warda of Wardanetwork said, for instance. Having joy for the work you do as the impetus for improvement is key. Similar to “follow your passion”, if you stand for an idea or find the thing that excited you and make it your job, you will never have to work a day in your life again. Sounds cliché, but it’s true. In the initiation phase you have to put the work in and unless you’re not one hundred percent behind your project, you will lose enthusiasm and quit. As opposed to this, if you love what you do, you forget to count the hours and end up burning the candle at both ends until the job is done. #5 – Don’t Do It for the Money Do it wholeheartedly and with love to the detail and the money will, eventually, follow! What every entrepreneur agreed with is that money shouldn’t be your number one drive. Choosing the quick paycheck over the project and outcome that you really desire might be appealing in the short run, but in the long run it will let you neglect and forget the reason you wanted to become an entrepreneur in the first place. Paradoxically, by not putting such importance on the return but focusing on your idea, your product or service, you will do your work with diligence which again benefits the quality of your product or service. The better those become, the higher the demand will be there for your work! In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

Today, we are launching a new project: portraying Entrepreneurs of Austria. Have you ever had a dream, a vision, an idea and were unsure or afraid to unfold it? By “sketching” portraits of Austrian Entrepreneurs, we want to inspire pupils, students, enthusiasts, aspiring and established entrepreneurs, and everyone alike, to take a leap of faith. We want them to unleash the most entrepreneurial version of themselves. The portraits will provide a glimpse into the minds of Entrepreneurs in Austria, their lives, their unique experiences, successes, painful detours as well as advice to others. Reading them shall evoke passion, inspiration and courage to every one of us in order to pursue similar dreams – hopefully these brief stories will foster an entrepreneurial mentality to more people in Austria.

"35","https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #9: Eugen PROSQUILL","Portrait Name: Eugen Prosquill Current Position: Founder and CEO of Warda Network Personal Mission: Innovating the marketing industry by defining trends Recipe for Success: Do you at all times – people respect authenticity From a School Project to 20 Employees It all started when Eugen was assigned to come up with a final project as part of his school education. While everyone else programmed devices like stopwatches or calculators, the future CEO of Warda Network thought of creating something more lasting. An event photography website was the result. “I wanted to save some money when going out,” he stated bluntly. The time he spent on his project during school inevitably affected his grades. Whether that was good or bad, he could not tell. He just knew that he had to walk a different path, which, to the concern of his mother, forced him to drop out. However, what school did not recognize was his creative ability and marketing understanding. Soon he was introduced to like-minded people and after one thing led to another the core of his agency was born. “A lot has happened since then,” the now 31-year old “Chief of Everything”, as he titles himself, says nostalgically, “but to be honest, we should have done more.” Half a decade ago, Warda transitioned to Warda Network, a creative marketing agency that is known for breaking conventions. If You Don’t Expect You Can Make It, You Won’t Compared to his 18-year old self, Eugen operates way more strategically these days; however, always by being authentic to his core principle: Enjoy what you do. Eugen’s mentality consists of a blend between an inner curiosity for new creations and an unwavering self-esteem. It is his job to come up with ideas and he does not shy away from executing them. Trust is key. “Trust people, trust business opportunities. Skepticism and second-guessing don’t get you ahead,” he adds. You Have to Face the Bad In Order to Know the Good Eugen has never attended a university lecture; however, he acknowledges the importance of learning. Instead of locking himself inside libraries and delving into theoretical literature, he considers life as the greatest teacher and failure as his greatest lessons. Commenting on the obstacles he faced in the business world, he said, “You have to get to know bad people, in order to find out who the good ones are – sometimes it takes certain failures to recognize and appreciate times without hurdles and hassles.” Motivated by Joy Already 13 years in the industry, and still with the same hunger as when he has started out. How? Eugen’s kind of motivation comes intrinsically, “I want to create cool things and in order to do that I need to develop as a person. Of course, there are different phases. Sometimes you just want to prove something to yourself. At other times you have different priorities.” Even though the CEO does not cherish stagnancy, he emphasized the importance of pauses, especially in the creative sector. He seldomly feels pressure on his ability to come up with ideas because he is convinced that he can rely on his team. Still he does not deny his responsibility as a CEO. “Being an entrepreneur is not always as fun as it might seem. You are a trendsetter, a leader that has to stand his ground, a mentor, sometimes even a psychologist to your colleagues.” On the other hand, he praises that his job does not exactly feel like one. His friends would see him on Instagram and would not understand that he is actually working. Work-life balance? Is no issue, as he can design his week to his liking; thus, rarely missing out on family time. His brain always works, though. “Last week I was on vacation with a couple of friends, and we invented a board game. We are currently pondering on whether we want to launch it commercially or just produce 100 pieces for ourselves.” Madness Meets Genius … are his chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s Stephansdom. Any background picture for it? A photograph of the entire team. “That pretty much sums up what the company stands for,” he comments. To my question whether he is concerned that other people might regard some of his ideas as too risky, he merely answered, “What we do at Warda makes sense and if it is necessary to be crazy or mad, then, that is exactly what we have to go for.” Eugen does believe in destiny which endows him with a sort of serenity when it comes to his decision making, “You cannot always control everything.” His final advice for aspiring entrepreneurs would be, “Don’t do it for the money. If you do it out of joy and it’s the right idea, the money will follow, eventually”.","July 6th, 2020","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eugen-Quadrat-300x300.png"

This month’s Stammtisch was all about celebrating the past and thinking of the future. written by Nicolas Kristen First of all, if you couldn’t make it to this month’s Stammtisch but want to re-watch the whole thing click here – we had a livestream! Now, let’s get to recapping. AustrianStartups held its 50th Stammtisch and as some of you may remember, things have changed a lot since the first Stammtisch where people were still sitting around an actual table. This would not have been possible without our supporters. So thank you all! How to build the Future: The Austrian Startup Agenda So how’s the future of the Austrian Startup ecosystem going to look? Well nobody can see into the future but one can definitely try to change it. So after three months in development, working with 50 experts, we’re ready to announce the Austrian Startup Agenda. Why you ask? If you’ve ever founded your own startup, you will probably agree that it can be quite challenging at times. And while we believe that overcoming these challenges is vital for developing as an entrepreneur, we also believe that there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to regulations, research, funding and education. And improving these areas will be vital if the Austrian Startup community wants to compete on a global market in the future. Over the course of these three months we settled on 36 recommendations divided into six areas we believe need change to ensure a competitive Austrian Startup ecosystem: Education and research, legal conditions for entrepreneurship in Austria, private risk capital, public funding, Austria’s international positioning and the relationship between political institutions and entrepreneurs in Austria. So that’s where you, yes YOU, come into play. Because we need your feedback to further prioritize what’s important for Austrian entrepreneurs. And that’s what Stammtisch #50 was all about: Getting your feedback and exchanging ideas. If you didn’t attend the Stammtisch we highly recommend you read up on our Agenda here and vote on the five demands you think are the most important for the future of startups in Austria. So do the right thing and help us improve Austria for future entrepreneurs and maybe even change the world a little bit. Like our CEO Markus said: “Every one of you here can change the world within the next few months”. So get to it and see you at the next Stammtisch!","September 29th, 2017","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21686896_10155856057592033_8013359824579460695_o-300x200.jpg"
"37","https://austrianstartups.com/farewell-vlad-welcome-katharina/","AustrianStartups","Farewell Vlad & Welcome Katharina","I’m not gonna lie – when putting up my first post in the private AustrianStartups Facebook group in late 2012, I had no idea where this community initiative would end up. And frankly, I still don’t ? But that’s a good thing! Because AustrianStartups has and always will be what the startup ecosystem at a certain point in time needs it to be ? Let me back up for a minute and fill you in on our short but eventful history. See, back in 2012 I had joined forces with Markus Wagner at i5invest, when it was still a startup factory, and in a flash, the whole startup ecosystem opened up right before me. Though calling it ecosystem seems now out of place when thinking of the scene’s infancy. You see, startups were still a relatively rare breed, mingling on pretty much the same grounds. It was around that time that I got to know RealLife Connect, a young Viennese startup who’s co-founder Jürgen was running this Facebook page coined AustrianStartups. He started it as an open space for exchange among entrepreneurs and had grown it well into over a hundred followers. Back then he was leading the charge on expanding his business overseas and, while he didn’t have time to run it, he also didn’t want to let his side project fade away. So in a fit of youthful naiveté I rose to the challenge, got an admin role and started to play around with the community in a grassroots fashion. ? I started by connecting with other local up-and-coming communities like Pioneers and TEDxVienna, while posting startup relevant stories from and about founders. While the community and interaction within grew, I soon found others who shared the passion of bringing startupers together to learn from each other, and Can, Daniel, Adiam, Patrick and Christoph emerged as the most devoted partners I could’ve wished for ? Soon we hacked together the Start VIE interactive map on austrianstartups.com with the first searchable crowdsourced startup database for Austria and started hosting regular informal meetups we later called Stammtisch. AustrianStartups had quickly become more than a digital community. It was the common voice of a scene, a physical space of confluence and a repository of knowledge & ressources. ? Something that didn’t belong to anyone in particular, but to all simultaneously. A common good of sorts. So we formalized it as such, forming a non-partisan, non-profit initiative by, for, and of the Austrian startup community with the aim to increase its visibility and strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Once set into motion, AustrianStartups proved a force to be reckoned with: sporadic gatherings turned into regular monthly Stammtisch events, the crowdsourced database served as groundwork for mapping the whole Austrian startup ecosystem and aggregating & coordinating information set the foundation for publications such as Visions for Startups in Austria (2013), The Startup Agenda (2017) and The Austrian Startup Monitor (2018). As the startup environment in Austria changed over the last years, AustrianStartups did so as well, simultaneously influencing that transition and adjusting to it, to better cater for newly arising needs. Perhaps this is best reflected in the constant flux of talented and dedicated people ?<U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>?<U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> involved at all ranks – from volunteer helpers to operative management and finally to its board, which I have been a part of ever since signing the organization into existence. So I’ve been privileged enough to see a generational change and the extremely positive impact it could have on the evolution of the non-profit. With the very skilled Markus following in Christoph’s footsteps at the helm and visionary individuals like Maggie and Daniel enriching the board, I’ve witnessed first hand the transformational power of maintaining a constant influx of new people in all layers of AustrianStartups. Today, the vision of this organization is clearer than blue skies over Alpine slopes as it aims to make entrepreneurship as commonplace in Austria as skiing is. <U+26F7><U+FE0F> And while over the last 6 years I have left my mark on AustrianStartups as much as it has on me, the best way to support its current vision and assure its continued growth is to clear the path for the next generation. So I’m extremely proud to announce that I have found an incredibly talented, intelligent and motivated successor in fellow startup founder Katharina Unger, to whom I’m entrusting my board seat, effective immediately. But as I can’t really stop applying myself, I tend to stick around. Therefore I will be joining the AustrianStartups Advisory Board alongside many of the startup ecosystem elders, continuously supporting with bits of wisdom from the sidelines. Change is the only constant and talking about the future of the ecosystem is definitely a tense conversation (pun intended), but certainly also one that involves AustrianStartups. <U+2728> Vlad Gozman When I left Austria, there were two things that were quite definitely not on my list: founding a startup and coming back to Austria anytime soon. When I did end up founding a startup only 2 years later, in Hong Kong, Austria was still not on the map for me and my concerns couldn´t be more prejudiced against my own home country. “Notary public? Too much hassle” I thought. Some superficial research into the bureaucracy of raising grant fundings or setting up employee stock options confirmed my bias: we felt we had no time for an Austrian “between a melange and the spritzer kind of” pace of doing things. We had a few months between building an MVP, founding a company, raising funds, building a team and launching our first Kickstarter campaign. And we were convinced this was only possible in two places: the US and China. But then I had a change of mind: In 2016, on a trip back home, I stumbled into an AustrianStartups Stammtisch in Sektor5. Wait what? International vibes, energy, cool people – something good was going on here! AustrianStartups came across as young and spirited but also professional and trustworthy. I had known similar organizations on government level from Hong Kong or Singapore but an independent group standing in for national startup matters, represented not by the government but by the ecosystem itself is a truckload more power behind the wheel. I was impressed! Another 3 years later, I am humbled to be invited onto the board of this cool gang. Since our startup is, as of not too long ago, not only a Hong Kong but also an Austrian Startup, I am now sharing the mission with AustrianStartups to build a better ecosystem for everyone. And let me be clear: many of my prejudices in founding a startup in Austria later proved to be wrong or at least not as annoying or difficult as imagined in the first place. But we definitely have a lot more work ahead to make it accessible and easier for everyone! The topics where I hope to contribute value as a sparring partner in my time on the board are particularly: International Matters (particularly Asia) and Hardware. I have lived abroad for a long time (US+Asia) and still splitting my time between Asia and Europe. In our startup, we have bootstrapped our way from prototyping to manufacturing in Hong Kong and China. Of course, I am also happy to share my experiences as a female founder and public speaker. One of the topics close to my heart are the creative industries: as an industrial designer myself, I know how challenging it is as a creative professional to dare the jump to become larger than a one (wo-)man show. We could do better to help creatives to start-up and also make better use of creative skill sets in startups in general. The other topic is agritech/food startups: this sector is growing worldwide with more venture capital flowing into alternatives to meat, improvement of crops and digitalization in agriculture. Austria has a variety of landscapes and climates and a very open-minded and sustainability-oriented audience when it comes to food and agriculture. It therefore offers good prerequisites for prototyping and testing agtech. We have a lot to do. Wherever we can though, we should together use Austria´s benefits to inspire more diversity, more fearless super(wo-)man action and more optimism! Let´s do this, Austrian Startups ?

So here is what you should consider when looking for an investor. This time we were joined by Tobias Homberger CEO, myclubs, who as a lone founder guided his company through currently 4 rounds of investment and growth. Joined by Lisa-Marie Fassl managing director, Austrian Angel Investors Association (AAIA), a role which focuses on finding the right match between startup and investor. And finally, Oliver Holle founder and CEO, Speedinvest, bringing not just years of international experience to the discussion but a holistic approach having being on both sides of the bargaining table. Your first investment doesn’t need to be an investor. No, we’re not going to tell you to get in touch with family or friends – the infamous uncle’s investment – but you shouldn’t overlook government support. Make use of the big selection of public grants for startups – after all the state doesn’t take equity! Austria is one of the only governments to offer this – use it! Pitch your startup as much as you can. Building a network is how you will most likely find the right investor. Don’t take the money right away. Austria offers many opportunities to gain exposure before investment and it’s something the AAIA is looking for. There’s Pioneers, WeXelerate and Talent Garden. Going to these pitching events and contacting public grant institutions are good moves even if it is 6 months before you need investment. Getting the idea out there and stimulating interest is important. Avoid the less well known pitfall of incorrect share distribution. What is a red flag for investors? If at Seed Stage there are already clear problems with equity, often due to many non-operational shareholders, chances of further investment are slim if not impossible. Each investment builds on the previous one and the next investor will ask for more equity. The Startup will become non-fundable at some point as the return needed from equity will never be seen. In other words, don’t give 40% to a family member who lent you some office space for 3 months’ – it’s happened before. What not to look for in an investor. While a friendly and supportive investor might boost your confidence, it’s not going to help you when it comes to further developing your product. An investor shouldn’t be nice, they should be critical and challenge what you’re doing. Smart money vs dumb money Always consider what an investor can do for your startup besides the money. While some investors can provide you with a useful network or experience, others might cause internal problems like having an entirely different vision for your startup down the line. What social network is best to reach investors? In a nutshell – NONE, personal contact is important. If you want to contact investors, going on their actual website is one of the best ways to make the initial contact if you don’t have anybody in your network. The AAIA also promotes investors and their main function is to help with matching investors and startups – again their website is your best option. Don’t believe you made it just because you scored an angel investor. A common mistake. The first investment is really just the first battle. As investments increase more people will be interested and subsequently involved. Making sure that a return of over 100% on the initial investment can be achieved is hard work. Raising follow-on financing from initial investors, finding other investors to bring into the venture and maintaining quality and the brand are key. In summary: A good network is important when finding the right investor. Focus on building the network, getting exposure and understanding exactly what you need the investment for in the short term, investment is done in stages for a reason. See you at the next Stammtisch!","May 19th, 2017","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Optimized-579T1477-300x200.jpg"

Fifteen Seconds versteht sich als Plattform im Spannungsfeld zwischen Wirtschaft, Innovation und Kreativität und veranstaltet neben einem jährlichen Festival auch seine eigene Youtube Show, produziert Podcasts und bietet innovative Workshops und Retreats für Einzelpersonen und Unternehmen an. „Bei uns ist jeder willkommen, der die Welt verbessern möchte“, sagt Stefan, egal ob beruflich, persönlich oder gesellschaftlich. Und die Betonung liegt auf jeder, denn Fifteen Seconds zeigt sich stolz als interdisziplinäres Format. Leidenschaft und Neugierde der Teilnehmer:innen seien das, was im Vordergrund steht; nicht Alter, Berufswahl oder Aussehen. Fifteen Seconds‘ Veranstaltungen sind daher von Natur aus inklusiv gestaltet und dennoch von einem gewissen Hauch an Exklusivität geprägt, der schwer nachzuahmen ist. „Wir haben ja de facto nicht das Rad erfunden, wir haben es nur neu designed“ – mit einer unglaublichen Liebe zum Detail soll Fifteen Seconds Erlebnisse schaffen, die es Besucher:innen ermöglichen abzuschalten, in neue Welten einzutauchen und sich inspirieren zu lassen. Graz > Wien Der Erfolg dieses Konzeptes ist für Stefan etwas, das sich Co-Founder Thiemo und er hart erkämpfen mussten, aber auch etwas das überwiegend auf die Authentizität und die Leidenschaft zurückzuführen ist, die das gesamte Team an den Tag legt. Es sei v.a. wichtig sich selbst treu zu bleiben, sein Ding durchzuziehen und die eigene Persönlichkeit in das was man tut mit einzubringen. Daher bleibt Graz auch weiterhin Hauptbühne des Fifteen Seconds Festivals und darum ruft Stefan auch mal hunderte Gäste persönlich an, wenn es um Pandemie-bedingte Ticketrückerstattungen geht. Und dann kam COVID Gerade als das Unternehmen drauf und dran war sein wirtschaftlich erfolgreichstes Geschäftsjahr hinzulegen, begann unglücklicherweise eine mysteriöse Lungenkrankheit aus Wuhan die ganze Welt heimzusuchen. Für Stefan und sein Team war daher recht schnell klar, dass ihre Events im Jahr 2020 nicht mehr stattfinden könnten. Für ein aufstrebendes Unternehmen ein absolutes Horrorszenario. Und dennoch, trotz aller Belastungen des vergangenen Jahres, kommt man beim Zuhören nicht umhin, Stefans lösungsorientierte, machen-statt-jammern Einstellung zu bemerken: „Für mich hat am Ende des Tages, wenn man das sagen darf, COVID, unter Anführungszeichen, auch etwas Positives gehabt. Wenn man anfängt Dinge  zu hinterfragen und grundsätzlich ein positiver und leidenschaftlicher und arbeitswilliger Mensch ist, dann kann man ja aus den schlimmsten Situationen heraus auch wahnsinnig Positives spinnen und ein Unternehmen weiterentwickeln.“ Bis uns schlechte Internetverbindungen nicht mehr scheiden Zeitgemäße Events zu veranstalten, bedeute für den Augenblick die aufzubrechen und an unterschiedlichen Locations (bestmöglich Openair) stattfinden zu lassen. Für die Zukunft aber sagt Stefan voraus, dass wir durchaus wieder zu physischen Veranstaltungen zurückkehren werden – bestimmte Dinge könne man einfach nicht über Webcams vermitteln. Trotzdem werde auch ein gewisser Anteil unserer digitalen Ansätze erhalten bleiben, v.a. wenn es darum geht vermehrt auf Nachhaltigkeit zu setzen. „Ich versuche mit Fifteen Seconds und auch privat und mit der Familie , dass sich die Welt ein Stück weit in ihrem gesellschaftlichen Miteinander wieder zu einem besseren Ort entwickelt. Zu einem Ort, in dem man sich wieder mehr wertschätzt, in dem man respektvoller miteinander umgeht, in dem Wirtschaft wieder ein Stück weit nach hinten rückt und die Personen in den Vordergrund rücken. Und man sich mehr über Dinge Gedanken macht  die dann auch den Generationen nach uns  eine gute Welt ermöglicht.“ Autorin: Lena Silberbauer","April 29th, 2021","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/future_weekly-300x164.png"

Wie wir allerdings aus der letzten Podcastfolge und dem Durchforsten der Standard Kommentare nach dem „Keyboard Warrior of the Week“ wissen, ist vielen in der Allgemeinbevölkerung aber noch nicht ganz klar, was der Begriff Startup genau bedeutet und was ein Job in diesem Feld überhaupt mit sich bringt. Wir seien aber auf dem besten Weg, meint Gabi: „Ziel wäre natürlich, dass wir uns überflüssig machen , aber solang das nicht der Fall ist können wir gemeinsam noch daran arbeiten.“ Vienna Calling Und das tut die Wirtschaftsagentur Wien, indem sie das nationale Bewusstsein für Startups und den internationalen Bekanntheitsgrad Wiens als Startup Hub zu fördert. Gabi beschreibt unsere Hauptstadt als einen „Hidden Champion“ bzw. „Rising Star“ unter den Starting Up Standorten. Das Startup Ökosystem in Österreich wachse und gedeihe immer weiter, auch weil Wien viele attraktive Rahmenbindungen vorweisen könne: einen hohen Professionalisierungsgrad zum Beispiel, sowie sprachliches, kulturelles und v.a. leistbares Knowhow und insbesondere auch eine ausgezeichnete Lebensqualität. Das Einzige, das Wien damit noch fehlt wäre ein Sandstrand, aber auch hier stellt Gabis Meinung nach die Donauinsel eine würdige Alternative dar. Klingt ziemlich idyllisch, oder? Nun, natürlich weiß auch unser Podcast Gast, dass es durchaus noch Bereiche gibt, wo man Verbesserungen vorantreiben müsse – allen voran die in Österreich und Europa relativ überschaubare Finanzierungslandschaft. Zusätzlich stünde auch die gute alte Bürokratie im Inland Startups immer wieder im Weg, speziell wenn es um die österreichische Rechtsform, Arbeitsbewilligungen für Drittstaatsangehörige und Möglichkeiten zur Mitarbeiterbeteiligung geht. Digitaler Humanismus Nichtsdestotrotz glaubt Gabi fest an das Potenzial Wiens als Lebensraum und als Wirtschaftsstandort. Von Smart City, Green Tech und Life Science, bis hin zur Kreativwirtschaft beherbergt die Bundeshauptstadt ein sehr breites Spektrum an Themenbereichen und Branchen. Gabi fasst diese unter dem Begriff „Digitaler Humanismus“ zusammen, denn der Mensch und die Umwelt stünden immer mehr im Fokus zahlreicher in Österreich gegründeter Startups. Die dahingehende Diversität unseres Standortes betrachtet Gabi als einen Vorteil. Die Vergangenheit habe bereits gezeigt, dass Wien eine Stadt ist, in der verrückte Ideen aus allen möglichen Bereichen zu etwas Großartigem heranwachsen können. Es gelte aber Menschen verstärkt auf innovative Projekte aufmerksam zu machen und Vorbildfunktion zu schaffen: „Eigentlich müsste man alle Straßen der Stadt Wien tapezieren mit diesen tollen Ideen, was die Unternehmer da alles auf den Boden bringen und sich neues einfallen lassen“. Crazy to Grand – ViennaUP‘21 Einen ersten Einblick in die Vielfalt der Ideen und Startups, die Österreich und Wien zu bieten haben, möchten Gabi und die Wirtschaftsagentur durch die ViennaUP’21 bereitstellen. Der Online Startup Gipfel soll dabei mit mehr als 40 Programmpartner:innen und unterschiedlichsten Veranstaltungsformaten sowohl Teilnehmende aus dem In- und Ausland, wie auch Studierende bis hin zu Investoren ansprechen, abholen und für Wien als Startup Hub begeistern. Das Festival soll aber auch Startups selbst eine Plattform bieten, um gegenseitigen Austausch zu ermöglichen und Synergieeffekte zu schaffen. Was bringt die Zukunft? Gabi sieht der Zukunft Wiens als Startup Hotspot positiv entgegen. Über die Coronakrise hinweg habe sie bereits gebannt beobachtet, mit welcher Agilität und Kreativität Startups sich mit der Pandemie auseinandergesetzt, sich neu aufgestellt und sogar neue Geschäftsmodelle für sich entwickelt haben. Zukünftig sei es darüber hinaus besonders wichtig, nachhaltige und soziale Fragen schon von Anfang an bei der Unternehmensgründung zu berücksichtigen: „Gegen COVID können wir uns impfen lassen, gegen den Klimawandel nicht“. Für die Zukunft wünscht sich Gabi daher ein smartes, nachhaltiges, CO2-freies Wien – ein schöner Moonshot, wie auch Daniel und Markus finden, und wohlgemerkt sogar realistisch.

"41","https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-90-deep-dive-hypergrowth-mit-felix-ohswald/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly #90 | Deep Dive: Hypergrowth mit Felix Ohswald","Founder of GoStudent – We are hiring! Mitgründer und CEO von GoStudent, Felix Ohswald, hat schon früh sein unternehmerisches Talent entdeckt. Als etwa 10-Jähriger habe er zum Beispiel begonnen, ausgeborgte DVDs zu brennen und weiterzuverkaufen, um sich damit seine Hobbies zu finanzieren. Mittlerweile stellt Felix keine illegalen Raubkopien mehr her, aber die Entrepreneurship-Ader zieht sich dennoch wie ein roter Faden durch seinen bisherigen Werdegang: „Ich hatte immer irgendwie den Drang, ok ich möcht‘ so Market Opportunitäten, die sich ergeben, die möchte ich ausnutzen und einen Mehrwert daraus schlagen“. Das jüngste Beispiel seiner Projekte ist das 2016 gegründete Ed-Tech Startup GoStudent, mit dem er und Co-Founder Gregor nun den europäischen Bildungsbereich zu revolutionieren versuchen. Zeugnistag Müsste Felix dem heutigen Schulsystem ein Zeugnis ausstellen, würde die Art und Weise wie Unterricht abgehalten wird nicht immer die Bestnote verdienen. Eine gute Lehrperson sei jemand der Begeisterung für sein Fach mitbringe, jemand der inspirieren könne aber gleichzeitig auch pädagogische Fähigkeiten besitze. Diese Lehrer:innen gäbe zwar es da draußen, nur leider hat nicht jedes der rund 70 Millionen Schulkinder in Europa unmittelbaren Zugang zu diesen. Genau das will GoStudent ändern indem es einen digitalen Service anbietet, der erstklassige Tutor:innen mit Schüler:innen zusammenbringt. Österreichs schnellst-wachsendes Startup Mittlerweile ist Felix’ Ed-Tech Startup in mehr als 10 Ländern in ganz Europa aktiv. Aber um das Ziel eine globale Schule zu schaffen auch tatsächlich umzusetzen, braucht es in einem Operations-lastigen Unternehmen wie GoStudent auch die nötige Manpower. Allein im letzten Jahr rekrutierte Felix‘ Team 400+ Mitarbeiter:innen and counting, denn GoStudents Belegschaft wächst weiter rasant. Ein derartiges Hyperwachstum stellt eine besonders kritische Phase für jedes Unternehmen dar, nicht zuletzt, weil es mehr als nur talentierte Mitarbeiter:innen braucht, um erfolgreich zu sein. Hypergrowth sei in diesem Sinne ein bisschen wie Leistungssport, meint Felix. Einerseits sei es Kopfsache – man müsse als Mitarbeiter:in das Mindset und die Werte des Unternehmens teilen, sowie die erforderliche Motivation mitbringen, andererseits müsse man auch bereit sein, die nötige Arbeit zu leisten, um sich gemeinsam im Rennen um Platz 1 durchzukämpfen. Eine derartige Arbeitskultur, sei natürlich nicht für jede:n etwas und um genau jene Mitarbeiter:innen zu finden, die die Mission des Unternehmens mittragen und leben, brauche es v.a. Geduld: “ durch dieses schnelle Wachstum, wachsen deine Strukturen einfach nicht so schnell mit. Selbst wenn du eine Finanzierungsrunde aufstellt und jetzt 200 Millionen mehr am Firmenkonto hast, das heißt nicht, dass du zehnmal so schnell gute Leute findest. Gute Leute zu finden, generell Mitarbeiter im Unternehmen zu finden, die da mit anpacken wollen, die auch den Drive, die Energie haben – dieses Problem wird nicht durch Geld gelöst.“ Eine der wichtigsten Erkenntnisse aus dem vergangen Jahr ist für Felix daher, dass ein starkes Anfangs- und Managementteam aufzustellen der Schlüsselfaktor in jeder Expansion ist. Denn die ersten fünf Mitarbeiter:innen beeinflussen das Mindset der nächsten 50 und so fort. Was man dabei unterschätze sei allerdings, wie viel zurückhaltender und vorsichtiger man selbst werde, je größer das Unternehmen und je höher der Einsatz wird. Hier mutig zu bleiben und weiterhin eine gewisse Risikobereitschaft zu zeigen, sei enorm wichtig aber auch ein Lernprozess von dem selbst Felix und sein krisensicheres Team nicht gefeit sind. Den Mount Everest erklimmen 2020 hat GoStudent seine Mitarbeiterschaft mehr als verzehnfacht, in fünf Jahren soll GoStudent dann eine Plattform sein an der kein Elternteil, Schüler:in oder Leher.in mehr vorbeikommt. Um bei der Analogie des Leistungssportes zu bleiben: „Der Bildungsbereich ist definitiv ein  Mount Everest oder K2 Gipfel, weil es ist so fragmentiert, es gibt so viele verschiedene Player,  jeder von uns hat Bildung in irgendeiner Form erlebt  jeder hat in irgendeiner Form eine persönliche Erfahrung, was natürlich dann auch den Effekt hat – jeder hat eine Meinung dazu – und bei Bildung hat jeder eine sehr starke Meinung.“ All diese unterschiedlichen Stakeholder und Ansichten auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu bringen, sei dabei natürlich eine Herausforderung. Am Ende des Tages möchte man aber einen Mehrwert schaffen und Familien einen Service bieten, der jedem/jeder Schüler:in dabei hilft ihr volles Potenzial zu erreichen.

"42","https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-blockchain-nfts-crypto-mit-jurgen-hobarth/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly | Blockchain, NFTs & Crypto mit Jürgen Höbarth","One Man Company Builder mit verschiedenen Netzwerken „Mich hat einfach immer Technik fasziniert.  Für mich war das so faszinierend – du sitzt in Oberösterreich und du kannst eine Website aufmachen in Australien. Jetzt ist das für jeden komplett normal.“, berichtet Jürgen mit oberösterreichischem Dialekt-Einschlag über Webcam aus Hongkong. Von dort aus arbeitet er nun in seinen eigenen Worten als „One Man Company Builder mit verschiedenen Netzwerken“ und fokussiert sich dabei v.a. auf Blockchain Technologie, Crypto Currencies und Tokenisierung. Im Gespräch kommt heraus, dass Jürgen schon immer jemand war, der technologische Trends früh erkannt hat – eine Art technologisches Frühwarnsystem sozusagen. Auf die Frage hin, wie er denn seine Ideen generiert, antwortet er unverblümt es sei nicht anders als bei einem herkömmlichen Analysten in der Finanzwelt: Man analysiert wie Dinge ablaufen und bildet sich eine Meinung darüber. Dazu sei es aber auch wichtig den Medienclutter unserer Zeit zur Seite zu schieben und seinem eigenen Instinkt zu folgen – wenn wir doch alle Jürgen Höbarth’s Instinkt hätten. “Wat isn jetz Crypto Oma?” Dieser Instinkt ist es auch, der Jürgens Interesse an Krypto schon geweckt hat, als diese noch in den Kinderschuhen steckte. „Was E-Mail zur traditionellen Post ist, [sind] Crypto Currencies zur traditionellen Geldwirtschaft“, erklärt uns Jürgen in einem Satz. Damit könne man derzeit online bezahlen und v.a. auch spekulieren. Spekulieren sei hier allerdings das Stichwort, denn investieren und spekulieren würden in diesem Kontext häufig verwechselt. Ob man heute noch in Bitcoin investieren sollte? Wenn man Jürgen um seine professionelle Meinung bittet, sei das eine Frage die sich jede_r selbst stellen muss. Was für traditionelle Investitionsmethoden gilt, gelte auch für Bitcoin und Co.: Vorerst sollte man ein allgemeines Verständnis für die Grundlagen des Finanzwesens aufbauen und für sich persönlich entscheiden, ob man es finanziell verkraften könne auch Geld dabei zu verlieren. Wenn man denkt, man könne einmal in Krypto investieren und danach sofort seinen Job kündigen und einen Sportwagen kaufen, liege man falsch, meint Jürgen. Pumpamental vs. Fundamental Wichtig sei auch Bitcoin derzeit als ein eher langfristiges Investment zu betrachten und die Kryptowährungen zugrundeliegende Kultur verstehen zu lernen. Diese könne nämlich durch unterschiedlichste (Hype-)Faktoren stark beeinflusst werden – daher auch die Unterscheidung zwischen sogenannten „Fundamental“ und „Pumpamental“ Coins. Ein Beispiel zur Erklärung: „Kim Kardashian macht einen Fonds auf für Crypto. Ich bin mir sicher die kann eine Milliarde raisen, weil würd man investieren wenn Kim Kardashian eine Coin macht? Klar, weil da sind Pumpamentals da“ und diese erzeugen eine gewisse Aufmerksamkeit, einen gewissen Hype und dadurch auch den Reiz darin Geld anzulegen. „Wenn die ZIB über etwas berichtet, dann ist es da“ Ein Hype, über den in den letzten Wochen sogar in gängigen österreichischen Medien berichtet wurde, ist jener um NFTs – non fungible tokens. Diese, meint Jürgen, könne man sich als eine Art Container vorstellen, in den man verschiedene Dinge hineinpacken kann. So könnte theoretisch von einer Wohnung bis zu einem Turnschuh alles digital durch ein NFT repräsentiert werden. Klingt komplex? Ist es auch. Aber wenn es nach Jürgen geht werden NFTs in einigen Jahren sogar noch weiter verbreitet sein als Crypto Currencies selbst. To the moon? Letztlich ist das, was wir bisher von NFTs, Krypto und ihren Begleitern gesehen haben aber nur ein kleiner Teil des unvorstellbaren Zukunftspotenzials einer Technologie, die von vielen Verfechter_innen auch als Katalysator eines größeren, systemischen Wandels unserer Gesellschaft betrachtet wird. „Technologie soll Dinge vereinfachen und Dinge optimieren. Ich brauch jetzt nicht für jede Standard Transaktion von einer Wohnung einen Rechtsanwalt und für jede GesmbH Eröffnung muss dieser und jener unterschreiben“, das könne man durchaus effizienter gestalten, stimmt Jürgen dem Thema bei. Dennoch glaubt er nicht daran, dass eine vollständige Dezentralisierung unserer Systeme tatsächlich möglich sein könnte. Am Ende denkt er, wird eine Kombination aus Neuem und Bestehendem gefunden werden.

"43","https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-die-zukunft-von-osterreich-mit-hansi-hansmann/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly | Die Zukunft von Österreich mit Hansi Hansmann","Serial Entrepreneur & Business Angel – CURRENTLY NOT INVESTING Hansi Hansmann ist wohl jedem in der österreichischen Startup-Szene ein Begriff. Während ihn seine Linkedin Bio als Serial Entrepreneur und Business Angel ausweist; beschreibt Hansi sich selbst als jemand, der sich leidenschaftlich gerne mit innovativen Ideen beschäftigt und v.a. das tut was ihm Spaß macht. Nämlich mit jungen, energiegeladenen Unternehmer_innen zusammenzuarbeiten, das Potenzial in ihren kreativen Geschäftsideen zu erkennen und diese mit seiner Expertise und Erfahrung zu unterstützen. Im Laufe der Jahre hat Hansi, so eine Vielzahl von Startups auf ihrem Weg zum Erfolg begleitet. Runtastic, mySugr, und shpock sind nur ein paar Beispiele aus dem breitgefächerten Portfolio seiner Hansmengroup. Das Hansi Hansmann Erfolgsrezept Auf die Frage, welche Faktoren für ihn bei einer Investitionsentscheidung unabdingbar seien, wird deutlich, dass Hansi sich bei einem Großteil seiner Investments v.a. von seiner Menschenkenntnis leiten lässt. Eine genaue Anleitung, wie man das perfekte Tech-Startup-Rezept selbst zuhause zubereiten kann, findet sich im Anhang, aber soviel sei gesagt – mit einer guten Idee allein ist es nicht getan. Hansi investiert in Teams: „Eine grandiose Idee  mit einem durchschnittlich guten Team hat immer schlechtere Chancen, als ein nicht so gutes Projekt mit einem exzellenten Team.“ Gegenseitige Sympathie spiele dabei ebenfalls eine fundamentale Rolle. Jedes Startup gehe früher oder später durch seine Krisen, meint Hansi. Diese aber gemeinsam zu bewältigen, mit einem Team, das sich gegenseitig unterstützt und sich in seinen Eigenschaften und Fähigkeiten ergänzt, sei letztendlich was ein erfolgreiches Projekt ausmacht. Die Lage der Nation Doch das Funkeln, das in Hansis Augen leuchtet, während er über seine bisherigen Unternehmungen spricht, verblasst recht schnell als die gesellschaftliche Haltung Österreichs zur Startup-Szene zum Thema wird. Grausam ist das Wort, das Hansi hier direkt über die Lippen kommt: „Die Ösi-Mentalität  ist weder unternehmerfreundlich und schon gar nicht Startup-freundlich“. Österreicher_innen seien dem Unternehmertum gegenüber grundsätzlich negativ eingestellt und nicht ausreichend risikoaffin. Beides sind Faktoren, die sich besonders nachteilig auf Startups auswirken. The way out Das unternehmerische Armutszeugnis, das Hansi unserer Alpennation somit ausstellt, könne allerdings v.a. durch Bildung verbessert werden. Diese müsse wirksamer auf die digitale Welt vorbereiten und zudem unternehmerisches Denken bereits im frühen Kindealter spielerisch fördern. Auch eine potente Imagekampagne der Regierung sieht Hansi als zielführende Maßnahme, um das Bild des Unternehmertums in Österreich nachhaltig positiver zu besetzen. Daniel und Markus jubilieren stumm. „Es sollte nicht sein, dass nur einzelne Unternehmerpersönlichkeiten – die es immer geben wird, überall – erfolgreich sind und sich trotz aller Widrigkeiten durchsetzen können. Es sollte so sein, dass die Grundlagen des Systems so sind, dass möglichst viele Unternehmer dabei rauskommen und die Anzahl der erfolgreichen Unternehmerpersönlichkeiten da natürlich eine unendlich viel Größere ist “ , meint Hansi. Soweit hätte Österreich es allerdings versäumt, derartige Grundlagen zu schaffen. Apropos Versäumnisse Wenn wir schon beim Thema Versäumnisse sind, sprechen wir doch auch gleich über das Corona-Management der österreichischen Bundesregierung. Obwohl es generell natürlich schwer sei als Politiker_in in einer Pandemie etwas richtig zu machen, kann auch Hansi nicht leugnen, dass Österreich an vielen Fronten auch Besseres hätte leisten können. „Was ich bis heute nicht verstehe ist, dass wir eigentlich technologisch, digital in der Lage wären Covid ganz exzellent, vollkommen unter Kontrolle zu haben. Wir haben alle Möglichkeiten  und wir tun‘s nicht.“ Standortmarketing, Standortmarketing, Standortmarketing In der Innovation liegt für Hansi Österreichs und Europas letzte Chance, auf der Weltbühne nicht in komplette, wirtschaftliche Bedeutungslosigkeit abzudriften und den Vorsprung, den sich Länder wie Israel durch die rasche Durchimpfung ihrer Bevölkerung verschafft haben aufzuholen. Europa biete durch seine reiche historische Tradition und seinen Multikulturalismus einen einzigartigen Nährboden für Kreativität. Diese Vorzüge gelte es zu nutzen, entsprechend zu vermarkten und sich aktiv in Bereichen zu positionieren, die andere noch nicht eingenommen haben. Insbesondere Gender Diversity sei Hansis Meinung nach ein Anziehungsfaktor, mit dem Wien als Wirtschaftsstandort wirklich glänzen könnte. Aber auch die Klimakrise sei und bleibe ein globales Thema, das Österreich weiterhin zum Anlass nehmen könne, um in Sachen Innovation Stellung zu beziehen. Wind of Change Aber wie in vielen anderen Fällen stünde Österreich sich auch hier selbst im Weg. Neben der bereits angesprochenen Risikoaversion, zählt auch ein gewisses Maß an Veränderungsresistenz zu den prägenden Eigenschaften der, in Hansis Worten, „grausamen“ Ösi-Mentalität. Als bestes Beispiel ließe sich die Wintersportindustrie nennen, wo schon lange ein Umdenken hätte passieren müssen, anstatt veraltete Geschäftsmodelle bis zum letzten Tropfen auszumelken. Ja, Veränderung tue weh, aber Veränderung sei letztendlich unumgänglich und je früher man sich darauf einstelle und Raum für Innovation und Fortschritt schaffe, umso eher könne man diese Veränderung noch selbst mitgestalten. Erneut sei hier auch die Politik gefordert, zukunftsorientiert statt wahlkampffokussiert und europäisch statt national zu denken: „Das ist die einzige Lösung. Wir müssen alle mehr wie Europäer denken und an ganz Europa denken, wenn schon nicht an die ganze Welt.  Nur so können wir langfristig  unseren Wohlstand, den es nun einmal in Europa gibt, halbwegs bewahren oder halbwegs aufrechterhalten.“ Anhang: Das Hansi Hansmann Erfolgsrezept für TechStartups (Schwierigkeitsgrad: mittel bis schwer) Erster Schritt: Legen Sie den Boden der Backform zunächst mit einer guten Idee aus. Oft wurzelt diese in der Bewältigung eines Problems, mit dem die Gründer_innen selbst oder ihnen nahestehende Personen konfrontiert sind. Zweiter Schritt: Fügen Sie 2-4 Gründungsmitglieder hinzu. Eines allein reicht oft nicht aus, um das Projekt aufgehen zu lassen, während 5 oder mehr den Brei meist versalzen. Verwenden Sie in diesem Schritt nur erstklassige, hochwertige Zutaten: – eines der Teammitglieder sollte die Führungsposition einnehmen und das Produkt leben – eines sollte die Technologie hinter der Idee beherrschen – eines sollte extrovertiert sein und die Idee verkaufen können – eines sollte die bedeutendsten KPIs auch im Schlaf abrufen können Achtung: Seien Sie nicht verunsichert, in manchen Fällen können zwei dieser Schlüsselfaktoren auch in einer Person vereint sein. Dritter Schritt: Gut durchmischen. Achten Sie allerdings beim Mixen darauf, dass sich alle Rollen gleichmäßig verteilen. Vierter Schritt: Streuen Sie etwas gegenseitige Sympathie obendrauf bevor Sie investieren und das Projekt bei mittlerer bis hoher Hitze 5-10 Jahre backen. É voila!

"44","https://austrianstartups.com/guest-post-success-factors-among-startups-in-austria/","AustrianStartups","Guest Post: Success Factors among Startups in Austria","Learning 1: Industry and Business Model are Key The industry a startup operates in, and the business model it employs, are closely correlated with a startup’s success – whether measured in turnover, valuations or the amount of funding it obtains. For valuations, for instance, the industry a startup operates in represents the very most important predictor for its valuation, followed by its age and business model. Figure 1 shows the features ranked by their importance for valuations for a Random Forest Model after training. Figure 1: Feature Importance for Valuations The boxplots of Figure 2 compare the turnover of startups between different industries, with the aim of demonstrating the impact and differences between industries. The green triangle marks the turnover means. It is important to mention that the horizontal axis states turnover in categories from 0 to 9 – which should be interpreted similarly to a logistic scale: for instance, the difference between categories 8 and 9 is magnitudes larger than the difference between categories 1 and 2. [2] Nevertheless, it is clear that the industries of FinTech, Software Development and Electronics are among the most lucrative ones for startups in Austria.Figure 2: Comparing startups’ Turnover in different Industries For business models, in general the data suggests that the more digital and scalable they are , the higher is the likelihood of a startup to perform well. These findings were further confirmed by flexible working hours being significantly and positively related to higher valuations. While it is unlikely that flexible working hours per se are of so much impact, they represent a good indicator on how digital a startup’s industry and business model are: for instance, in manufacturing or gastronomy, flexible working hours are much more difficult to offer than in software development. Learning 2: Social startups focus on less lucrative and scalable Business Models and Industries When simply comparing profit-driven startups, and ones primarily following social or ecological targets, based on their average turnover, valuations or funding amounts, social startups seem to face great disadvantages. However, drilling down deeper through the data, it becomes clear that social startups systematically are founded in less lucrative industries, and with less scalable business models – which is, to be fair, quite logical. For instance, industries like food or clothing provide more obvious opportunities for social improvement than FinTech or IT. Figure 3 shows their differing distribution among industries compared to profit driven startups (white-ish the profit driven ones, and the social startups in blue). For example, one may note that not a single social startup that responded to the survey operated in the very lucrative FinTech industry. This phenomenon explains the largest part of disadvantage they face on average compared to profit-driven startups. However, one must keep in mind that the sample employed for analysis was collected in March and April 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that social startups are hit much harder than their more digitalized profit-driven counterparts. For this reason, I believe that policy makers should support social startups especially well in order for them to survive the current crisis. Figure 3: The Distribution of startups among Industries One factor that was found to be negatively correlated with startup valuations was employee participation in the startup’s decision making processes. Such participation may conflict with and compromise a clear focus on profit maximization, which might make such startups less attractive investment cases. Social startups could be more inclined to offer such participation to their employees, in turn hurting their valuations. Learning 3: Cooperation with larger Corporations pays off After controlling for other factors, cooperations only with large corporations were still found to have significant positive effects on a startup’s turnover. This was not the case for cooperation with SME’s, universities, or other public institutions. One explanation may be that startups benefit significantly from their larger partners’ scale, established business relations and vast resources. Similarly, spin-offs from large companies experience benefits in turnover compared to independently founded startups, and other spin-offs. Learning 4: A high Share of internal R&D benefits Sales Moreover, the analysis showed clearly that startups‘ turnover benefits from a high percentage of product development performed internally. Outsourcing such a core value chain activity seems to hurt sales growth. One possible explanation may be the ability to tailor solutions closer to customer needs when developing products in-house. This is a finding that should also be of importance not only for startups, but may apply to all kinds of companies. Further, there exists a weak correlation between employee cash bonuses and sales performance. However, this correlation was not significant. Learning 5: Startups founded in Teams have easier Access to Funding Notably, the amounts of funding and the valuations the average solo-founder obtains for his startup are significantly lower than for comparable startups founded by a team of entrepreneurs. This may stem from the wide anticipation of founding teams’ better performance among professionals and venture capitalists – which makes sense, since a team can deliver a wider range of complementary skills, more manpower, a more extensive professional network, and additional points of view towards a venture. However, within academia, whether teams actually perform better than solo entrepreneurs is heavily disputed, and evidence is inconclusive. Also, in the study at hand, there was no superior performance found for teams regarding turnover. After all, it may well be that solo founders have a harder time securing funding because venture capitalists are negatively biased towards them. Another factor shown to have significant positive impact on funding amounts represent patents, which may result from their employment in the valuation process, or as an indicator for public sources of funding. Methodology and Limitations The analysis upon which this article is based was performed for a master thesis (“Quantitative Analysis of Startups’ Success Factors in Austria”). The data upon which this analysis is built was collected in the course of the ASM Survey 2018. The total sample size was 368 responses – which in turn varied slightly depending on data cleaning for the respective success indicators (turnover, valuations or external capital received. As such, the results presented are prone to all kinds of limitations stemming from survey data, such as self-selection and biased answers. In order to conduct analysis on the success factors of turnover, valuations and external capital received, survey data – which had originally been collected in nominal ranges of varying sizes – was transformed to ordinal categories from 0 to 9. This resulted not only in a loss of information, but also made analysis more complicated, as the data analysis task may be tackled both as a regression and classification problem. Analysis was conducted through meaningful data visualisation and interpretation, correlation analysis, t-tests and f-tests, Random Forest Analysis, and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). If you are interested in more details, or in the whole master thesis upon which the article at hand is based, you are welcome to reach out to philipp.schardax@austrianstartups.com . The data upon which the following analysis is built was collected in conjuncture by AustrianStartup, the Center of Entrepreneurship by Vienna’s University of Economics and Business, and Austria’s largest research organization, the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). We highly acknowledge all these organizations’ efforts and expertise in collecting the data.

"46","https://austrianstartups.com/internationalisation-of-startups/","AustrianStartups","Key challenges to going abroad – Internationalisation of startups","The concept of the “liability of foreignness” is well known in international business and it is no less of a hurdle for startups as it is for multinational corporations. It refers to the problems faced by firms trying to overcome the difficulties of expanding abroad. The term encompasses the problem faced by foreign companies in competition with local existing firms and ranges from obvious challenges like having to export physical goods over a longer distance as well cultural barriers. From the beginning, all startups dream of global success with their products or services being consumed or utilised with disregard for national borders. For startups in smaller countries like Austria the greater revenue opportunities and potential for more impact makes international success an enticing aim. Europe-wide, more than half of all startups generate some form of revenue abroad. For countries like Finland and Hungary this is very high whereas for countries like Germany with a large domestic market, the share of startups focused on foreign markets is lower. At 51 percent of startups generating revenue abroad, Austria sits slightly below the European Startup Monitor average of 55 percent and is the European country with lowest proportion of revenues made in Non-EU countries. Despite this, Austrian startups represent the highest share generating revenues in fellow European countries. “Austria is the European country with lowest proportion of revenues made in Non-EU countries”. Austria’s position in Central Europe and small domestic size mean that the potential for early stage internationalisation is high, however, it is not easy. Looking at the most recent European Start-up Monitor from 2016, we will look at the main challenges that startups face when it comes to internationalising. Differences in legislation and regulations Around one third of European startups claimed that the biggest problem they had was the differing legislations and regulations. This is a challenge that imposes additional costs on startups and makes exporting to companies with a greater regulatory gap, like those outside of the EU very difficult. This alongside the economy of distance explains why revenue generated worldwide is much lower than in fellow European countries. Thus, it goes without saying, any successful internationalisation strategy needs to take into consideration at an early stage the regulatory differences in different markets. This is especially the case for companies that require, licenses or regulatory approval like in fintech or health. Differing taxation systems should also be taken into consideration as they increase the operational costs imposed by internationalisation. “Around one third of European startups claimed that the biggest problem they had was the differing legislations and regulations.” Adapting services and products to foreign market If a startup has been successful in their domestic market they can rely on a strong brand reputation and a good understanding of the market’s needs and expectations. However, there is no one-size-fits-all formula which addresses the local needs. Startups must have a good understanding of what consumers or clients require and what incumbent firms are doing. If anything, this challenge acts as a warning against entering new market too quickly or underestimating the challenges that come with it. Despite this, technology services that offer non-tangible goods and a naturally ‘born global’ product like Vienna based travel website, TourRadar, or language learning apps like busuu (founded by Austrian Bernhard Niesner) are often better aimed at an international audience from the outset. Cultural differences Although cultural difference relates to the point raised above, it is also important to consider how culture in itself represents a major challenge for a startup trying to expand outside of the comfort zone of its own market. To be successful, a startup will often have to provide services in the local language as well as avoid offence by breaking cultural faux pas. It goes without saying that a craft beer manufacturer would be best advised not to look for distributors in Saudi Arabia. However, sometimes these differences can be more subtle and impact the operational side of things. This is especially the case in business-to-business relationships where different corporate cultures make it difficult for start-ups to access decision makers. Differences of culture therefore must be considered in strategic considerations whereby acquiring local human capital, working with foreign partners and even setting up a subsidiary are all options to help to overcome the “liability of foreignness”. Internationalisation is both enticing and difficult. It requires a combination of trial and error as well as an international strategy. Whatever happens, startups must choose their markets carefully and plan ahead. If success at home is difficult, success abroad may represent more of a challenge for some startups, whilst it may even be easier than at home for others – it all depends on your product and finding the right market for it. – Written by Samuel Hargreaves – This represents the start of a series of blogs into the internationalisation of startups looking at the challenges and success stories of Austrian companies. The next blog article will be focusing on regulatory barriers and in particular the difficulties faced by fintechs.","September 13th, 2018","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180611_015458-e1543494413577-300x300.jpg"
"47","https://austrianstartups.com/israel-the-startup-nation/","AustrianStartups","Israel – The Startup Nation","Formerly known for Oranges and Kibbutzim, Israel has long morphed into a global hotspot for innovation. Given its geopolitical situation, no natural resources and a lack of water, one is left to wonder how this young and small country in the Middle East has managed to become one of the most innovative nations of the world with Tel Aviv being among the world’s most acclaimed startup clusters. Israel’s Silicon Wadi (Wadi: Arabic for Valley) – i.e. the metropolitan area around Tel Aviv ranks as the sixth largest cluster in the world (2017 Startup Genome Report). These startups are often successful. Many are acquired by big multinational companies (for example Mobileye in 2017 for 15.3 billion USD in the up to today largest acquisition of the country) or are going public. Israel with a population of only 8.5 million ranks third after the substantially more populous countries of US and China when it comes to the number of companies having IPOed on NASDAQ in the last 40 years (more than 250 Israeli companies). In Israel innovation-startup ecosystem has been and remains to be the result of a bold and forward-looking policy. Initiated in 1968 with a political decision the country has since made the transition from a centralist agricultural society into a competitive knowledge-based innovation economy. Especially since the 1980ies, gloomy desert settlements and barely developed regions have become thriving economic centers with a vibrant startup scene and corporate offices from around the world. The Office of the Chief Scientists (OCS) of the Ministry of Economy (& MATIMOP) was put in charge of supervising, proposing and implementing Israeli innovation policies. Renamed as the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) it still serves today as an independent and impartial public entity for the benefit of the Israeli innovation ecosystem and Israeli economy as a whole. Its role is to nurture and develop Israeli innovation resources, while creating and strengthening the infrastructure and framework needed to support the entire knowledge industry. Among the legion of factors that make up the Israeli ecosystem, the following stand out: R&D: no other country has been spending a greater part of its GDP on military and civil R&D. Venture Capital: only in the US it is more available. Technological Incubator Program: a program that was to create jobs for immigrants became one of the ecosystem’s drivers. Industry-Academia Cooperation: researching for the market & the entrepreneurial spirit at universities. Military: IDF’s special role in molding startup founders. Culture: Chuzpah & networking “one grade removed”. Since its foundation in 1948, the country has invested heavily in military R&D in light of its distinct geopolitical situation and conflict related security threats. This has led the foundation for the development of the computer, security, telecommunications, electronics, and semiconductor industries, the Startup Nation is known for today. In recent decades, support for civil R&D has caught up, with Israel investing around 4.21% of its GDP in R&D in 2013. Based on the Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development funding through its central instrument, the R&D Fund, have had a multiplier effect on private sector research investment. On top of the country’s dire situation, in the 1980ies one million new immigrants (then about 20% of the population) arrived from the former Soviet Union. These mostly well-educated immigrants pushed into the already tight labor market, that was unable to absorb them. Since 1991 a newly established OCS led Technological Incubator Program was to mitigate the situation by helping those new immigrants to start a company on their own. What was primarily intended as a tool to create employment for immigrants, turned out to be crucial for the genesis of the ecosystem. The technology neutral Technological Incubator Program has since sought to mitigate some of the shortcomings of new ventures, such as lack of capital, inexperienced management or lack of understanding regarding markets. For those startups accepted into its 2-year program, it provides a supportive environment with free offices and resources, mentoring, assistance in finding product-market fit and determining technological and marketing feasibility, business and legal advice, investor relations, networking, as well as pre-seed and seed capital. Technology Incubator Programs cover 100% of their Startup’s approved budget during the program period (usually 2 years): 85% (max $ 1 million) via the OCS, 15% from the (today private) incubator operator in exchange for equity. Only if the startup turns out to be successful, the public grant is to be repaid by royalties in the amount of 3-5% of the annual income. Crucially, the 15% private incubator money ensures a diligent assessment whether the startup is promising enough to be accepted into the program. The public investment, on the other hand, allows incubators to support ventures that would otherwise be too risky. Today incubators are licensed under a franchise model by the OCS/IIA for a period of 8 years. Relatively modest use of taxpayer money has catalyzed private capital investment and has indirectly benefited the whole economy through spillovers. Israel took another innovative approach to help establish its Venture Capital (VC) industry. In 1993, the Yozma (Hebrew for “initiative”), often referred to as the most successful and original program in Israel’s history of innovation, offered to match investments by a foreign VC fund with public funds. A lever to start a VC industry was found, and as a result, in recent years only in the US and China has more VC been invested. In order to join the program, an Israeli fund had to cooperate with a foreign investment company. If together they managed to raise USD 12 million, the state would contribute another $ 8 million. In return, the state retained 40% ownership in the newly established fund. However, the private partners had the option to buy back the state’s shares within five years for the amount of the public investment plus interests. Thus, although the state accepted a considerable part of the risk (80% of the downside risk), it allowed private investors to reap the profit. To many foreign investors, this value preposition proved irresistible, and soon demand to join the program had become so high that the necessary amount of foreign investment was raised to $ 16 million. This cooperation was key to the program’s success: While the Israeli part was responsible for relationship management between investors and founders, the international partner contributed its network, market knowledge and experience as a VC-investor to help the startups scale. The plan worked out. Today, Israel ranks top in the availability of VC. Reasons why Israel is so successful Isreal ranks top in university-industry collaboration. Commercialization of academic research is expressly encouraged also through state funded programs. Inventions of academic staff are property of the university, that is commercialized by special affiliated Technology Transfer Organizations (TTOs). Led by experienced business people these for-profit companies ensure the protection of this IP (esp. via patents) and commercialize them. TTOs also link the research institution to industry, startup founders and investors. From royalties received Israeli universities can increase their research budget substantially. Flexible terms of employment for university academic staff and a proportionate participation of the researcher in any royalties resulting from his developments further breed an entrepreneurial spirit in the research departments. R&D departments of big multinational companies are crucial components of the clusters. Big players such as Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Dropbox, Dell, Citibank, Merck Group or SAP tap into the country’s innovative potential – and support the ecosystem at large: They hire engineers, acquire startups or cooperate with them, establish a branded co-working space or run their own accelerator. In only 70 years, Israel’s population has increased more than six fold. This has been due to waves of immigration making Israel a multicultural country of immigrants that continues to actively encourage immigration. Public support programs and a pronounced “welcome culture” facilitate integration of new arrivals. Many immigrants are natural entrepreneurs – they are more willing to take risks than people who have not left their familiar environment in order to start anew in another country in which they are at a disadvantage on the local labor market. Thus, a nation of immigrants is also a nation of entrepreneurs. In Israel, entrepreneurial spirit is regarded highly and founding a startup is the preferred career choice of many. The country’s multicultural set-up together with its open culture of discussion and lack of formal hierarchies breeds creativity. Living in a conflict-stricken region in the Middle East where war can basically break out every day makes people not only enjoy life in spite of this situation (World Happiness Report ranks Israel 11th), but also puts the entrepreneurial risk of founding a startup in perspective. If you cannot be sure whether there will be a war when you will wake up in the morning, founding a startup looks a lot less scary. Israeli entrepreneurs are thus known for being risk-takers and do not shy away from daring decisions. Additionally, failure is understood as part of the entrepreneurial process, and an unsuccessful startup as another stepping stone towards a breakthrough. Improvising is a valuable skill in a Middle East – and comes in handy in a startups inherently unripe processes and systems. The military service is a crucial factor of the Israeli ecosystem, that cannot be replicated. The (for men and women) compulsory army service in the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) helps develop character traits that are useful for aspiring entrepreneurs, such as the ability to make decisions on complex issues under pressure, self-confidence, self-assertion and the ability to work in a team. Many startups are based on technical innovations originating in the army. The Elite Intelligence and Cybersecurity Unit 8200 has been legendary for its graduates and their potential to found successful ventures. Its small domestic market puts Israeli startups at a disadvantage – leading to the prevalent business strategy of “go global fast”. The flipside of a small country is a close-knit network, further strengthened by the shared experience of the military service. A culturally rooted dislike for authorities and hierarchies makes people approachable and ready to help with introductions and advice. The promotion of lighthouse successes – joined together with the aforementioned self-confidence – urges many Israelis into trying to become an acclaimed entrepreneur themselves. Finally, a nation branding campaign has created the label of the “Startup Nation Israel” further attracting interest and attention from investors, big companies and talent alike. Key Learnings for Austria Israel seems to have figured out a way or two to “startup” Innovation-Startup Ecosystems. For Austria especially interesting are the targeted decisions the Israeli government took to help push its innovation ecosystem forward. Special cultural factors and of course the distinct role of the military aside, targeted policies played a crucial role in establishing an VC-industry, integrating immigrants to become entrepreneurs, inviting MNC into the country and encouraging academic-industry cooperation. However, as in all case studies, also with the Israeli Startup experience, the role of its specific history, cultural aspects and geopolitical situation may not be underestimated when lessons shall be derived for other ecosystems.","December 29th, 2018","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blogposts_hubs-300x181.jpg"

"50","https://austrianstartups.com/later-stage-breakfast/","AustrianStartups","Our first Growth Stage Breakfast","OKR & Managing Growth OKR systems. What exactly are they? What do later stage startups know about them and how do they use them effectively or not so effectively? All these questions have been discussed at AustrianStartups’ very first “Later Stage Breakfast” – an event for later stage startups who talk about their previous experiences while having breakfast together. The attendants of the first event were HappyMed, Shpock, Blockpit, Hackabu, Bikemap to only name a few. Before we tell you all the insights of the event, let’s start by unveiling what exactly OKR’s are: “OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results”, according to http://eleganthack.com. “The form of the OKR has been more or less standardized. The Objective is qualitative, and the KR’s (most often three) are quantitative. They are used to focus a group or individual around a bold goal. The objective sets a goal for a set period of time, usually a quarter. The key results tell you if the objective has been met by the end of the time.” How does this concern us? Basically, founders of later stage startups met up with AustrianStartups last week to talk about their own experiences with setting objectives and what their key learnings with OKR’s have been so far. Let’s see what they came up with! The key finding There are four main point you have to consider when implementing OKR systems in your startup: Your goals have to be measurable (& actionable). It’s basic knowledge, but it’s key. Every team member ought to be kept updated constantly about the current status of every KR. A way to implement this, is to have weekly, monthly or quarterly townhalls with every team member. There is no correct system on implementing OKR’s. Every startup should experiment what works best for them and their company. OKR systems come hand in hand with extra effort and lots of extra time that has to be invested, especially in the beginning. However, all these aspects combined will give your company a tool to help you focus on your business goals and measure your outcome, not just your output! What else to consider. Ok, we all know now that OKR’s can be a significant tool for your startup, as well as the main findings of startups who have already implemented OKR’s into their everyday business. Is there something else to consider? Yes. It’s also important to realize that there is no “too early” for implementing an OKR system. Just start with setting objectives for your management, as well as objectives for each department of your business, and experiment with it. “Each department can take the time for an individual brainstorming session where all ideas are welcome. The output of these sessions can be sorted and structured to make it measurable: the only thing left is to present it to the management which will then in turn, either officially approve it or not” Philipp from HappyMed recommends. Furthermore, it’s relevant to understand that OKR’s and the culture of your company are not working exclusively without one another. It’s quite the opposite: OKR’s can even be used to engage and enhance the intrinsic motivation of each worker: Want to implement OKR systems yourself? “These tools will help you” , says Theresa from Hackabu, before sharing some tips and tricks on the subject: Airtable – an online spreadsheet that gives you the power of a database to organize anything. Confluence – a commercial Wiki software that helps you communicating within your company. Google Sheets – a mash-up between Google Docs and Excel. weekdone – helps you plan weekly and set your goals quarterly. Ally – a flexible wage software that helps you with payroll accounting. To end it off. As we have previously mentioned, there is no perfect time to start OKR’s in your business. With the right tools and great motivation, it can support and improve your startup. Remember: “Do not over engineer. Adapt to your needs.” as Cornelius Palm from Blockpit puts it. And don’t give up, if something goes wrong – take the time to experiment and establish the best system for your own startup!","November 27th, 2018","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Breakfast_Nov18-e1543494062474-300x274.jpg"

"52","https://austrianstartups.com/message-new-managing-director/","AustrianStartups","A message from the new Managing Director","Four years ago, I started to get interested in startups. Fresh from the rewarding experience of building up my own football club, I looked for ways to make similar experiences in my professional life. AustrianStartups was exactly what I needed. It was my first contact point and helped me find my first job in the startup scene – taking over the lead of the Pioneers Challenge at Pioneers Festival. Now, four years and many challenging experiences later, I’m excited to take over as managing director at the very same organization that helped me so much at the beginning of my startup adventure. Since those early days, AustrianStartups has grown into a respected player in the ecosystem and certainly had a lasting positive impact on numerous startups in Austria. I’m excited to continue this development and reach new milestones with our highly motivated team. We do not want to create an artificial hype, but deliver well-grounded insights into why startups are an important part of our economy, and actively support them in their development. With this in mind, we already carved out some strategic goals for the future that range from establishing an independent startup think tank to becoming more international as an organization. Still, my plan for the next few weeks will primarily be to listen. I want to talk to as many of you as possible to make sure I really understand the needs and concerns of all stakeholders in the startup ecosystem. So whenever you see me at a startup event, please approach me and tell me how we could make your startup’s life easier. Yesterday, I already had some interesting conversations at our monthly Stammtisch and several people indicated that it would be helpful if AustrianStartups could offer guidelines for legal and financial documents that startups often need. I think that’s a great idea, and we will definitely check what we can offer here. In general, I was blown away by the positive response and optimism for the whole ecosystem. Your enthusiasm will be a great source of energy for the whole team of AustrianStartups. To translate our visions into reality, we will need to further grow as an organization – so in case you want to join us in our quest to make Austria a startup hotspot, please apply for one of our volunteer positions here: austrianstartups.com/jobs/. I promise that you will be part of an amazing team, take over responsibility, learn a lot, and ultimately have a strong impact. Speaking of the team, I want to say thank you. Thank you for giving me such a warm welcome and working so diligently during the last few weeks, when it was still unclear who is going to take over. With your help and the support of our partners, I’m absolutely convinced that together we can lift the Austrian startup ecosystem to the next level. And now enough of the talking, let’s buckle down to work. I can’t wait to get going and help make Austria the place to be for all startups.

"53","https://austrianstartups.com/navigate-corporate-world-startup/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #48: How to navigate the corporate world as a startup","Maneuvering corporate partnerships can be tricky. Especially in the early stages of your startup. And having to dedicate a large amount of your resources to corporate partnerships that turn out to be less beneficial than initially expected is a waste of time, resources and obviously money you probably won’t have at that stage. Together with Maria Zesch, Chief Commercial Officer T-Mobile Austria, Christian Adelsberger, Founder and CEO of Parkbob, David Pichsenmeister, Co-Founder of Oratio and Oliver Csendes, CEO of Pioneers we discussed this hot topic. So consider these things before or when entering a partnership: Know what you want and what you can expect from the partnership. As a startup you need to know what you’re after. Be aware of what you want to get out of that partnership. Expectations are often too high as well. Just because a corporate offers a huge brand doesn’t mean that partnering up is automatically beneficial for your startup. So how can you know what to expect from your partnership? (Theoretically) It’s relatively simple… Communicate with your partners! Startups and corporates alike often make the mistake of not clarifying their goals and expectations at the beginning of a partnership. Both parties need to be clear about what they are bringing to the table and what they want to achieve by partnering up. You should also try to get a sense about the corporate’s intentions as early as possible. Ask them about what they would like to achieve by partnering up with you. And last but not least, always try to communicate and work with top management. Because top management support will make navigating completely different internal processes much easier. Be the driving force of the partnership. You are the agile startup. Don’t expect large corporates to change rapidly. A much bigger company is obviously going to have a harder time changing or speeding up internal processes than a startup. So those processes are definitely going to differ in speed. And there needs to be someone who coordinates said speed difference. This is where top management comes into play again: You need to communicate that you need the freedom to do your job and not be slowed down by large corporate processes. And securing that is going to be much easier by communicating and working with top level management. As high as you can get! And as Christian, CEO of Parkbob put it: “You have to be constantly meeting people, push topics again and again so they happen. Waiting for things to happen is not going to work.” Understand your partner. When pitching to corporates, always remember that at the end of the day for them it’s going to be about either saving money or making money by cooperating with your startup. Understand the value creation and business model of the corporate you’re potentially partnering up with and understand how your solution can fit into that. And like Oliver, CEO of Pioneers said, “Corporations are not there to help you. You’re there to earn money.” So always be clear about what you are selling and how it can help the corporate to reach its goals. Because that is what they’re looking for. You should also be aware of the corporate’s innovation strategy and the market they want to tackle by working with you. If it’s something completely different from what you do and you decide to work with a large corporate in an early stage of your startup, chances are that the large influx of money – compared to that of other customers you’re going to have at that stage – may force you in a direction you didn’t want to go for in the first place. Oliver’s Red flag: “If you ask them about their goals, like tweaking their business model, a better understanding of their internal ecosystem or a specific solution you might be able to hack for them and they say yes to everything, they probably don’t know what they are looking for and want to cooperate with startups because everybody else is doing it.” Understand your partner’s culture. How can you make sure that you can still achieve your goals if that one person who’s driving innovation leaves the company you’ve partnered up with? Culture. Try to get a sense for the internal culture of your (potential) corporate partner. And how does one go about getting said sense? Top level management! Because if top management doesn’t support a startup friendly culture, you’re going to have a hard time. A good trick to test the waters is asking for a meeting with the company’s CEO. If a CEO won’t give you 15 minutes of his or her time, chances are the internal corporate culture is not the best foundation for an early stage startup. Again: Full top management support is what you should be aiming for. Share your knowledge. But don’t share it mindlessly. David’s Red flag (Co-Founder of Oratio): “If a corporate approaches you and asks for free stuff right from the get go, be careful. If they’re asking for free workshops, product customizations or pilots, chances are they’re trying to use you as a cheap agency.” But don’t forget to consider that corporates need to know and fully understand the product and its value in order to move forward. Try to keep both aspects in mind. And again, communication and knowledge of your own goals are key here: What can both parties do for each other? Generally though, charging money for additional services your startup delivers – even if it’s not a huge amount – usually guarantees that a greenlighting decision is going to be made from higher up the chain. Which – as we know now – is a good thing. Get to know the people you are going to be working with At the end of the day it’s always people you’re working with. And while business knowledge is obviously your bread and butter, you should also really take a look at the people who will drive, manage, coordinate and control the relationships between their corporate and your startup. If the people whom you are dealing with don’t have passion for what they are doing, you should look at other partnership opportunities. So what should you take away from this month’s Stammtisch? Understand that there’s no free lunch. It’s a business relationship and both parties need to work on that. Be clear about what you’re investing and what you want. Communication! Preferably with top level management. Be the active party. You’re the agile, small startup. Constantly push topics and request meetings. Understand your potential corporate partner and the internal culture within said corporate. Try to understand things from their perspective. Share your knowledge but be aware of how or if that can benefit your startup. And get to know the people. Sometimes it’s more about gut feeling. Are the people you’re going to be working with passionate about the project? Is there chemistry between the people involved? And don’t forget that the best startups have lots of pitch-meetings. So don’t rush into things. That being said, see you at the next Stammtisch! © Markus Engelberger/graphicrecorder.at","July 27th, 2017","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/579T2070-300x200.jpg"
"54","https://austrianstartups.com/need-to-court-international-startups/","AustrianStartups","“We need to do more to court international startups”","“We need to do more to court international startups” Ruth Reitmeier Profil Portfolio spoke with Markus Raunig, Head of AustrianStartups, about Vienna’s advantages and flaws as a location for founders and challenges of the startup scene. Portfolio: Markus, are you the “Leitl” of startups? Markus Raunig (laughs): Not at all, I don’t see myself as an equivalent to Christoph Leitl, President of the Austrian Economic Chambers. AustrianStartups is a grassroots movement from the startup community with no compulsory membership fees. What are your key responsibilities and tasks? Markus: AustrianStartups is the first stop for anyone interested in startup topics. We support founders, organize events, and act as the voice for the startup scene. Currently we are working on a new position paper to be ready by the forthcoming election on 15th October. This is our big project during the summer. Before discussing the key points of the new position paper, a more general question about the Viennese startup scene: Last year, Vienna seemed to fall behind in the race for best location, but now things are looking up. The acquisition of the Viennese startup mySugr by Roche is the largest digital health startup deal in Europe. The city is also a hotspot for chatbot development. Is there a turnaround? Markus: Indeed, a lot happened recently, and in bots development Vienna is one of the top 3 locations worldwide. Among …? Markus: Austin and Berlin. Vienna is at the forefront of things. However, the city has another strength. Vienna has an international reputation as a top location for early-stage startups. In Europe, we have probably the widest range of support programs for company founders. Vienna also has flaws as a startup location. Red tape? Markus: Bureaucracy will be a key point in our new position paper. It will deal specifically with the notary act, trade regulation, which is a real obstacle to many digital business models, and the topic of employee participation. In international startups employees joining the company during the take-off and growth stages usually have share options as part of their salaries. In Austria this is only possible, if at all, by taking contractual detours. Perhaps, a new legal form for startups would be needed. The current situation is enormously disadvantageous when competing internationally. Is this fight for real? Markus: Absolutely. Cities compete for the best startups. Internationally, it is quite common to court a successful startup just like a big corporation. And Vienna? Markus: International startups are not courted the same way as corporations. It is necessary to make founding and the allocation of grants as uncomplicated as possible. A top startup has the same potential to create jobs as a large company. Are you thinking of a specific case? Markus: A frequently discussed example is Spire. (Spire uses nano-satellite technology to locate lost aircrafts or containers). Spire, was successfully established by an Austrian over in the US, and he wanted to set up the European headquarters in Austria. But he finally chose Scotland as a location where he received significantly more financial support. Is it worth investing heavily in startups? Ultimately, many fail. Markus: But those that manage to grow, generate a tremendous dynamic. Looking into the future, some of today’s startups will be among the largest companies in the country. And it is also very important what happens after the startup stage. Runtastic is a good example of this: the founders are key investors in other startups and they share their know-how as mentors. The requirement of the startup scene for tax relief for venture capitalists remains unfulfilled. Written off? Markus: No, this point will definitely be in our new paper. In Austria we have hardly any large-scale financing, because private investors do not have the option to write off losses. In Austria there is enough money available and it would be a pity, if we do not manage to win more investment for startups. The Viennese scene is criticized as too focused on lifestyle. Is there something to this? Markus: This image of the startup scene really annoys me. It does not reflect reality. Building up a company is hard. It takes a lot of hard graft and it is a roller coaster of emotions. One day, you are on top of the world believing that your wonderful idea is all conquering. But it can be all over the next day, because you get a cancellation. To get through that you need a lot of grit and a lot of belief in what you are doing.

"55","https://austrianstartups.com/regierungsprogramm-2020-die-startup-perspektive-2/","AustrianStartups","Das Regierungsprogramm 2020 aus der Startup Perspektive","Gestern wurde das Programm der neuen Bundesregierung vorgestellt – wir haben uns angeschaut, welche Empfehlungen unserer Austrian Startup Agenda es hinein geschafft haben, was es generell für spannende Neuigkeiten für Gründer gibt und welche wichtigen Punkte definitiv fehlen. Generelle Einschätzung Das Regierungsprogramm ist ein großer Schritt in die richtige Richtung und beinhaltet zahlreiche Punkte, die wir schon lange fordern und dringend umgesetzt gehören. Von den 37 Empfehlungen unserer diesjährigen Austrian Startup Agenda finden sich insgesamt 19 im Papier wieder – darunter eine Modernisierung der Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte, konkrete Maßnahmen zur Förderung von Entrepreneurial Education, eine neue digitale Rechtsform für Startups, eine Entlastung des Faktors Arbeit, der Aufbau regulatorischer Sandboxes, Bürokratieabbau bei Förderungen, Steuererleichterungen für Investoren, die Aktivierung institutionellem Kapital aus Pensionskassen sowie eine verstärkte Förderung von Social Entrepreneurship und grünen Technologien. Wir finden die im Programm gezeichnete Vision von Österreich als international führendem Greentech Hotspot großartig. Die besten Visionen sind in der Startup Welt aber nichts wert, wenn die zentralen Maßnahmen nicht rasch umgesetzt werden. In den letzten Jahren haben wir den Anschluss an die führenden europäischen Startup-Hotspots verloren, weil wir es nicht geschafft haben, die PS schnell auf die Straße zu bringen. Dementsprechend lautet diesmal auch unser dringender Appell an die neue Bundesregierung: It’s all about the execution! Wenn wir wirklich in der Champions League mitspielen und eine europäische Vorreiterrolle übernehmen wollen, dann müssen wir die oben angesprochenen zentralen Maßnahmen noch im Jahr 2020 umsetzen – sonst werden andere Länder wieder schneller sein. The Good Folgende Empfehlungen aus der Austrian Startup Agenda haben wir im Regierungsprogramm wieder gefunden. 1) Entrepreneurship Education in allen Pflichtschulen implementieren Entrepreneurship Education: Erarbeitung eines Konzepts, um unternehmerisches Denken im Bildungssystem zu verankern. Z.B. freiwillige „Unternehmerwoche“ ab der Oberstufe, um Berufsbilder und Wirtschaftsbetriebe kennen zu lernen und Zugang zu unternehmerischem Denken zu ermöglichen (s.89) Kooperation von Schulen mit Unternehmen ausbauen (z.B. Unternehmenswoche) (s.87) <U+21D2> Endlich. Am Konzept arbeiten wir schon. 2) Programmier-Unterricht ab der Volksschule einfu¨hren Schülerinnen und Schüler sollen sich in allen Fächern digitaler Technologie für ihren individuellen Lernfortschritt bedienen können. Dazu sollen facheinschlägige Kompetenzen (z.B. Coding/Programmieren) in die betreffenden Lehrpläne eingearbeitet werden. (s. 292) „Digitale Kompetenzen“ werden als Unterrichtsprinzip verankert (s.293) Flächendeckende Evaluierung der „Digitalen Grundbildung“ (s.293) <U+21D2> Hier erhoffen wir uns eine baldige Konkretisierung zur geplanten Einarbeitung in die betreffenden Lehrpläne und eine rasche Reaktion auf die Evaluierungsergebnisse des Masterplan “Digitale Grundbildung”. 3) Gru¨ndungszentren & Entrepreneurship-Fo¨rderung in Hochschulen Auftrag an Hochschulen und Forschungseinrichtungen, um Gründungskulturen und Entrepreneurship-Denken auszubauen. Aufnahme in Leistungsvereinbarungen sowie Fortführung und Ausbau des Programms Spin-Off Fellowships und Stärkung von Female Entrepreneurship (s.313) Schaffung von „Innovation Labs“ an wichtigen Bildungsstandorten und damit Schaffung eines Zugangs für alle Angehörigen der Hochschulen sowie für Lehrlinge und andere Auszubildende zu u.a. Medienlabs, Prototypenfertigung (unter Anleitung von Technikerinnen und Technikern), Arbeitsplätzen und Beratungen (s.324) <U+21D2> Die Aufnahme in die Leistungsvereinbarung ist ein enorm wichtiger Schritt und sollte als Basis dienen, um Incentives für Ausgründungen auf den Fakultäten zu schaffen. 4) Interdisziplina¨re Masterstudienga¨nge & Projektarbeiten fo¨rdern Die Möglichkeit zur Gründung interdisziplinärer Unternehmen erweitern (s.89) Steigerung der Durchlässigkeit zwischen und innerhalb der Hochschulsektoren sowie Optimierung der Anerkennung (auch von Vorleistungen aus nichtakademischen Bildungswegen) – „kein Abschluss ohne Anschluss“ (s.306) <U+21D2> Eine rasche Konkretisierung und Incentivierung der Universitäten wäre hier wünschenswert. 5) Female Entrepreneurship Initiative starten Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zur Stärkung der Rolle von Frauen in der Unternehmerschaft und damit zu spezifischen Förderprogrammen in der Gründungssituation. (s.96) <U+21D2> Gutes Bekenntnis, wir wünschen uns baldige konkrete Maßnahmen. 6) Moderne Rechtsform fu¨r Wachstumsunternehmen einfu¨hren Neue Gesellschaftsform schaffen: Aufbauend auf internationalen Beispielen soll eine neue Kapitalgesellschaftsform geschaffen werden, die besonders fu¨r innovative Startups und Gru¨nderinnen bzw. Gru¨nder in ihrer Fru¨hphase eine international wettbewerbsfa¨hige Option bietet. (s.89) Unbu¨rokratische Gru¨ndung (Stammkapital-Ansparmodelle, digitale Beho¨rdenwege, Englisch als Amtssprache) Flexible Anteilsvergabe an mo¨gliche Investorinnen und Investoren sowie Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter (mit minimalen, digitalen Beho¨rdenwegen) Angepasst an o¨sterreichische Standards (z.B. Transparenz aller Gesellschafterinnen und Gesellschafter) Einsatz auf europa¨ischer Ebene, dass eine einheitliche, zeitgema¨ße Gesellschaftsform fu¨r innovative Start-ups und KMUs EU-weit umgesetzt wird („EU Limited“) (s.89) <U+21D2> Das klingt sehr vielversprechend und wäre ein großer Wurf. Eine unbürokratische digitale Gründung auf Englisch, einfache Mitarbeiterbeteiligung und eine Anwendbarkeit im gesamten EU-Raum würden österreichischen Gründern das Leben definitiv erleichtern. 7) Gru¨ndungsprozess vollsta¨ndig digitalisieren Unbu¨rokratische Gru¨ndung (Stammkapital-Ansparmodelle, digitale Beho¨r- denwege, Englisch als Amtssprache) (s.89) Weiterentwicklung des Unternehmensserviceportals (USP) zu einer umfassenden Plattform für die Interaktion zwischen Unternehmen und Verwaltung (inkl. Förderansuchen etc.) (s.321) <U+21D2> Bereits im Herbst durch die Übergangsregierung umgesetzt worden, wird hier eine weitere Vereinfachung angedacht. 8) Faktor Arbeit durch Einkommenssteuer und Lohnnebenkosten nachhaltig entlasten Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zu einer Entlastung der Menschen in Österreich. Um Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer, Pensionistinnen und Pensionisten, Selbständige sowie Land- und Forstwirte insbesondere mit geringen und mittleren Einkommen spürbar zu entlasten, sollen die erste, zweite und dritte Stufe des Einkommensteuertarifs reduziert werden: von 25% auf 20%, 35% auf 30% und 42% auf 40% (s.77) Prüfung der Potenziale zur Senkung der Lohnnebenkosten ohne Leistungsreduktion (s.81) <U+21D2> Die Lohnnebenkostensenkung war noch in jedem Regierungsprogramm dabei (und wurde trotzdem nie umgesetzt), aber ein konkreter Plan für die Senkung der Einkommenssteuer ist erfreulich – hier müssen wir als Standort insgesamt wettbewerbsfähiger werden und das wäre ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung. 9) Sandboxes fu¨r disruptive Gescha¨ftsfelder einfu¨hren Regulatory Sandboxes umsetzen: Innovative Technologien, Produkte und Dienstleistungen sollen in ihrer Fru¨hphase mit Blick auf europa¨ische und internationale Entwicklungen in einem wettbewerbsneutralen Rahmen, der nach objektiven Kriterien ausgestaltet ist, erprobt werden ko¨nnen, wenn ihre Anwendung sonst rechtlich nicht gedeckt ist (z.B. innovative Startups/KMUs, die neue Gescha¨ftsmodelle, Technologien, Dienstleistungen oder Produkte vertreiben wollen, die sich durch die bestehende Gewerbeordnung nicht abdecken lassen). Dabei soll es zu enger Zusammenarbeit mit der zusta¨ndigen Aufsichtsbeho¨rde kommen, um das betroffene Modell zu testen und zu adaptieren. Ab einem bestimmten Reifegrad (zeitlich bestimmt oder durch Unternehmensgro¨ße) soll ein U¨bergang ins regula¨re Gewerbesystem stattfinden. (s.89) <U+21D2> Wichtige Initiative, die in England im Fintech-Bereich sehr gut gegriffen hat und über die wir schon lange reden. Umso wichtiger ist eine schnelle Umsetzung. 10) Beteiligungsfreibetrag fu¨r Startup-Investoren einfu¨hren Prüfung einer steuerlichen Absetzbarkeit von Anschub- und Wachstumsfinanzie- rung für innovative Start-ups und KMUs mit Obergrenze pro Investment (z.B. € 100.000 über 5 Jahre absetzbar) und einer Gesamtdeckelung – nach Vorbild des er- folgreichen (Seed) Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS/EIS) in Großbritannien. (s.97) <U+21D2> Das hier erst mal nur “geprüft” werden soll ist etwas besorgniserregend. Das Modell gibt es seit Jahren als Best Practice und wurde schon mehrmals für eine Umsetzung in Österreich angedacht. Unsere Empfehlung: Dementsprechend schnell prüfen und noch dieses Jahr umsetzen – Großbritannien hat die positiven Effekte gezeigt. 11) Fondsbesteuerung klarstellen und modernisieren Start-up und KMU-Finanzierung: Um den österreichischen Standort und vor allem die Gründung neuer Unternehmen mit innovativen Ideen (inkl. Social Entrepreneurship) und deren Wachstum zu fördern soll privates Risikokapital mobilisiert werden, z.B. durch die Einführung und Lockerung der Verlustverrechnungsmöglichkeit bei Einkünften aus Kapitalvermögen. Aktuell können private Investorinnen und Investoren Verluste aus der Beteiligung an Startups nur mit bestimmten positiven Kapitaleinkünften und nur im gleichen Jahr ausgleichen – zukünftig soll die Verlustverrechnung auch über mehrere Jahre hinweg erfolgen können. (s.97) <U+21D2> Endlich. Wichtiger Schritt um Startup Investments für Investoren attraktiver zu machen. 12) Stiftungen & Pensionskassen Investitionen im Startup-Bereich ermöglichen Institutionelle Investoren, wie Pensionskassen, Vorsorgekassen und Versicherungen sollen in langfristige, innovative Anlageformen (inkl. ökologischem und Social Impact) investieren dürfen (z.B. Seed-Finanzierung für Start-Ups und KMUs). Die zugrundeliegenden Kataloge zulässiger Veranlagungen sollen entsprechend angepasst werden (in Einklang mit EU-Recht). (s.97) Reform und Attraktivierung des Privatstiftungsrechts im internationalen Vergleich unter Stärkung der Begünstigtenstellung (s.32) <U+21D2> Jawoll! Bei den Stiftungen sollte man noch etwas konkreter werden, aber die Pensionskassen sind ein riesen Schritt, um Wachstumskapital aus Österreich zu mobilisieren und die gesamte Gesellschaft an den Digitalisierungsgewinnen teilhaben zu lassen. 13) Dachfond zur Wachstumsfinanzierung errichten Aufbau eines nationalen staatlich kofinanzierten Technologie-, Innovations- und Wachstums-Fonds, der Risikokapital zur Verfügung stellt und so die nachhaltige Etablierung von europäischen Schlüsseltechnologien unterstützt (aufbauend auf bestehende Mittelstands- und Gründerfonds) (s. 323) Ausbau der Verfügbarkeit von Wachstumskapital für Start-Ups und KMUs (Finanzierungsvolumen € 2 Mio. bis € 20 Mio.) in Zusammenarbeit mit privaten Investorinnen und Investoren. Mögliche internationale Beispiele wären z.B. Modell Schweiz (Corporate Venture Fund unter Einbindung österreichischer Leitbetriebe) oder Modell Dänemark (Dachfonds/Fund of Funds Lösung). (s.97) <U+21D2> Wichtiger Punkt, Umsetzung ist entscheidend – Agilität und ausreichende Kapitalausstattung sind entscheidend, um auch international eine Rolle zu spielen. 14) Entscheidungsstrukturen bei Förderungen beschleunigen & transparenter gestalten Planungssicherheit und Bürokratieabbau bei Förderungen (z.B. Entscheidung über Förderanträge innerhalb definierter Fristen, objektive Wirkungsziele, Abwicklungskooperationen von Bund und Ländern) (s. 92) <U+21D2> Sehr gut, bitte rasch umsetzen und Fristen ambitioniert setzen. 15) Social Entrepreneurship nachhaltig fo¨rdern Zielgruppenspezifische öffentliche Finanzierungsinstrumente bzw. Ausweitung und Öffnung bestehender Finanzierungsprogramme für Social Entrepreneurs (s.98) Prüfung einer Reform der Gemeinnützigkeitsbestimmung durch Ausweitung auf Social Entrepreneurs (s.98) <U+21D2> Absolut sinnvoll. 16) Fo¨rderbonus fu¨r Teams mit weiblichen Gru¨ndern fla¨chendeckend einfu¨hren Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zur Stärkung der Rolle von Frauen in der Unternehmerschaft und damit zu spezifischen Förderprogrammen in der Gründungssituation. (s.96) <U+21D2> Konkretisierung wünschenswert. 17) Professionelles Standort-Marketing starten Den Erfolg österreichischer Unternehmen auf ausländischen Märkten stärken und ausbauen: Alle bestehenden Bemühungen in der Außenwirtschaft – von den Ministerien, von Branchenvertreterinnen bzw. -vertretern und privaten Initiativen – künftig noch besser koordinieren (s.90) Aktive Bewerbung des Standorts Österreich im Ausland, durch verstärkte Zusammenarbeit aller relevanten Stellen des Wirtschafts- und Außenministeriums, sowie der Wirtschaftskammer Österreich (s.90) Ausrichtung der ABA-Unit „Work in Austria“ als zentrale Plattform für die Anwerbung von Spezialistinnen und Spezialisten aus dem Ausland (s.87) <U+21D2> Die Bündelung der Koordination durch eine Organisation macht Sinn. Bitte dabei nicht auf die speziellen Bedürfnisse von Startups vergessen – enger Austausch mit Gründern macht hier Sinn. 18) Wettbewerbsfa¨hige Rot-Weiß-Rot Card fu¨r Startups einfu¨hren Rot-Weiß-Rot-Karte (RWR-Karte) reformieren: Konsolidierung des gesetzlichen Rahmens, One-Stop-Shop bei der Austrian Business Agency, Antragstellung vereinfachen, Verfahren straffen, Senkung von Gehaltsgrenzen (s.87) <U+21D2> Yes! Das klingt vielversprechend. Bitte jetzt wirklich ambitioniert sein und keine halben Sachen machen. Berlin schafft eine Antwort binnen 5 Werktagen, Frankreich gibt überhaupt Kontingente frei – jede Verbesserung ist gut, für echte Wettbewerbsfähigkeit müssen wir uns aber an den internationalen Best Practices orientieren. 19) Regionale Startup Cluster fo¨rdern und international profilieren Auf Stärken bauen: Bestehende Stärken wie z.B. die Mobilitätsindustrie, erneuerbare Energien und Umwelttechnik, Biotechnologie, Mikroelektronik, Landwirt- schaft, Tourismus und andere müssen weiter ausgebaut, weiterentwickelt und durch gemeinsame Bemühungen der Wirtschaft und der Politik international beworben werden. (s.88) <U+21D2> Sinnvoll, internationale Bewerbung ist definitiv noch ausbaufähig. The Bad Wenn alle oben angeführten Punkte schnell umgesetzt werden, dann ist das schon ein riesiger Schritt für die österreichische Wettbewerbsfähigkeit im Bereich Innovation, Technologie und Startups. Trotzdem gibt es ein paar Punkte aus der Austrian Startup Agenda, die wir im neuen Regierungsprogramm besonders schmerzlich vermissen: 1) Trend Monitoring für zukunftsfitte Lehrinhalte Unser Bildungssystem ist zu träge – derzeit implementieren wir gerade die Änderungen, die wir schon vor 20 Jahren hätten einführen müssen, anstatt uns mit den Anforderungen des Arbeitsmarkts der Zukunft zu beschäftigen. Wir hoffen, dass die neue Bundesregierung das erkennt und unserem Ruf nach einem Rat fu¨r zukunftsfitte Bildung, der durch kontinuierliches Technologie- und Trend Monitoring ja¨hrlich Empfehlungen fu¨r neue Lehrinhalte auf allen Bildungs-Levels gibt, doch noch nachkommt. 2) Gewerberecht ins 21. Jahrhundert bringen Bei den letzten Regierungsprogrammen war die dringend notwendige Reform der Gewerbeordnung stets enthalten, wurde am Ende aber nie sinnvoll umgesetzt. Es ist traurig, dass die bestehenden Marktteilnehmer hier scheinbar erfolgreich für eine Beibehaltung der zumeist protektionistischen Auflagen lobbyiert haben. Um Unternehmertum in Österreich wirklich zu erleichtern braucht es hier entweder eine komplette Neuordnung nach sinnvollen Kriterien, oder zumindest eine Befreiung für Jungunternehmen in den ersten Jahren. 3) Förderprozesse flexibilisieren Es ist gut und wichtig, dass sich die neue Bundesregierung vorgenommen hat das Fördersystem zu entbürokratisieren. Um Förderungen allerdings wirklich attraktiv für Startups zu machen, ist eine Flexibilisierung der Förderprozesse mindestens ebenso wichtig. Innovative Jungunternehmen leben von ihrer Fähigkeit schnell und unkompliziert auf Marktfeedback zu reagieren – wenn diese Agilität durch rigide Förderrichtlinien zu Grunde geht, dann verlieren Förderungen schnell ihre positive Wirkung. Hier sollte also unbedingt noch nachgebessert werden. 4) Startup Visum auf Schiene bringen Mit der dringend notwendigen Reform der Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte setzt die neue Regierung einen wichtigen Schritt, um Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen die besten Mitarbeiter nach Österreich zu holen. Gleichzeitig haben sich Türkis und Grün zum Ziel gesetzt auch die besten Unternehmer anzulocken (…wollen wir uns in Zukunft koordiniert dafür einsetzen, internationale Unternehmensansiedlungen … für den Standort Österreich zu gewinnen., s.88). Um diesem Ziel gerecht zu werden, wird auch eine Reform des sogenannten Startup Visums notwendig sein, das in den vergangenen Jahren durch viel zu strikte Kriterien und ausufernde Bürokratie ganze 3 Mal vergeben wurde. 5) Unabha¨ngigen Startup Beirat einberufen Bei aller Zuversicht vermissen wir ein Element ganz besonders – die nachhaltige Verankerung der innovativen Gründer-Perspektive in öffentlichen und politischen Institutionen. Besonders in der Startup-Welt, in der Veränderung die einzige Konstante ist, macht ein regelmäßig festgesetzter Dialog mit Experten aus der Praxis viel Sinn, um Pläne laufend zu aktualisieren. Unser Vorschlag: Ein unabhängiger Startup-Beirat der die Regierung bei Tech-Agenden unterstützt und direkt Feedback zu geplanten Initiativen gibt. The Noteworthy Auch mit 37 Empfehlungen deckt unsere Austrian Startup Agenda nur einen Teil des notwendigen Reformbedarfs in Österreich ab. Deshalb freuen wir uns, dass es auch einige weitere Punkte im Regierungsprogramm gibt, die aus einer Startup-Perspektive spannend scheinen: Österreich als Greentech Hotspot Neue Sektoren erschließen: Entstehende Sta¨rken, in denen O¨sterreich relevante Wettbewerbsvorteile aufweist, mu¨ssen vor dem Hintergrund der Technologieneutralita¨t weiterentwickelt werden, O¨sterreichs internationales Profil darin gesta¨rkt und durch o¨sterreichische Produkte weltweit ein Beitrag zur CO2-Reduktion geleistet werden – wie z.B. digitale Gescha¨ftsmodelle, forschungsintensive Industrien, Modelle der Kreislaufwirtschaft, die E-Mobilita¨t, die Nutzung von gru¨nem Wasserstoff in Verkehr und Industrie, Gesundheitswirtschaft und andere Bereiche, die auf O¨sterreichs Verbindung von Grundlagenforschung, angewandter Forschung und industriellem Know-how bauen.

"56","https://austrianstartups.com/set-records-straight/","AustrianStartups","Setting the records straight","When I saw the cover of one of Austria’s leading business magazines on the weekend, I was intrigued. With big letters, it read, “Startups are bombarded with grant-millions, traditional SMEs are left in the lurch”. Taking into account that the recent government startup package of €185 million seems minimal in comparison to the more than €19 billion of grants offered by the state of Austria in general, I was wondering whether they knew of any new initiatives. They do not. Instead, the respective story includes several unsatisfied SME founders complaining about the alleged startup love by the government. One of them is actually quoted saying that because of the large amounts of public money, “startup founders don’t know sleepless nights, or how it feels to hit the bottom and get up again”. At that point, I got really irritated. Did he ever make the effort to come by at a startup and experience their reality firsthand before making such comments? He would have found out that no substantial grant is paid out without the founder adding significant private contributions. Every single startup founder would tell him about their personal rollercoaster ride and those sleepless nights. His comment is so far off the mark that it is difficult to take it seriously. Still, I believe that, as a community, we can learn a lot from this article. I am convinced that the increased public awareness about startups is ultimately positive. We desperately need more entrepreneurial spirit and enthusiasm about innovative new technologies in Austria and for that startups need to be present. However, when I read the lines above, it’s clear that this hype has also lead to some misunderstandings. It seems that considerable groups of our society have an unrealistic image of startups. To put it bluntly, in their worldview, startups are a bunch of hipsters playing foosball and living off grant money. Now some of you might say, “let’s not care what people think of us – we will do our thing with or without public support”. But I believe this is not just about keeping political support to further improve conditions for startups – this is also about the talent pool at our hands. We will only be able to attract more of the right people to found or work in startups if the public starts to understand what startups are really about. I believe we currently have a small window of opportunity to position ourselves as an international hub for innovative young companies and I’m not willing to let such misunderstandings get in the way. It will be the job of us, the community, to set the record straight. For that, we need to insert more facts into the public discussion. As already explained above, the startup package is only very small in comparison to the complete grant volume of Austria – considering the wide-ranging positive effects of innovative entrepreneurship (know-how, jobs, and economic competitiveness), probably too small. And yet, many people seem to have the impression that startups are bombarded by public money and everyone else is left behind. To change that, we finally need to get reliable data about our ecosystem and use those findings to educate the public about the realities of Austrian startups and why it makes sense to improve conditions for them. This is our aim with the Think Tank project we are working on – to finally move the basis of these discussions from gut feelings to facts. Last but not least, it will also be our job to help mainstream media outlets portray startups in a more realistic way. People need to understand that founding or working in a startup is not about becoming a millionaire while playing foosball. It is incredibly tough and comes with the ever-present risk of personal failure. But it also enables you to have an impact and grow massively on a personal level. It will be our job to tell the right stories to better communicate that. To quote my fellow AustrianStartups colleague Daniel Cronin, “not just shiny success stories but stories showing how true success is created: grit and determination as well as bloody hard work”.

If no one is paying for it, your product will never fly off the shelves. This month’s Stammtisch was all about customers. Finding them, keeping them and loving them. Actively Pursue Your Customers No customers, no company. Call potential customers and convince them, that your startup is the right fit. Consistency is key, especially in the beginning. Don’t give up and don’t go in unprepared. Stalk them on Facebook if you have to. And be ready to put on your (sales) boots and leave your desk. Networking and talking to people is equally important when it comes to getting the word out and potential feedback in. Customer development is not just about selling your product, it’s learning about the needs of your potential future customers. Don’t be Afraid of your Customers, learn from them! The idea of interacting with potential customers might be scary at the beginning. But especially at the early stages, where you’re probably not going to have a sales team, you’ll have to interact with customers. And those customers will tell you what they don’t like. But that’s a good thing! Get as much (viable) feedback as you can and adapt appropriately. After all, your product is for them. Love Your Customers Closing customers is one thing, but keeping them is a whole other story. Satisfied customers are your long-term goal. Listen to their complaints, find out what their needs are, and always treat them like a valued partner. Dedicated customer support will never go unnoticed. Document Everything and Learn About Your Customers To grow your customer base also means to keep track of what went right and what went wrong when interacting with them. It’s never too early to start with that. Know how you can reach them, what works for them and change your next sales approach accordingly. Different regions, cultures and industries will require different approaches or even different product features. The key to that is documenting every sales related interaction down to every single text message. It may seem tedious but it will be worth it at the end. So that’s how you build and expand your customer basis. Call them, text and stalk them, love them. Present your product consistently; Try, test, learn, document and refine all the time and the customers will follow.

Get as much feedback as you can as early as you can Don’t be afraid of someone stealing your ideas. Share them with people inside and outside of the industry. Listen to what they have to say. Having an extra set of eyes —or five— giving feedback will always benefit you and outweighs the potential risk of someone “stealing” your ideas any day. There are going to be a lot of people with the exact same idea out there anyway. Proper execution is what will set you apart from your competitors, bringing us to the next key requirement when launching a startup. A good team is everything Having a good idea is only half the battle. Turning your idea into a functioning company will require a team that works well together — both personality and skill-wise. Always keep that in mind when recruiting. An impressive CV doesn’t automatically mean great social skills — a key ingredient when it comes to sales staff for example. And don’t neglect your gut feeling when talking to potential future employees. If it doesn’t feel right, it usually won’t work out down the road. Trust yourself but stay realistic Thinking big is what entrepreneurs do. And having a vision of what could be can be great motivation. Commit to your vision. Learn everything you can possibly learn to help realize that vision. But also stay realistic. Know what you and your team can and cannot do. Overestimating one’s own success and capacities is one of the main reasons young startups fail. Ask yourself the right questions Before doing anything else, you should ask yourself some questions: Why do I want to start a company? So why do you? Think about why you want to launch your own startup. Some people tend to think launching a startup is easy money. It’s not. It’s long hours and sleepless nights but it’s something you create and form yourself. It’ll require you to learn and adapt fast to overcome new challenges every day. If that sounds like something you can endure and enjoy, don’t waste any time and go for it. Who do I want to work with? This cannot be stressed enough. Think about what you need from your team. Right now and in the future. And then hire accordingly. Your team members need to have an open mindset, the ability to work with others and need to be able to adapt fast. The right skill set is key. Don’t be afraid to say no to potential applicants. What do I Want to Achieve in the Long run? Think about where you want to go with your idea, what you want to achieve. What could be your potential impact? Don’t overthink, but have a clear vision where you want to go. That’s it for this Stammtisch. Don’t be afraid to launch your own startup, but don’t be stupid about it either. See you at the next Stammtisch.

"59","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-56-how-to-build-a-kickass-founding-team/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #56: How to build a kickass founding team","You’ve got an amazing idea? That’s great, congratulations! But do you also have the team it takes to make this idea successful? Are there specific indicators you should look for in potential co-founders? What about your first employees? And what happens to your own sanity when the company grows? That – and much more – was discussed at Stammtisch #56. Let’s just say, there is no right or wrong here – judging from the heated discussion between Rhina Portillo, Cozyo, Jakob Reiter, TheVentury and Matthias Blazanovic, bikemap. First, there is an idea. A little, tiny idea. You talk about it, dream about what would happen if it became reality. It’s all fun and games until reality strikes in the form of questions asked considering the movement and structure. “Are we really doing this? NOW?” “What are the next steps?” “Who is taking care of X, Y and Z?” The Marriage metaphor Co-founding is comparable to marriage. You will spend an awful lot of time with your co-founder(s). You will very soon share financial issues. You will fly high together and, but also crash together – and hopefully don’t burn – together. As we can read about past founding stories and also have heard at our last Stammtisch. There will be fights to be fought and there will be struggles ahead. But you will also motivate and pick each other up when it is needed. Our lesson learned this time: You should really take time to pick your co-founder wisely, because, as our one and only Daniel Cronin put it: “You don’t marry the first person you meet either, right?” Friends or Strangers? Founding with friends or strangers? Sure, founding with friends is great when everything’s rainbows and butterflies, but can you handle disagreements and fights as well without taking it personal? And do you complement each other? Are there skills needed in the founding team, that none of you have? Here you should choose wisely and rather focus on hard and soft skills incorporated by the person needed than simply personal emotional connection. However, you don’t always have the luxury of being picky (In need of a CTO, anybody?). But you can build a great founding team without even having met in person before incorporating the company – as Jakob Reiter remembers from founding his first company. Skype was a sufficient way to meet and the team has moved on to founding several companies together by now. What it comes down to is one question: Can we go through tough times together as well as the happy ones? Or, as Rhina puts it “Is this a person I would share financial problems with?” Friends or no friends, make sure you have contracts in order from the beginning. “You want to draw the papers up in case worst comes to worst, but then you never want to look at them again – hopefully” as Jakob says. Because of course, everything is exciting and everybody is happy doing this together in the beginning, but sometimes, things happen. And you want to be on the safe side, in case they do. You might not save the friendship but the business. Hacker, Hipster, Hustler Diversity in the founding team is one of the most important things, our panelists agree. “More often than not, you are surrounded by people who all have the same background, but what you actually need are other – complementary – skill sets in your team. And these are hard to find, sometimes”, as Matthias knows from experience. If you want to follow the “Holy Trinity of Founding Teams”, make sure your team consists of a hacker (again, CTO, anybody?), a hipster – somebody who loves the product, takes care of the UX and knows what the user needs – and a hustler – the manager in the team who takes care of the finances and all that great stuff. Easy, right? So, what makes a great co-founder? Great question! Not so easy to answer! After all, judging from the completely different answers we got to this question. Among others, honesty is an important characteristic. Picking somebody with a complimentary skill set to yours is something you should always keep in mind, too. And going with the financial theme: co-found with somebody who thinks about money the same way you do. But with all these rational decisions, don’t forget about a little craziness either: pick somebody who is just as passionate about making the business happen as you are and join in the craziness together.

"60","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-57-how-startups-can-change-the-world-for-the-better/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #57:  How startups can change the world for the better","Tanking place last Tuesday at Impact Hub Vienna, Stammtisch #57 was all about Social Entrepreneurship. Hannah Lux (Vollpension), Frederik Debong (mysugr) and Peter Vandor (WU Vienna) discussed how startups can change the world for better. And let us tell you this, there are many ways they can! Social Entrepreneurs “Why would I found a business if I didn’t have the goal to change the world for better?” Hannah Lux drops a bomb with her first commentary of the night. And shows that social entrepreneurs are intrinsically motivated to follow a strong mission. A mission to have a positive impact on this planet – on a smaller or bigger scale. With this strong mission come tough decisions, though. Well, according to our podium guests, it’s not about “taking the easy way, it’s taking the way with more impact”. Measuring Impact Speaking of taking the road with more impact, the question arises: How do you properly measure impact? In a world of KPI’s and data-driven everything, how can we prove – with numbers – that impact is being made? “There is a whole industry focusing on this topic”, says Peter Vandor. “If I see people from all ages connecting with each other in a natural environment – when I see people blossoming in this environment – I know I have made an impact”, adds Hannah Lux. But is impact the only way to measure success in social businesses? Is the trade-off of being social not being economically successful? Is it just a nice dream of naive people who think they can actually change this planet? A hundred percent not. If anything, running a successful social business is way harder than a common profit-driven company. Because it has to be social AND a business. It has to have an impact while still being economically sound. Mission Drift What happens, though, when the venture gets bigger? When partners are coming on board or the company goes public? That’s the moment it gets harder and harder to prioritize having an impact. Mission drift is – in many cases – bound to happen. As soon as more stakeholders get involved, it’s easy to lose sight of what you set out to do in the first place. The company becomes a balance sheet and it’s all about investors and their return. “To avoid mission drift, you have to work on it from the beginning. Making sure the mission is ingrained in the team”, says Peter Vandor. And even when selling the company to a huge corporate, it’s possible to stay true to your mission, as Frederik and mysugr show: “Before selling, we made sure everything was going to stay the same. To have the same people making decisions. The same team. The same mission. And nobody is contractually forced to stay.” Love it or leave it. What’s left to say is this: It’s on you – don’t say “I wish somebody would make the world a better place”. YOU can make the world a better place. See you all at next month’s Stammtisch – #58, where you can tell us about how YOU want to make the world a better place, and find out how to score an investment at the same time. Shoutout to Hanna, Frederik and Peter for being part of April’s Stammtisch and inspiring us to have an impact!

"61","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-58-private-investors/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #58: Private Investors","Anyone who has thought of creating their own business will stumble upon one major obstacle: funding. “How do I finance my startup?” is a question founders have to ask themselves no matter if they plan to start today, tomorrow or in ten years. While it’s important to consider that many successful startups managed to finance their growth through bootstrapping (only relying on existing resources), there are just as many cases in which more money is needed from the beginning. Especially if there is a race to a market and you need to grow quickly, working with external investors makes sense. One option for getting external financing on board is through a business angel, venture capitalist or other forms of private investment. Don’t wait for the investor to come If you want to get an external investor on board, it’s important not to simply “take money from anybody.” There will be unforeseeable ups and downs that accompany the founding process. So, make sure that the investor by your side is someone you respect and trust. Christoph Schnedlitz, CEO and co-founder of hiMoment recalls, “the first round of investment is the easiest and most difficult at the same time: You have to honestly show what you have to get investment, BUT you also have very little to show”. So, what can you actually put on display? Obviously, you need to show the very little you have in a very grand manner. Christoph says in order to do this convincingly: “You need a storyteller”. Most of the time, business angels don’t take you in before you’ve proven yourself and your business idea. This means, you must have reached a so-called “pre-stage” to actually attract an investor. To use business angel Hansi Hansmann’s words, “this means that you should have proven your business model to yourself for the first 6-12 months”. However, to do so, financial resources are necessary. Here, most recommend to go for the “3 F’s” (= Friends, Family and Fools), but, you might want to look into government grants and programs like “UGP”, as well. Finishing your first round of funding takes 6-8 months on average, according to Christoph. It’s a long process that you will want to have prepared for accordingly. You need deadlines and a, seemingly, never-ending calendar of events and people to talk to. “Know what you do, and who you need to talk to, and please keep careful track of your cap table!“ Hansi’s advice: Calculate how much money you need in the next 12-18 months and then derive the valuation of the company from this. Give away max 15-20% per round, ideally less. Have a viable business plan and know how much funding assistance you need, in addition be able to communicate what you need the assistance for. When you meet these prerequisites, it is time to start looking for investors. Be prepared and keep in mind that “you may need to speak to hundreds of investors before you find the right one for your startup” What they want – the power of FOMO Hansi expects his founders to have at least 3 different pitches very well prepared: one 10-15 second version – just to get attention; another one lasting 2 minutes, and a longer one (5-7 minutes). He stresses that there’s “normally one person in the team, who is the best presenter. So, let him/her rock the stage.” When interviewing for her Fund of Excellence, Natalia Corrales-Diez, goes through a 40-minute assessment with her applicants. This includes going through 750 criteria that calibrate to define a so-called “street fighter”. The assessment includes the participant’s vision, values and his/her “Plan B”. There is one approach Hansi personally advises against: “Don’t ever ask an investor to give you money directly. Just pitch how great what you want to do is. Everybody knows it’s only about money, anyways.” Also, investors are very susceptible to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Investors are quite insecure and don’t want to miss out on the next big thing – use this to your advantage! hiMoment, for example, created a special newsletter to spread the “feeling that there’s really something happening”. They made sure, their marketing channel was FULL of success stories, and even developed their own language by creating a new coaching framework. Christoph says, “you need to find a language to express what it is that you’re trying to sell them and make them like it.” The real asset is you Having a kickass team is not sufficient, though. When it comes to money you need to fulfill certain requirements. Even having a balanced team with experienced founders, operating in big markets with a great product, clear direction and revenue does not automatically make it easy to get money. You also have to get this information to the investor AND make him/her believe in you. For Hansi, it’s a balance of capabilities, a motivated team and at least one entrepreneur who is willing to go through a lot of frustration. In short, be amazing! Christoph’s key to success, for example, lies in selling. He believes in “sales power” – a fire in the eyes and a vision that’s tangible. For Natalia, the decisive factor is clearly individual: “We invest in a person. It’s only about your personality.” Big thanks again to firestarters.space. – an architecturally impressive new co-working space in Vienna – for having us! And, big shout out to our marvelous panel Christoph Schnedlitz (Co-Founder & CEO – hiMoment), Natalia Corrales-Diez (Managing Director – Fund of Excellence), and Hansi Hansmann (Business Angel) for a diverse and thrilling discussion.

"62","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-61-bootstrapping/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #61: Bootstrapping","Bootstrapping. Some call it the holy grail of building a startup, others don’t even know what it means. So before we tell you about all the insights from our Stammtisch #61, let’s take a look at how businessdictionary.com understands bootstrapping: “Building a business out of very little or virtually nothing. Boot strappers rely usually on personal income and savings, sweat equity, lowest possible operating costs, fast inventory turnaround, and a cash-only approach to selling. Many of today’s largest corporations (such as Apple computer, Clorox Co., Coca Cola, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft) began as boot-strapped ventures.” So basically, bootstrapping means taking no outside capital and funding your business solely with your personal finances and your company’s first incomes. Sounds hard? It definitely is. However, there is a lot to it, according to our awesome panelists, Claudia Eder (tubics), Klaus Furtmüller (jobrocker and jobiqo) and Peter Steinberger (PSPDFKit). Why bootstrap? First things first – why should you consider bootstrapping? For many it’s a question of principle – not taking in any outside investment also means not giving away equity – the company stays truly yours. But Bootstrapping also means focusing on what should be at the core of every business – creating value for the customers. Since you need your customers to buy the product or service as soon as possible you’re extremely focused on making something people love and will pay for. Klaus Furthmüller put it like this: “You’ll learn how to make money”. When to bootstrap? As just discussed, one of the big advantages of bootstrapping is that you’re forced to focus on customer needs and development, building a great MVP, building something your customers will love and get value out of. There is no other way since you need to make money and making money depends on whether the customers like your product or not. Claudia calls this the “guiding star of bootstrapping”. In theory, we know that virtually every business should focus on this. But the reality often looks different. When Peter’s previous company scored an investment in the beginning, the team spent an entire year building a product before they started market testing. When not to bootstrap? As everything, bootstrapping has its downsides, too. One of them is that everything relies on you – and your co-founders, if you have some. Most likely, there is no money to hire a team in the beginning, so you have to do everything yourself, even the parts you are not good at or don’t enjoy that much. Additionally, you might not be able to grow as fast as you would like to. As Claudia says “Bootstrapped companies who have scaled without taking any investment have my biggest admiration”. So, after having bootstrapped successfully for a while and having built your first customer base, some might decide to look for an investment. In the end… As always, there is no right or wrong, when starting a startup. But focussing on your customers and getting them to show that they are willing to pay for your product will hardly be a mistake. What kind of learnings did you take away from Stammtisch 61? Do you have any questions? Let us know and we will forward them to our experts from the panel! Thank you all for this great discussion and evening!

"63","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-63-hiring-internationally/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #63: Hiring Internationally","For Stammtisch #63 we discussed hiring internationally – a topic that has many different perspectives that need to be considered and a topic, that plays an important role for startups from the beginning We welcomed Sead Ahmetovic from WeAreDevelopers, Felix Häusler from Grape, Anna Iarotska from Robo Wunderkind and Christoph Bitzner from TheVentury. Why hiring internationally? Hiring internationally in general can have many different reasons. Maybe you want to increase your talent pool, or want to find people with specific technical skills, that are not easy to find in your country. Like Sead said, they see a lack of talent within Austria, especially when it comes to developers. Christoph agrees, “especially growth hackers are not easy to find here”. In his opinion, internationally talent is necessary to have a broader perspective and different opinions that lead a business to success. One of his “Aha” moments at TheVentury was when they hired a prior lawyer- now developer, who approached technical issues in a completely different way, which enabled totally new solutions and the development of new processes. Austria is a small market and in order to scale you need international experience and knowledge. By hiring only people from your country, you’ll keep a specific mindset within the company and therefore might overlook potential strategies and business opportunities in different markets. You need to look “over the Austrian Tellerrand”. International people all have a different cultural background. Culture is a powerful tool to success, that shapes not only working behavior and relationships, but also the enjoyment of work itself. It’s made out of all experiences, backgrounds and skills your employees bring to the table and will influence the environment you’re working in on a daily basis. What does it need to be hired internationally? When a company decides to hire an employee from overseas there are different things to pay attention to. You’re not only looking into technical skill sets of potential candidates. After all, our panel agreed, you can train them on the job and introduce them to company processes. It’s a broader skill set that you’re looking for- highlighted Christoph. At TheVentury potential candidates need to bring the right skill set, culture and passion to the table. Felix thinks that if somebody took the risk and chance to actually go to another country and work abroad, he or she- most of the time- has inevitably a better set of soft skills. “For us it’s not only about knowledge, but about increasing diversity and therefore success.” According to this article, divers teams can help a company to be 35% more likely, to have returns over their industry’s median. Remote or not? There are successful startups and companies out there that work mostly or even completely remotely – indeed there’s a whole database of such startups. Still, our panelists found remote work difficult and rather like their international employees within the country and favourably in the same room. “It’s way easier to coordinate and communicate with each other”, Felix relates, “because at some point it wasn’t possible to schedule any meetings with the whole team- having more than five different time zones to take into account”. This also made it more difficult to keep people. In some areas it’s simply necessary, e.g. product development and sales- they really need to understand the product. Anna, who’s company has offices in Austria and Asia thinks “there should always be someone on the ground”. Christoph found it difficult to build the same connection and relation even though they would stay connected over laptops, video chats etc. over the whole working day. But at WeAreDevelopers Sead realised that once you grow at a certain speed, hiring remote workers becomes more and more necessary. Bigger companies lose a lot of ground/money/projects if they do not manage to find fitting talent quickly enough. Allowing people to live wherever they want and work remotely can enlarge your talent pool dramatically. Challenges along the way of hiring internationally During our panel discussion we noted three big challenges when hiring internationally Language Barriers: According to Anna, Asia and the US are the biggest markets for international potentials, but especially with Chinese people they experienced high language barriers. She recalls that “there were many misunderstandings”. Regulations: This point stood out. All four panelists had, at some points, difficulties with getting people into Austria, or, even more often, keeping them here. All panelists recall difficulties getting so called “Rot-Weiß-Rot Karten” for employees (a working visa for 24 month). Felix said, they basically have a lawyer now to get through the proceedings more quickly, because they already lost an employee. “He had a small family, a wife and a kid. When they finally got the extension of their papers, they already needed to start the process for the next extension. So they decided to leave, because it was just too dangerous for them to have their kid taken from school one day by the police.” Sead also pointed out that a percentage of developers doesn’t even have a degree, therefore they might not even fit the criteria. And Anna added that only for a 10-weeks stay you already need a working permit. Taxes: Both, Anna and Christoph experienced high potentials turning down great job offers, because of high taxes in relation to their home country. In Anna’s case, the guy went back home, saying, he’s not interested in paying that much taxes. In Christoph’s case, the guy stayed, because the company explained and communicated all the taxes and basic insurance terms and their benefits. One positive point that is noteworthy though, is that the EU makes it possible to have access to over 500 million people that don’t need ANY visa! Startups love the EU! How to actually hire them? The experiences and opinions vary at this question. Grape is looking into hiring people from the Ukraine and Brasil, they focus on the youngest generation. The Ventury posts job ads in English. “So, if an international person is already interested, we can catch them.” RoboWunderkind is looking actively at people on LinkedIn and approaches them directly. At WeAreDevelopers it depends on the position you’re looking to fill, but they also rely on active sourcing and use social communities. In order to make international teams work effectively together, there are many different approaches: Structure, goals, rituals (according to Anna) A catchy onboarding process and actively spent time together out of the office, like company events (Christoph) Felix relies on having a special person within the team that new employees can connect to, take them to many events like AustrianStartups Stammtisch and other communities like Metropole Why work in Austria?

"64","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-76-embracing-failure/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #76 Embracing Failure","To start with, why is failing important? Failure is not black and white: although it might hurt, it can also provide valuable insights. Failing is important as a record of your actions: you define the reasons of a failure and you learn from it (e.g. bad luck?, bad decisions?). Entrepreneurship after all is an iteration process. Do not forget that 90% of startups fail, so it’s not very likely to make it right with the first attempt. Of course, there are different ways of failing: you can fail with style, heroically but also in a silly manner. In every case, the worst thing to do is not to reflect on your failure. Reflecting about your mistakes provides new knowledge to you and in this way your failure will eventually become a stepping stone for your future. So why should we talk about failure? Surely, there are cultural parameters that frame failure as a stain in someone’s life – as stigma. However, failure happens to everyone, especially in business. So, here is the number one reason for talking about failure: it happens – we don’t have to hide it under the carpet. Failures are simply part of the game in entrepreneurship, although it is hard to talk about it. We are not proud of our failures therefore talking openly about them is an act of bravery. Failing means moving, not sitting and doing nothing – and via “failing forward” you gain since you are closer to the right approach simply because one wrong path has been crossed out. The generalization of this stance creates a learning culture: people learn from their own but also from other’s mistakes. Failed attempts inform our future decisions. Real effects of failure (non-theoretical) Failure can really hurt. Out of its philosophical or epistemological assessment it can have some very practical implications. It’s quite possible that there will be serious turbulence on a personal level – dreams may be destroyed, professional/financial problems may arise, relations may be damaged, there may be even legal implications. In some cases, even friends and associates may get hurt by your own decisions. Is there life after failure? True, failure is a hateful thing. There are people who really suffered after failures. Part of our cultural system is the “blame game” – some of us point their fingers easily. In the corporate world the situation may be even tougher. On the other hand, people are also understanding and empathizing beings! While others judge, others give support! And don’t forget the public perception of comebacks! Think of Herman Maier in the Austrian context (Herminator)! Failures can become a starting point for admiration! In this direction, don’t take “public judgment” too seriously: think that some judge you for fights that they never gave themselves. Your present wisdom could be an asset concerning investors and a great comeback could even make headlines about you! Are there differences between America and Europe/Austria in the perception of failure? There is a controversy concerning the differences in the reception of entrepreneurial failure between the United States and Europe. One view supports that the American culture is much more open to failure and American entrepreneurs respectively keener in learning from their mistakes in order to make better decisions in the future. This implies that American investors are more enthusiastic in following people that are passionate while Europeans although, better in keeping the risk small, are much more conservative. Another view promotes the similarities in the mentality of the two cultures which include taking a step back, emotional recuperation and reflection before the next step. Entrepreneurial spirit is also present in Europe/Austria. Maybe it is still lacking in tech fields but after all entrepreneurship is not just about technology. What are the main reasons that businesses fail? Rule number one: failure is about us as entrepreneurs. Blaming the customers makes no sense – you will never learn anything out of it. The absence of a market is the primary reason for the failure of a product/business. Other good reasons may be cofounders who are not on the same page or investors who do not have enough trust in the project. The alpha and omega for success is always the team: a good team can make a mediocre idea work, while a bad team can destroy a brilliant idea. 90% of success is doing, not thinking and this is the reason that most startups end up with something different than the initial idea, a fact that demands flexibility. In a nutshell Failures are an amazing source to learn from! Yes, it hurts, yes it may suck at the beginning, but it is part of the learning process so you have to accept it. Draw a line when you have to and embrace your failure (don’t let denial turn you into to a “non-failed zombie”). Don’t try to solve problems that nobody cares for and always pursue your dream with a kick-ass team. If you fail, take the time to reflect on what went wrong and start over again. And most importantly: don’t let anybody stop you!","November 26th, 2019","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0108-300x200.jpg"

Depends on the technology and on the company’s goals If you want to keep your business logic within your company –> keep front-end development internally Outsourcing option mainly for back-end development Outsourcing can be a solution if: You know about the team of the company that provides the service You know what kind of developer you are looking for Outsourcing can be challenging: Language Culture Communication Quality You have to build knowledge before outsourcing!

"66","https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch55-number-age/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #55: Age is just a number","Young, hip, determined, full of new, cutting-edge ideas and hard-working. Are those the typical characteristics of an entrepreneur? Or is there more to the story? That’s what we were determined to find out at last month’s Stammtisch! Are age-diverse teams a thing? Let’s face it, our startup-bubble is filled with the young and hungry. When it comes to age – how diverse is our professional network, really? Then again, do we ever come in touch with people much older than ourselves? If you think about it, there aren’t a lot of chances to hang out with elderly people, other than your family members. So, it’s no surprise that age-diverse startups are rare –at least that’s what one might think. Typically young, typically old… We commonly attribute innovativeness, energy and curiosity, in short, entrepreneurial skills, to the young. Especially when it comes to startups, what do elderly really know? Entrepreneurs these days need to be tech-savvy, quick to adapt, and committed to their business 200% in order to potentially, maybe, eventually be successful. Who do you picture when hearing these keywords? Here’s the plot twist: a study conducted by Joshua Gans, a professor at the University of Toronto, shows that Silicon Valley founders who managed a successful exit are, on average, 47 years old. Imagine that! Valuing each other’s strength! Is it because older people have more experience, a better understanding of people, are more confident and better at sales? Whatever the reason, instead of thinking in stereotypes, it’s more than time to value each other for what we are good at, regardless of age – or anything else, for that matter. A number, the years we’ve lived, doesn’t define how and who we are. It’s all about the mindset. How many young people out there live a narrow-minded, mainstream life, while some older ones are longing to create something new, to make a difference? What would you do? “Would you found with a person significantly older than yourself?” I asked a friend today. “NO, definitely not!” Wow, I thought my friends were more open-minded than that. “I would start a company with somebody regardless of their age. What matters to me is the way they think. If they are up for new challenges, good at what they do and are an asset to the project, I would work with them. And you? What would you do? We are challenging you to go out and actively seek the company of people a good amount older than yourself. You might be surprised – and have stories to tell at our next Stammtisch! See you there!

"67","https://austrianstartups.com/startup-stammtisch-49-bro-culture-fake-till-make-ethics-startups/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #49: From bro culture to “Fake it ‘till you make it”","Have you ever found yourself in a strip club after a business meeting? This month’s Stammtisch focused on identifying and questioning outdated and often sexist business practices within startup and business culture in general. But first, let’s talk about the two important announcements of this Stammtisch. CEO and Editor in Chief of Metropole, Maggie Childs joined the board of AustrianStartups. Chances are you have already seen her at a Stammtisch before. On stage or in the crowd. We’re glad to have this experienced member of the startup community on board. Welcome Maggie! The second one is the newly released Austrian Startup Code of Conduct, which aims at providing a set of rules for a startup environment that has grown tremendously and is attracting a lot of new people. With this the Austrian startup community is taking a clear stand against unethical behavior. So check it out and give your pledge if you want to contribute to a professional and healthy startup environment in Austria. We want your support! That being said, here’s a quick rundown of this month’s Stammtisch topic and highlights. Bro! So why choose this topic and simultaneously release a code of conduct? Recent press coverage about issues at well-known international players of the startup ecosystem, such as Uber or 500 Startups has shown that there is still a lot of room for improvement in our society. Especially diversity and gender wise. And this month’s speakers definitely had their fair share of experiences that support that claim – inside and outside of the startup scene. “I know companies, typical old large-scale Austrian enterprises that have Christmas parties and afterwards everybody goes to the strip club. And it’s completely normal.”, Andreas Klinger from Product Hunt mentioned. “As a woman in a managing position you end up having to meet with people in those positions and they tend to be men. And then you get invited by one of them to a Stammtisch and then they tell you that you can’t come because you’re a girl. I’ve had this said to me three times and they were not even ashamed about it.”, Maggie Childs from Metropole added. And often these things tend to manifest beyond the settings of company-get-togethers. “I see a lot of old male founder teams and they go on to hire more white men and this doesn’t really stop. And when they’re already a team of 20 white men and they start talking about adding diversity to the team or they can’t find a man to fill the position, then they start thinking about hiring a woman. And when you join this team and it’s very alpha male-ish, with a foosball table in the office and “beer drinking Fridays” it’s not going to be a very welcoming environment.”, Floor Drees from sektor5/5starts explained. “I used to work for big corporations in Salzburg before I founded my own company. And we used to call it a Nudelsuppen or sausage fest because the majority of people working there were men.”, Johann Rath from TableConnect recalled. So how can we as a community move towards a diverse and fair working environment? We need to outline the benefits of diversity and speak up about sexism and harassment. When Maggie asked the crowd if they had witnessed sexism at their workplace several hands were raised. But the following question about who spoke up about it was met with a considerably smaller amount of hands. “And that’s what we can do. Talk about it. I think that’s a big step in the right direction. All of you would have made a difference by speaking up.” “Language is also very important. The language you use in your marketing and your external communication in general. It’s a powerful thing and you need to think about what you’re putting out there. And you also need to know how to speak up if you’ve witnessed something. So a collective understanding of how to talk about these issues is also very important.”, Floor added. The right amount of “faking it” Every entrepreneur has probably tweaked the truth a bit to buy more time or gain a slight advantage at some point. But every one of us also probably knows a story about a startup that turned out to be much less than expected. So where’s the line when it comes to “fake it ‘till you make it”? The story of Johann Rath’s TableConnect is an exemplary tale of when “faking it” turns into an actual product. Originally planned as a funny video, Johann and his colleagues uploaded a video of an iPhone connected to a table and turning it into touch-surface. The video went viral, leading to global media coverage. There were plenty of interview and acquisition requests and after rejecting offers for two years for obvious reasons, they decided to actually make TableConnect. Nonetheless, a lot of stories remain where “faking it” a bit too much ended badly for investors and founders alike. So what is ok and what is not when it comes to one of startup cultures most famed platitudes? “There’s a huge difference between faking something and having a vision. If you’re fundraising, you’re raising for something you will build in the end. It might not be there yet but that’s ok. But there is a fine line for sure. Faking it by not doing a life demo but recording it is fine but having a bot vote for your startup at a competition is not.”, said Floor “I know so many landing pages that pretend to be an actual product and pretend to have customers. But as long as it’s not fraud the market will decide. But if you need a little bit of bullshit like smart wording, why not?”, Andreas noted. So what should you take away from this month’s Stammtisch? Obviously, that we’re living in the 21st century. Be mindful of how your work environment is developing, celebrate diversity and equality, openly communicate about these things and most importantly, speak up about harassment and toxic behavior in your workplace. Oh, and don’t overdo the whole “faking thing”. Nobody likes fraud. See you at the next Stammtisch!

Die Corona-Krise trifft O¨sterreichs Wirtschaft hart. Auch Startups spu¨ren die Auswirkungen der Krise bereits unmittelbar: Umsa¨tze brechen ein, Gescha¨ftsmodelle funktionieren nicht mehr, laufende Fixkosten ko¨nnen nicht getragen werden und geplante Finanzierungsrunden werden in den na¨chsten Monaten nur schwer realisierbar sein. Ohne entsprechende Maßnahmen zur Unterstu¨tzung des o¨sterreichischen Startup O¨kosystems, drohen sowohl Jobs als auch bereits investiertes o¨ffentliches und privates Kapital verloren zu gehen. Eine Entwicklung die dem Standort nachhaltig schaden würde, da Startups essentielle Treiber von Innovation und Digitalisierung sind und eine Vielzahl von Arbeitspla¨tzen schaffen. Die bereits initiierten Instrumente der Bundesregierung stellen fu¨r viele Unternehmen eine u¨berlebenswichtige Unterstu¨tzung dar. Wie unsere vor kurzem veröffentlichte Umfrage zeigt, helfen die bisher vorgestellten Maßnahmen im Fall von Startups allerdings nur sehr bedingt: Nur 35% der Startups planen Kurzarbeit in Anspruch zu nehmen, 30% eine Stundung von Steuern & Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen. Fast die Hälfte der Startups erachten Überbrückungsgarantien (46%) und den Härtefallfonds (47%) für sich als ungeeignet, da notwendige Voraussetzungen nicht erfüllt werden können.

Acht von zehn Startups leiden unter den Folgen der aktuellen Lage und nur 58% sind derzeit optimistisch, die Krise zu überleben. Größtes Problem sind Liquiditätsengpässe, die durch massive Umsatzeinbrüche und das schwierige Fundraising-Umfeld entstehen. Rund ein Drittel der Startups rechnet folglich damit, Stellen abbauen zu müssen oder hat dies bereits getan. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich auch die innovative Kraft der Startups – fast die Hälfte arbeitet derzeit proaktiv an der Entwicklung von Lösungen gegen die Coronakrise. Startups sind anders. Die Umfrage zeigt auch, dass die bisher umgesetzten Hilfsmaßnahmen der Bundesregierung den Startups nur bedingt helfen.

"71","https://austrianstartups.com/summary-visions-startups-austria/","AustrianStartups","A summary of “Visions for Startups in Austria”","With our paper “Visions for Startups in Austria”, we are suggesting five main key aspects we see as necessary to turn Austria into an innovation-driven economy of the 21st century by leveraging todays main catalyst of innovation and growth: startups. If we do not develop the right ecosystem in Austria to be a “magnet” for (very mobile) talents and startups, the consequence is that the existing ones leave to countries with better suited conditions or their ambitions. Thus we release the Executive Summary (PDF, 1 MB) and the Full Version (PDF, 2MB) in German. Following a summary in English There are 3 inevitable trends of the 21st century so far that are shaping the global economy with the potential to shake things up: A digitalization of the global economy, faster innovation cycles, and the global rise of young, ambitious talent. Startups are both a consequence and an accelerating catalyst of these trends. For Austria, it is therefore absolutely vital to have a flourishing startup ecosystem. The following 5 key facts need to be addressed to build a better foundation for that ecosystem: Future-oriented Education Education is the basis for a societal change in terms of knowledge-based evolution and development. We therefore think that making education future-ortiented is a vital factor for becoming a nation of entrepreneurs and knowledge-society. By modernizing our education system, we can support the most important factor of startups: talended, ambistious young people. We suggest introducing IT education starting from primary school; practical entrepreneurship education starting from secondary school; and introducing a founder initiative and “founders garages” at higher education instutions. Improvement of the overall Environment for Founders Various laws and institutional aspects in Austria are based on firms as they existed decades ago. Modern companies and startups have other requirements. Our aim is to make it simpler and easier for entrepreneurs to found, grow and move their startups in/to Austria. We suggest the introduction of a simple employee participation model for private limited companies; the adaptation of the new foundation promotion (Neugründungsförderung) and business start program (Unternehmensgründungsprogramm); extension of structural subsidies for startup ecosystem; modernization of the commercial code (Gewerbeordnung); support of flagship tech & entrepreneurship events; adaptation of the red-white-red card (immigration card for skilled employees) for startups. Mobilization of Capital from Private Investors Austria has an enormous demand (and unfortunately currently a big lack) when it comes to private venture and business angel capital. We missed the opportunity in the past few decades to encourage and properly incentivize private invstors to invest into local companies and startups. We therefore think that the following measures can effectively adress this problem: creation of tax incentives for Austrian private investors; creation of a fund-of-fund model with state Cornerstone Investment in privately managed funds; “unleashing” crowdfunding and cowdinvesting through suitable regulation; Creating incentives for (Austrian) institutional investors to invest in startups; provision of resources for networking and fundraising activities with international investors Future-oriented Public Grants We do have a wide-spread variety of public grants and government support schemes and various of these programmes were established within the past few years. Its good to have them and important for startups. Their current “modus operandi”, however, is not well suited for startups. Therefore we suggest: reallocation of funding to innovative start-ups and R & D; expansion of smaller, faster public grants that are easier to apply; gradual harmonization of the funding application structure; no longer prefering projects which have cooperations with scientific institutions; more tolerance for adapting the project focus during the project period; make the funding and financing chain more predictable Political Awareness for Entrepreneurship The topics of startups and hi-tech companies get much higher attention from politics in other countries. We need a stronger anchoring of the topics within the Austrian political system to improve changes in the ecosystem. Therefore we suggest: introducing a “Founder and Startup Commisioner” within the government; the topics Innovative young companies and startups should be high on the agenda of top politicians WE ALL ARE AUSTRIANSTARTUPS!","November 27th, 2013","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/austrianstartups_vision-300x169.jpg"

"73","https://austrianstartups.com/the-future-of-austrianstartups/","AustrianStartups","The Future of AustrianStartups","In May 2018, AustrianStartups will be celebrating its 5th birthday. It started as a small grassroots non-profit initiative to make startups more visible in Austria and to help build an ecosystem to help them thrive. Since then, it has been one hell of a ride. Today, more than 30,000 social media followers, roughly 1,000 members and more than 50 partners make up our underlying support network. We have reached up to 160,000 monthly unique viewers on our communication channels, organized events for more than 10,000 participants in total and had an impact on several new government initiatives for startups by voicing the needs of the community. Since 2013, the Austrian startup ecosystem has evolved significantly and AustrianStartups as a living organization has evolved as well, trying to fill holes and implement suggestions from the community. As a result, if you ask five people what AustrianStartups does, you’ll probably get five completely different answers. So, to set the record straight, here is what AustrianStartups is planning for the future. Our vision for the future In 2018 we aim to regain focus and bring AustrianStartups to the next level, ready to take on the challenges of the years to come. It all starts with a belief we all share and have experienced first hand: Entrepreneurial thinking and acting are key for positive change. No matter if its a young entrepreneur, who wants to revive local bookstores in Vienna, a group of people who organize a non-profit job fair for refugees in Austria, or a few Ph.D. students launching a university spinoff working on a cure for specific cancer types. The more people feel empowered to develop solutions to problems instead of complaining about them, the better off society will be. In EU rankings, Austria has yet to reach competitive levels when it comes to entrepreneurial education and conditions. Our goal is to change this dramatically. In fact, our grand vision for the future is that entrepreneurship will be as common as skiing in Austria. This starts with nationwide skiing courses in schools and leads to Marcel Hirscher & Anna Veith tearing up the slopes in the Olympics. The role of AustrianStartups Ambitious goals need a team of collaborative players to make significant, sustainable change in a culture. We know we’re not alone in our efforts, but we believe we can play an important role. As an independent non-profit platform, we focus on three realms of influence: Inspire. Connect. Change. Inspire First of all, we aim to motivate people to develop solutions for problems themselves and provide them with valuable information on how to get off the ground. We want to help people get a realistic understanding of what it means to start your own business or initiate an innovative project: hard work, high impact, and a steep learning curve, but also that it doesn’t mean making fast cash. Our goal is to expand beyond our current community and create content that inspires the broader public and speaks to all generations. Connect Secondly, we strive to connect founders, supporters, entrepreneurial minds and policy-makers and enable exchange between them. This includes our various existing event series (Stammtisch, Office Hours, Stakeholder Roundtables & Vertical Uncovered) and will be expanded in the upcoming months. Change Third, we aim to research and analyse how Austria’s environment can change to give founders & entrepreneurial minds a greater chance for success. As an independent think tank that studies entrepreneurship and builds expertise around it, we will provide policymakers with comprehensive insights that have the power to trigger change. *What AustrianStartups is NOT: A special interest group (“Interessenvertretung”) or lobby organization for startups. We believe there are already plenty of special interest groups in Austria. We see a broad horizon for improvement, reaching beyond the direct needs and viewpoints of startups themselves. An association of startups (“Startup-Verband”). We are an open platform and welcome everyone who shares our vision to join us as a member or to join the team as a volunteer. This includes many startup founders, but also various other innovative minds. A platform that is affiliated/associated with any political party or political movement. We have always been and will always be politically neutral. New Look Our future vision comes with a fresh brand – starting with our logo. We wanted to stay true to our roots, but also signal a new beginning. Without any further ado, meet the new look of AustrianStartups: What’s next The first big project to launch us into this new era is already underway. In order to analyze current problems and identify potential solutions, we need much better, more comprehensive data. This is why we joined forces with several major institutions to create the Austrian Startup Monitor. Check it out here and (if you are a startup founder/manager) help Austria serve you better by taking 20 minutes to complete the survey!","March 20th, 2018","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Team-300x200.jpeg"
"74","https://austrianstartups.com/vertical-uncovered-health-uncovered/","AustrianStartups","Introducing Vertical Uncovered","The health industry is constantly changing, growing and presents an exciting field for new ideas and solutions. So in September, five startups won the chance to present their business concepts in front of 50 business angels. Kokoro The bigger the employee base the more complicated internal processes become. Kokoro focuses on the human side of that equation by aiming to improve the quality of life of employees and reduce staff fluctuation. The app collects and measures emotional data and turns it into Key Emotional Indicators to support and improve internal decision making within companies. Medworker If you’re a doctor or at least know a doctor, chances are you’ve heard an excessive amount of complaints about paperwork and the slow speed of bureaucratic processes accompanying said paperwork. Gathering, exchanging and organizing data can be hard when stacks of paper start piling up, so Medworker developed an app to connect multiple medical teams and retailers of medical equipment and make tedious paper communication a thing of the past. Image Biopsy Lab Although most medical staff considers diagnosing radiographs to be a simple standard procedure, the possibility of human error will always remain. Image Biopsy Lab created an A.I to automated this process and reduce the chance of false diagnoses. Just plug in your laptop, upload your radiographic images, let the robot do the rest and save some time while you’re doing it. No physicians needed. SpinaCare Ever experienced back pain during work? SpinaCare wants to change that by introducing a massage board designed for the workplace to reduce potential back problems. Just lean into it during one of your breaks, relax a little and do something good for your back – which is probably not in the best shape anyway. Abios Abios is an algorithmic biodata system that aims to improve psycho-psychic diagnostics. In layman’s terms: Abios can track your physical activity and personal sleep behavior which makes it useful in all kinds of different areas. Be it diagnostics, professional sports or just getting healthy and in shape. So no matter if you’re a professional athlete, sports enthusiast, a coach or a personal trainer, you should check Abios out. So these are the five startups that got a chance to pitch their concepts to over 50 business angels. Our next topic will be “Fintech Uncovered”. If your startup fits the bill and you’re looking for an opportunity to pitch your very own idea to a room full of people, who could take your startup to the next level, you should not miss out on this one!","September 20th, 2017","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vertical_Uncovered_aaia-820x461-300x169.jpg"
"75","https://austrianstartups.com/visionen-fur-startups-osterreich/","AustrianStartups","Our ambitions with “Visionen für Startups in Österreich”","As you may have noticed, we have been working on a document called “Visionen für Startups in Österreich” lately (which translates as Visions for Startups in Austria). Our ambition with this project is first to let politicians know what startups need. Second to raise awareness for startups in this country, in order to highlight the importance and emphasize on what lasting impact startups could have in Austria, provided with the best conditions needed for a vibrant ecosystem (venture capital, taxes, subsidies, social insurance, regulations, etc). As by now, we handed over the paper to every political party in the Austrian parliament in the past few weeks and had good talks about their ambition to help us working on a more startup-friendly ecosystem in Austria. The joint handover to Minister Bures and Christoph Matznetter from SPÖ (Credit: Lucia Vilsecker) Harald Mahrer from Julius Raab Stiftung, an ÖVP thinkthank, accepted the paper Werner Kogler from the Green party at the paper handover (Credit: Lucia Vilsecker) Matthias Strolz and Niko Alm from the NEOS party accepted the paper Kathrin Nachbaur from Team Stronach accepted the paper Mr. Schellenbacher from the FPÖ at the Parliament’s Säulenhalle The idea of providing politicians with insights what startups really need was brought to our attention in May by several stakeholders and startups. AustrianStartups decided to gather the relevant data in cooperation with Pioneers and SpeedInvest and we started a joint Austrian-wide startup survey (from which SpeedInvest created the Austrian Startup Report 2013, an overview of the status quo in the startup ecosystem). Based on the results of this survey, the input of many stakeholders and productive meetings with all political parties we produced a paper to improve the startup scene in Austria. In July, August and September we gathered the startup scene in Vienna at our “Stammtisch” events to talk directly to politicians from various about their specific needs. Couple of weeks later, we had the first draft, which summed up the details for the final paper. Today (26th Nov 2013), this final paper was presented at a press conference together with the Austrian Startup Report 2013. The paper does not represent “demands” and can rather be seen as working paper to be used as broad yet detailed input for the most important areas that concern startups in Austria. It will be publicly available to everyone (startups, stakeholders, media and public), in order to spread the word and involve the whole community in making Austria a better place for startups! Our ambition with the release of this document is to help all Austrian startups to work in a more startup-friendly environment – now and in the future, because we believe Austria has to make the transition to a highly innovation-driven economy in the digitalized world of the 21st century. And startups are an important catalyst of this transistion. WE ALL ARE AUSTRIANSTARTUPS!

"76","https://austrianstartups.com/welcome-adrian-michael-farewell-can-daniel/","AustrianStartups","Welcome Adrian & Michael / Farewell Can & Daniel","Meet the New Board Members Adrian Zettl-Singh AustrianStartups & me I feel right at home at AustrianStartups. In fact, I’ve been a part of the AustrianStartups family since 2014, when I joined as part of the first official volunteer intake to manage and grow the social media presence. These past years have been a crazy, wonderful ride for me (personally and professionally), for AustrianStartups, and for the whole Austrian startup ecosystem. When I started out in the field, there were about 50 people in Austria who could be considered startup folk, so newcomers got to know the veterans rather quickly. In this small but growing ecosystem, the untamable spirit and support of this community helped my partners and me start and grow our company, TheVentury, to support innovators with key services in innovation management, data and software engineering, as well as growth marketing. We created the accelerator program ELEVATE for machine learning and AI startups from around the world, which enabled us to start building a portfolio of startup investments. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with and learn from some of the most ambitious and successful entrepreneurs and innovators in Austria and beyond. Today the situation in the startup scene has evolved, with all sorts of motivated players and innovators contributing to a thriving ecosystem. I like to think that I’ve grown as an entrepreneur and as a human, alongside this amazing community. And AustrianStartups was a key factor in my journey. Since AustrianStartups has provided me with endless insights and access, I’m honored to be able to contribute as a member of the board and hopefully give back of, to both the community and AustrianStartups as an organization. Big shoes & big plans When Can asked me to take over for him on the board I was hesitant. Firstly, because the shoes of this veteran startupper seemed too big to fill, but then the excitement kicked in. The challenge was just too intriguing to say no to. Thank you Can for all the inspirational talks and the trust you’ve placed in me! I can’t wait to tackle the big plans and challenges ahead! Execution is everything & education is the key I believe that execution is everything in innovation, and in order to execute well on your ideas, you need to develop the right skills and know-how. Ever since I began my startup journey, I’ve been able to spread the knowledge I gained by teaching entrepreneurship, digital business, growth hacking and digital marketing at various universities and programs. Playing a small part in enabling budding entrepreneurs to achieve their goals faster and more sustainably has been one of the most satisfying experiences of my career to date. I look forward to discovering what we as AustrianStartups can do to get skills and know-how out there, so that as many people as possible can feel equipped to at least consider the possibility of founding a company and following through with their ideas. Entrepreneurship the Austrian & European way I believe “entrepreneurship done right” is one of the most efficient ways to make a positive impact on society, and the Austrian and European perspective has a lot to offer when it comes to “doing it right.” Entrepreneurial innovation is particularly essential in times of climate crisis and accelerated socio-economic changes around the world. For years, we’ve been looking to Silicon Valley for innovation and the methods of bringing it about. We’ve learned a lot, but it’s time to confidently combine these learnings with our own DNA in a European context. I believe this combination will result in an efficient, sustainable and responsible approach to entrepreneurship, technology and innovation, leading to our own unique success factors. I’m particularly interested in how to best apply hypothesis-driven innovation methods (you know, all that lean startup and growth hacking stuff) to any situation and at any scale – individual, community, startup, corporate, government, anywhere really – with the goal of sustainable and responsible innovation and development.I’m excited to explore all this, and more, with AustrianStartups, and other stakeholders. Essentially whoever wants to talk about it <U+0001F642> Find me here. Michael Ionita History My affiliation to AustrianStartups began when startups were still to be a rare beast in Austria. Back in 2011, there were only a few individuals around with the courage to step forth into the startup jungle. For most other people in business, we startup folk, were regarded as business punks. Within the sphere of the Austrian mentality, this meant that our chances of success were deemed small to non-existent. To them, it almost seemed that we were attempting to take a shortcut to success. Nothing, however, could have been further from the truth. My RealLifeConnect Co-founder Jürgen Höbarth lay the groundwork for AustrianStartups, by building a Facebook fan page and growing it’s Likes to an impressive and respectable size. Back then, there were many and varied funky ways to doing so quickly. Jürgen however, moved to Hong Kong to expand the RealLifeConnect business overseas but didn’t want to leave the AustrianStartups community unattended so he decided to invite Vlad Gozman to be page admin and the rest is history as told in a previous blogpost. Thus, it began, and the association AustrianStartups was born. Now, nine years later, I was asked to join the board. Naturally, I said “yes!” <U+0001F642> Tick tock Here’s what makes me tick: I believe that we are living in the best ever time to pursue our (business) dreams. I believe that delivering value to people is the only way to create a sustainable business and I believe that things that are worth something don’t come easy! “Solving problems” is the essence of why we are here. I know that some of us crave to solve problems on a larger scale, at which point we need help, a team, a company or a community. AustrianStartups sets the stage on so many levels. It provides a stage on which we can express what we believe in, and build something to prove it. Most of all, AustrianStartups shapes the political landscape in startups’ favor, a priceless contribution. I look forward to using my role at AustrianStartups as an opportunity to give something back. What do you believe in? Come to the next AustrianStartups “Stammtisch” and share your thoughts and passion with us. My current focus At the moment, my main topic is “building successful tech & product teams”. I’m helping companies to build teams from the ground up, or re-build them after a tough period. This involves having a creative atmosphere, workflows, common beliefs and a vision to work towards. At AustrianStartups, I stand for technological progress and a numbers-driven approach, in order to innovate for you and measure our success. My background is technical, I started out earning a living by developing websites and apps back in 2004. Soon I discovered the Startup world with my Startup called RealLifeConnect – it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. After that I built a tech team practically from scratch for Mobfox, a $40M revenue company in the advertising industry. Now I’m helping Walls.io in building a tech team and growing the product. What I’m Passionate About? I’m passionate about all things tech and finding solutions that solve people’s problems at scale. I also have a thing for numbers – not in the traditional sense, which would require you to be a math genius to even grasp it – but in the sense that numbers are at the core of everything I do. Numbers guide my decision making, so I can rely on them more than on my gut feelings. I’m an avid golfer. I only started about eighteen months ago and am still far from awesome at it but I can hold my own in a round of business golf when needed. <U+0001F609> I have also been a Cuban Salsa dancer for 16 years, and you can find me at various Latino venues in the evenings. My most recent passion is helping AustrianStartups reach a position of sustainable growth, so that we can serve you even better. I aim to succeed with my fellow board members and our passionate team of volunteers, without whom we couldn’t function. Thanks for the trust you’ve placed in me. Let’s rock this ???????? Farewell Words Can Ertugrul A day in September… It was September 2013, a few weeks before the federal elections, and looking back, we had no clue what we were doing. That’s abundantly clear from a picture we took that day at our workspace on Spengergasse: Christoph Jeschke and I are both wearing blazers, not hoodies. We wanted to look serious. AustrianStartups was an unknown, newly-born initiative, and there we were sitting alongside Oliver Holle in front of a bunch of journalists. As a veteran, Oliver kept his cool. It was Christoph and my first-ever press conference. The stakes were high and I still remember how nervous we both were, amplified by the lack of sleep due to finishing and printing our “VisionsPapier” just in time. I don’t know what the bigger relief was back then, the press conference finally coming to an end or, over the next few days seeing that it did, in fact, lead to a big spark of public attention. That spark was crucial and the timing was just right. We did it! But who were we? I attended a wedding a few months ago, where the father of the bride said in his eloquent speech “Behind every person, there is another person.” So true. As Christoph and I sat at that table, there were many other people “sitting behind us”. Among them, and as part of the first board, were Adiam Emnay, Daniel Cronin, Vlad Gozman, and Patrick Manhardt. Behind the initial six of us, there were countless supporters and friends who helped us get started. The backbone of the initiative was made up of a community of hundreds who participated in our first survey, which was the foundation of the vision paper and press conference. Without the community’s involvement there would be no survey, no paper, no press conference, no initial spark, no AustrianStartups as we know it. The same can be said for every single thing that AustrianStartups has achieved as an organization: We’ve always been by the community, for the community. “We all are AustrianStartups” was our first slogan but it was so much more. Without the incredible, sometimes invisible work and dedication of the team, local representatives, supporters, partners, advisors, entrepreneurs and stakeholders, AustrianStartups could not have become what it is today. A heartfelt thank you to every one of you. You know who you are. Impact and growth, both mean change Looking at all the team members past and present, their shared values of curiosity and open-mindedness, their unshakable spirit, and their support for each other, makes me feel truly proud. Proud that I have been part of an organization that attracted so many bright and purpose-driven individuals who co-created a collaborative, engaging, and inclusive organizational culture. An organization set out to positively impact the ecosystem it is a part of, and at the same time one that, at its core, promotes professional and personal growth in everyone who is part of it. Impact and growth both mean change. And to be part of a change, we ourselves must change. I believe that is just as true for individuals as it is for organizations… and consequently also for their board members. It is from that perspective that I personally could not be happier that Adrian, who was among the first volunteers at AS, said yes to take my place on the board. For many years he has been the backbone of the AustrianStartups social media team, which he built from scratch. If getting to that first press conference was a sprint to create the needed spark in traditional media, Adrian and his team’s efforts were a marathon to build the organization’s content engine on digital media. That became part of the foundation of what AustrianStartups is today. With his upbeat personality alongside his exemplary and supportive leadership style, Adrian has become a valued colleague in the AustrianStartups team. In addition, with his long-lasting dedication for the startup community, as well as his valuable experience as an entrepreneur, he is the best successor I could have wished for. Thank you Adrian for years of great work and your contribution so far! I am equally excited about Michael joining the board and I want to express my gratitude to both of you for taking on this responsibility for years to come. I wish you two and the whole team an exciting continuation of the journey… You all are AustrianStartups. Daniel Horak Start with “why”?! As some of you might know, I started my first company, Spoken Language System (we developed virtual assistants, aka chatbots) almost 13 years ago. Back then, I was 20 years old and had no clue about startups or starting a company. In 2007, there was nothing even resembling a startup scene in Vienna, so connecting with other founders, sharing knowledge, getting feedback (much less funding) was a real challenge. We tried to grow for several years and got a small amount of public funding, but in the end, we failed and my cofounder and I decided to go our separate ways. After a few years in the corporate and consulting world, I made my way back into the startup world in 2012, starting Crowdinvesting platform CONDA with my co-founder Paul Pöltner Our aim was to change the way startups get funding in Austria. My past startup (failure) experience was a strong driver for launching CONDA, so when Daniel Cronin approached me in 2014 – we met a few years before at the second batch of the hackathon-style startup competition StartupLive and the first season of “2 minutes 2 million” on PULS 4 – and asked if I wanted to join the board of Austrian Startups, I immediately said “yes.” For me, this signified another missing puzzle piece in the burgeoning startup scene in Austria, and I was eager to be of help and foster positive change. The startup rollercoaster Running and growing my own startup and being part of AustrianStartups wasn’t always easy because both meant a lot to me and both “babies” brought with them countless ups and downs. Nevertheless, looking back on the past few years being part of AustrianStartups, working with so many great and smart people from different countries, achieving so many great things together – I couldn’t be prouder and more thankful. Six years ago I couldn’t have imagined how many great experiences I would make and what role AustrianStartups would play in the Austrian economy. Still, it’s just a beginning. As long as starting a company is a foreign concept for most of the population and children don’t learn about entrepreneurship in school there is still a lot to do. Let’s make change before we get changed Running CONDA now for over seven years has taught me a very important lesson: During the lifecycle of a startup, the founder(s) need to adapt to various roles – the company and its structure changes so the founders have to do so too. Another thing I’ve learned is that you should always be one step ahead and proactive, not passive – you need to embrace change. For me, AustrianStartups is also continuously changing because the ecosystem, the people and the technology changes. It was always important to me to try to go where we see a gap – to go where nobody else was going. We aimed to create new things, connect the dots and not by simply doing more of the same. That’s the reason why, some time ago, we started a process of change within the board and I am proud that we were able to convince Maggie Childs and (later) Katharina Unger as well to join us. And now it is time for the next step, which means that I will trustfully handover my board duties to Michael Ionita-Ganea. I am excited about the fresh ideas and perspectives that Michael is going to bring to AustrianStartups. AustrianStartups 4ever So it is time for me to say goodbye and a big thank you to each and everyone who was part of and supported AustrianStartups over the last six years. I loved the work we managed to get done and I can’t wait to see what the next years will bring. I won’t be totally gone, as I’ll be joining the advisory board and will always stay deeply connected to AustrianStartups. I wish all of you the best for the future and rock it!

"77","https://austrianstartups.com/what-can-startups-learn-from-darwin/","AustrianStartups","What can startups learn from Darwin?"," Entrepreneurship and science are often considered to be very distant relatives. While scientists discover the secrets of nature, entrepreneurs work on uncovering new opportunities to improve our daily lives. Still there are some common approaches that both entrepreneurs and scientists take to create innovations, such as experimentation. Whether you are studying the effect of chemical compounds on a virus or choosing the best advertising platform for your product – only experiments will give you a definite answer. A marketing team analysing the results from A/B tests to select the best background colour for their e-commerce platform uses quite similar statistical approaches as scientists. If we further compare scientific and entrepreneurial approaches to tackle a problem, we will find even more similarities. To make things spicier, let’s move away from the flickering monitors of the twenty-first century and explore what we can learn from the renowned scientist of the 19th century, the father of evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin. 1. Perfectionism is your enemy Competition is the best medicine against perfectionism. Charles Darwin was prompted to publish his groundbreaking book On the Origin of Species because of the threat of being scooped by another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace. Although Darwin was not satisfied with the quality of the early draft of On the Origin of Species, his minimal viable product, or MVP, this manuscript has become one of the most influential scientific books in the history of humankind. The early release of MVP is emphasized in the iconic book The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, who defines it as “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”1. The earlier you get feedback on your product, the more resources and time you have to improve it. 2. Ideas come first, details – last The theory of evolution developed by Charles Darwin has become an Ariadne’s thread for all branches of biology. It has created a general structure of the tree of life explaining how different species originated and evolved. Today it doesn’t matter if you are studying tiny molecules or giant elephants – evolution is the main guiding principle behind any biological discipline. Startups also use a general framework regardless of the industries they are operating in. Entrepreneurs start with ideation and creating prototypes. A process of trial and errors help startups to learn about customer needs and adapt to new challenges. Experimentation is a key to this growth process2. 3. Collect data before you jump to conclusions Charles Darwin spent almost five years as a naturalist on the ship “Beagle” travelling around the world. He collected evidence of different geological periods that our planet lived through in the past, dug up fossils of giant ground sloth in South America and documented data on the diversity and evolution of finches at Galapagos Islands. Darwin brought home fifteen notebooks from his journey filled with pictures and observations that played a crucial role in shaping his view of evolution. It took him almost two decades to explore these data systematically and turn the collection of facts into the fully formed theory3. In the modern world in which we are saturated with information the ability to extract and organise essential facts is a valuable skill. Since data is a fuel for growth hacking, companies that routinely analyse customer’s behaviour and use this information to adjust their products or services demonstrate sustainable growth in sales and attract new customers 4,5. 4. Your failures might be the seeds of your success Charles Darwin was definitely not the best student. In fact, he even dropped out of medical school at Edinburgh University. His father, a renown medical doctor, once told Charles: ”You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.” Well, Darwin turned his early passion for “rat-cathing” into his profession and became one of the most prominent scientists in the history of humankind. A great example of turning failure into commercial success which can be found in the world of product design is the humble Post-it. The small sticky paper that can be easily glued to your notes and torn off multiple times is wildly popular around the world. Post-it notes are produced and sold in colossal quantities – over 50 billion units per year. This product was originally developed based on a weak glue invented in 1968 by Dr Spencer Silver, a scientist from American company 3M. Actually, Dr Silver was aiming to develop a super-strong glue. Despite his best efforts, Silver’s glue was very weak. On the bright side – this weak glue was pressure-sensitive and reusable. Most people were unconvinced by a glue that did not stick properly, but Art Fry, a colleague of Dr Silver, came up with the bright idea of using it for reusable sticking paper. And so the Post-it was born, a product which is now sold in over 100 countries worldwide7,8. 5. Think big! Not only did Darwin found the new science – evolutionary biology – but he has also transformed our outlook on the world. The theory of evolution had a lasting impact on various components of our civilization including art, philosophy and politics. Radical innovations have profound effects on our lives. The most successful entrepreneurs are not the ones who sell the most, but the ones who transform industries. Big-picture thinking helps to achieve intermediate goals and communicate key messages to the general public. Would you be more interested to read an article about a company which develops novel rockets or about a company with ambitions to colonize Mars? Ask Elon Musk about it. Scientists and entrepreneurs know that there is no easy path to innovations. They have learned the hard way that experimenting, analysing data, fighting perfectionism, failing and starting over is the only viable approach to succeed in expanding our knowledge about the world and advancing our society. Probably the goals and approaches of science and entrepreneurship are not that different, after all? References: 1. Eric Ries, Minimum Viable Product: a guide.

It is an open place for all startups, stakeholders, and interested people, who are all encouraged to launch joint initiatives with us. The importance of visibility Some might argue that the startup scene in Austria isn’t that big. We are convinced, however, that it is rapidly growing and has a lot of great people who are pursuing great projects and initiatives for the community, as well as great startups in the community. This “community”, however, is difficult to grasp at times, for insiders and outsiders alike. The local Viennese startup scene does not really know what is happening in Tyrol, the different players in Styria might learn something from the experiences of the community in Upper Austria, and so on. Besides that, new entrepreneurs sometimes don’t know where investors or incubators are, investors sometimes don’t know about exiting startups and entrepreneurs sometimes don’t know about people who could act as a mentor to them. AustrianStartups wants to provide exactly this kind of visibility. Bringing everyone on one table There are shared interests but yet little coordination within “the community”… a shared initiative seems to be missing, that could leverage synergies. AustrianStartups is trying to fill this gap and connect the dots… not as a substitute to existing initiatives, projects, events, and organizations but as a shared layer for all of them. A neutral initiative and brand that brings the different stakeholders together and also aims to leverage and support existing initiatives that want to foster the startup ecosystem in Austria. A little bit of organization neededWe are so good together The neutral platform AustrianStartups acts as an aggregator and multiplicator for information, activities, and initiatives that are relevant to the startup community. Naturally, a form of organization is needed to funnel operations and ensure a structure that is bringing things forward. To ensure the most important part of it, the neutrality, we decided to create a non-profit organization (“Verein”), where any interested person can become a member. National Community, Aggregated Ressources & Common Voice To summarize, AustrianStartups intends to establish 3 pillars on which we hope the Austrian startup community can even grow bigger and get better connected: First, creating a more connected national community for startups in Austria, and bringing all entrepreneurs together through initiatives like local meetups, an online forum, aggregated content on our Facebook page, and regional representatives. Second, offering an in-depth and growing overview of the ecosystem itself, essential entrepreneurial tools, information, and events. Third, by bringing relevant stakeholders together with startups, we want to formulate up-to-date needs and demands, and face them together with the community… a common voice to the public, so to speak.

We see ourselves as community initiative that wants to create significant impact, not more, not less. We are also not a substitute to official and/or public institutions such as the chamber of commerce, public incubators, public support and/or grant institutions. We are an additional layer to them, trying to cater to the specific needs of startups, which are a bit different than those of small and medium enterprises. Aren’t startups just small & medium enterprises anyway? We believe that there is a difference between all entrepreneurs and specifically startups. All startups are entrepreneurs, but not all entrepreneurs (who we believe are all together the backbone of the economy!) are necessarily startups. If you see and define yourself as a startup, chances are high that you actually are one. If you are not sure, then the closest definition we could find would be along the thoughts of Steve Bank (best-selling author and one of the fathers of the Lean startup movement) and Paul Graham (Founder of Y-combinator): “A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.” – Steve Blank “A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.” – Paul Graham In other words: startups can come in all forms, but are united in their association with (potentially) fast/strong growth as well as their search for a scalable business model. They are mostly, but not exclusively, technology-oriented companies*, many of which seek to disrupt an existing market or to create a new market. * whereas technology includes, but is not solely limited to: Hardware, Software, Internet & Mobile Technologies, Communication, Bio-Tech, Medical, Robotics, Electronics, Mechatronics, Energy, Transportation, Environmental,… What YOU can do Sign-up for FREE and become a member to benefit from increasing specials such as newsletter, invitation to meetings (Stammtisch), be visible with your startup on the StartupMap, bring in your own project ideas for the startup ecosystem (and launch them with us), and have a vote in how and where AustrianStartups should be active… more goodies to follow. Companies, organizations and legal entities, which want to support AustrianStartups, can do so as supporting members. Currently we are talking with stakeholders, foundations, and individuals who want to contribute to AustrianStartups. We are open for talks with everyone, but want and have to ensure the neutrality of AustrianStartups at any time. Therefore, if needed, we would also decline a partnership with potentially interested supporting members. Beside the already announced supporting members, we are glad to present our main sponsors: the Internet Foundation Austria (IPA) known for its internet grant scheme netidee, which provides us with crucial support in the initial phase.
