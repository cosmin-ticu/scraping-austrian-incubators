Should I pursue my own startup idea, or should I accept a job offer to become CXO at AustrianStartups’? I was torn. With AustrianStartups I could improve the Austrian ecosystem by helping others to fulfill their entrepreneurial ambitions. However, I was also very passionate about my sustainable venture rePhil, a new system for reusable takeaway packaging. I questioned whether I could inspire others to pursue their innovative ideas if I don’t lead by example and start my own business. After a month of weighing the options, I decided to pursue both. I joined AustrianStartups as CXO on a part-time basis while simultaneously working on launching rePhil. We were concerned that neither of these roles could be handled with only a part time commitment and that the decision might send mixed signals. But I saw synergies in the combination. I was fortunate that Markus and the board of AustrianStartups gave me the flexibility to join as part-time CXO and that my team at rePhil supported my decision. Ultimately, the setup seemed perfect – I felt I was fulfilling in my role at AustrianStartups by applying my learnings from rePhil to improve the startup ecosystem in Austria. I could also use the knowledge and network I gained with AustrianStartups to grow rePhil. Though I worked long hours, the combination worked out well for the first six months. RePhil was making fast progress: We gained a new team member Alex, launched with our pilot customer the cafeteria at A1 telecom, and joined multiple acceleration programs. At AustrianStartups we set a new focus on sustainability by launching circle17, got 19 of the AS Agenda points into the turquoise-green government program and created a strategy for a new project: the Entrepreneurial Leadership Program, fostering the most promising future entrepreneurial leaders in Austria. Then, the global pandemic took us by surprise. At first, the lockdown seemed to improve our work. At rePhil, we were faster than expected with developing the app, and we climbed an extremely steep learning curve. We dove deep into user journeys, UI and UX design and what it needs to develop an app. At AustrianStartups we mobilized the community by launching Hack the Crisis, set up a survey to track the immediate effect of the pandemic on startups in Austria, and virtualized all events and programs, including our newly-launched Entrepreneurial Leadership Program. However, the crisis also showed the weak points in my two-folded strategy. It was a tough journey. Some days I got up and felt like there was a huge weight on top of me and every time I got one burden off my shoulders two new ones appeared. Nevertheless, I learned to understand how to use my strengths, weaknesses, and passions. Here are my key insights from this intense period in the hope you can benefit from my experience. #1 Founding a startup is not a part-time job Being in home office made it increasingly difficult to separate my professions. This made apparent how hard it is to build a startup while acting with full passion and energy in a leadership role in another organization. I gave 120% in both roles and still never had the feeling of doing enough. As my two co-founders worked full-time on rePhil, I was often unaware of certain progress, obstacles or steps we had taken. I wasn’t part of all meetings and to move fast, some decisions had to be made without my vote. This created inevitable friction with my co-founders. After half a year of very little sleep, exuberant highs and devastating lows, we realized, after some long conversations that if we want to get the startup off the ground, all founders would need to commit to the project full-time. This realization didn’t feel right. The canteen market was struggling, and our planed pilot got postponed for an undetermined amount of time. We were very consumed with figuring out our team situation which made our motivation hit rock bottom. On the other side, my work with AustrianStartups energized and inspired me through interesting discussions with our ELP fellows and new projects that were constantly evolving. Almost a year later, I faced the same decision – rePhil or AustrianStartups? #2 You don’t have to be a founder to be an entrepreneur This was the most challenging decision of my life. In order to decide, I reflected on my professional journey. I realized my true passion is to inspire, connect and empower others. What gave me the most energy were the sustainable solutions that developed out of circle17, the inspiring fellows that started to implement their own ideas while participating at the ELP and the energized pupils that came up with inspiring ideas during our entrepreneurship week. Nevertheless, there remained this voice in my head, telling me that I was a phony in my role at AustrianStartups if I hadn’t founded a startup myself. It wasn’t until I realized something profound: You do not have to be a founder to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship means to be open to new ideas, to take risks in order to implement innovative and impactful ideas. This insight gave me the final nudge to focus on my entrepreneurial role within AustrianStartups. #3 Focus sets you free The decision to downgrade my involvement with rePhil, as hard as it was, opened the possibility to focus my energy on AustrianStartups. It allowed me to reflect and take the concept of our programs much further. Even though others felt that I was doing a great job before, I finally felt that I could truly own the leadership position that I signed on for a year ago. Just at that time, AustrianStartups got the chance to launch the dream that was three years in the making: to bring entrepreneurship into grade schools. My commitment to AustrianStartups freed Markus to take a step back from the operational management and focus on working on a more strategic level, putting our NPO more a financially sustainable foundation. We can bring AustrianStartups much further by truly co-leading the organization, which is why, from now on, AustrianStartups has two managing directors: Markus Raunig and myself, Hannah Wundsam. I am excited for this next chapter at AustrianStartups and am confident that together with our amazing team, we can inspire students to make their ideas reality by bringing the inventor spirit into schools, making the entrepreneurship ecosystem more inclusive throughout Austria and helping the government understand which barriers they need to do away with to create an environment in which founders can flourish. Even though, combining my work with rePhil and AustrianStartups was demanding, I don’t regret the experience. I went through the struggles and thrills of an early stage founder and now feel 100% confident that with my full-time commitment to AustrianStartups I can use these learnings to shape the Austrian entrepreneurship ecosystem for the better. Are you with me on that journey? Then let’s do this!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-300x300.jpg","November 8th, 2020","en",0.987860500812531,0.0134020426194184,0.59617155790329,0.0459856274537742,0.344440802931786
"https://austrianstartups.com/a-message-from-our-new-cxo/","AustrianStartups","A message from our new CXO","I never thought I would ever start my own company. Actually, until 4 years ago, I thought that entrepreneurship is something for guys who want to make lots of money quickly, talking in their own language about topics like pitching, pivoting and bootstrapping. Then I met an entrepreneur who completely changed my mind. She founded a social business and when she explained to me the concept of social entrepreneurship I felt that this was the perfect way to connect my business studies to my philanthropical ambitions. So I googled social entrepreneurship Vienna and found the Impact Hub. I joined the hub as a host, and it was only then that I learned to understand, what entrepreneurship really means. It means having a vision and implementing it in order to tackle real needs and have an impact on your customers’ lives. It means recognizing problems and finding creative ways of how to solve them. It means working together in a team of people who share your vision and who take into account long working hours and no salary in order to build something they believe in. And it means a roller-coaster of many emotional highs and lows, often happening on the very same day. Inspired by the social entrepreneurship community I really took a deep dive into the Austrian entrepreneurship ecosystem by joining [sic!]– the students’ innovation centre, working at the start-up Playroom and organising the Entrepreneurship Avenue. After being active on the ecosystem itself, I started to explore my own start-up idea, RePhil, fighting to-go-packaging waste with a circular system for reusable takeaway packaging. Now I had the chance to experience the ecosystem from the founder’s point of view, with all of its perks and challenges. I feel very privileged to have been able to make all of these experiences, which started by a first introduction to the concept of entrepreneurship at Impact Hub. Now, that the ecosystem has shaped me I am proudly joining AustrianStartups to take on the position of a shaper myself. Austria has amazing preconditions for founders. An educated customer base, affordable living situations, a fitting size to test a product or service and great talent. As CXO of AustrianStartups I want to support founders who have a vision and want to have a positive impact on our society. In order to have a viable business it is crucial to be conscious of the social and ecological impact that a venture has. Therefore I am excited to lead together with my colleague Stefan and the team of RespACT the Circle17 project, where we enable cooperation between start-ups and corporates to develop joint projects that tackle the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For my first 6 months as CXO of AustrianStartups I set myself three main goals which shall help to achieve our vision to make entrepreneurship as common as skiing in Austria. To burst our bubble Entrepreneurship in Austria has not yet reached the broad population. With our next projects and events we want to target new groups who are outside of our current bubble. To foster the skills and diversity of our volunteer team Our team of more than 50 volunteers all over Austria are the heart of this organization. I see it as my responsibility to motivate and engage them so they can reach their full potential. Together as a team we can bring AustrianStartups to the next level. To grow AustrianStartups outside of Vienna We have amazing local representatives in every Austrian province. I want to tighten our relation and collaboration within the provinces so we can support entrepreneurship holistically all over Austria. I am looking forward to work together with the team of AustrianStartups to empower entrepreneurs with impactful visions and to truly make entrepreneurship as common as skiing in Austria.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20191022_113532-e1572002634324-300x170.jpg","October 25th, 2019","en",0.997388422489166,0.00691698025912046,0.461445033550262,0.00935612991452217,0.52228194475174

They are essential players to make the European Green Deal and the European Digital Strategy a reality. They are key in creating new jobs and sustainable European prosperity. Currently, EU27 boasts more than 80.000 startups of which 51 are unicorns. The investments raised by European startups were 41 billion US dollars in 2020, up from 36,6 billion US dollars in 2019. During Q1 2021 27 innovative companies got a valuation of more than 1 billion US dollar in Europe. At first glance, this is very positive news. However, only 13 of these companies were located in EU27 before the funding round, and only 7 of them will stay in EU27 after the funding round, which paints a much bleaker picture. In the same period, the US produced 67 new unicorns. Estonia, meanwhile, has given birth to more unicorns per capita than any other country in the world. With 7 such companies for a 1,3 million population, this represents 1 case per 185.000 inhabitants. To put this in perspective: to achieve a similar feat, Germany would have to produce more than 400 innovative companies valued at 1 billion US dollars and France more than 300. We believe that Europe should considerably step up its ambitions. A desirable “moonshot” project would be to create an environment that produces 10x more unicorns in 10 years time! To achieve these ambitious goals, we recommend a series of concrete actions, grouped in 4 main themes: Definitions & Data Talent Ecosystems Policy Advising to Member States You can access the action plan with the complete list of recommendations here.

Over the years many stood out in shaping the ecosystem in a special way and helped in creating the startup community as we would call it today. As ambassadors of the community, representatives of a certain group in the community, enablers and networkers 9 outstanding individuals have joined AustrianStartups in our advisory board. Each and everyone stands for a certain group in our ecosystem and has a specific task to support the community. Besides that they help us in realizing our mission, provide us with strategic advice and assist us with their network. Finally, they define the strategy of AustriaStartups together with the management (‘Vereinsvorstand’) to answer the most important needs of the community at the right time. “Stop talking, show us the advisory board” Right, here we go… Andreas Tschas: Startup Hub Austria Andi is the Co-Founder of Pioneers. He focuses on connecting the Austrian with international ecosystems. Birgit Hofreiter: Entrepreneurship at Universities As head of Informatics Innovation Center (i2c) at TU Vienna, Birgit has an eye on fostering entrepreneurship at Austrian universities. Florian Gschwandtner: Connection to Berlin The Runtastic CEO and Co-Founder aims to connect Austria to the vibrant startup hub in Berlin. Hansi Hansmann: Business Angels Connecting business angels and startups is the focus of one of Austria’s most distinguished business angels.

Networking Partners for Social Business and Universities Impact startups are an essential part of the Austrian ecosystem. The Impact Hub Vienna is the key player for social businesses from all kinds of industries. As AustrianStartups aims to be a brand for all startups in Austria, it is the logical conclusion to connect with the local hero to foster social entrepreneurship. Not sure what Impact Startups are? Well, they are entrepreneurial ventures whose primary objective is to maximise their social impact rather than the profit. They are addressing and solving societal challenges with innovative new products and services. More than 2/3 of Austria’s entrepreneurs have studied at a university. Therefore, universities make and shape the future startups. The Entrepreneurship Center Network raises awareness of entrepreneurship among students and is an inter-university platform that connects students from different universities and disciplines. It provides them with startup related know-how and useful tools. As the most important platform for students we are happy to have a partner that is focussing on sustainably increasing the number of startups to come out of universities. Finally we want to say thank you: _to all the individuals who helped us over the last 15 months: you are awesome. _to our prime sponsor Internet Foundation Austria (IPA) who supported us in the difficult startup phase. _to all our supporting members who enable us to do our job.

"https://austrianstartups.com/argentinas-surprising-startup-ecosystem/","AustrianStartups","Argentina’s Surprising Startup Ecosystem","Argentina: a country, most people only connect with soy, meat and a number of economic crises. Few would expect the country to be the home of one of Latin America’s best-developed startup ecosystem, and a vast number of highly successful software companies. But exactly this is the case. Argentinian national unicorns range from “South America’s Amazon” MercadoLibre to globally active FinTechs such as Prisma. Another example is Globant, an IT-outsourcing giant counting now over 10.000 employees. And US multinationals such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and IBM are omnipresent in the capital Buenos Aires. What they all are looking for, are Argentina’s highly educated developers and engineers. Tertiary education in Argentina is free of charge and very solid, and while the University of Buenos Aires (commonly known as UBA) counts 300.000 students, in many careers it also ranks 1st on the whole continent. In general, the quality of education in Argentinian universities is certainly on the same level as their European counterparts’. Even foreign students from the Mercosur area are allowed to attend UBA’s courses without restriction or fees, which attracts additional talent from those countries. However, as the country’s economy faces high uncertainty and regular downturns, domestic companies are only capable of employing a fraction of all graduates. In IT, most graduates start their career in outsourcing companies in order to gain experience in various fields but are keen to quickly jump to more exciting jobs. Thus, for foreign companies and domestic startups, it is easier here than virtually anywhere else to find highly educated and experienced talent in the fields of software and engineering. Not to mention the highly favorable Euro-Peso exchange rate, making R&D in Argentina even more competitive. Especially for startups, the Argentinians’ education, creativity, and strong will to take risks provide a more than fertile breeding ground. Modern infrastructure is provided by 50 local coworking spaces, as well as numerous accelerators and business angel networks. To support young ventures, the city of Buenos Aires hosts major initiatives to create additional exchange between investors, startups, and larger corporations. It appears to be successful: while the overall economy may struggle, Argentina’s startup ecosystem breaks one record after another. Every single year. Most important Fields & Technologies Most startups are founded in high-tech fields such as AgTech, BioTech, FinTech, HealthTech, Machine Vision and Telecom. In total, 104 AgTech startups profit from expertise and capital by Argentina’s traditionally strong agricultural sector. BioTech and HealthTech are fueled by entrepreneurial scientists and university spin-offs, and flourish thanks to very liberal regulation. As an institution, the successful public-private company Bionnovo regularly delivers additional breakthrough innovations in the field of Gene-editing. Further, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision technologies strive, profiting from cooperation with present giants such as Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Amazon and Google, and are additionally fostered in the course of Argentina’s designated national AI plan. VC funds mainly from the US have realized the opportunity long ago, and are actively looking for startups to invest in the country. They are also fast in inviting them to San Francisco and Silicon Valley after closing an investment. They compete with regional funds such as NXTP Ventures (FinTech and AgTech) or Kaszek Ventures (Telecom and Software), and corporate venture funds run by national unicorns like MercadoLibre, Despegar and Globant, as well as domestic enterprises like YPF (energy), Litoral (BioTech), or the local branch of Telefónica (telecom). Not at least, Japan’s Softbank recently announced to invest through their Vision Fund 1 bn US$ in Argentinian startups in the years ahead. Public programs exist to match private investments with public ones, thus further increasing the investors’ leverage. Opportunities for Austria For both Austrian startups and corporations, Argentina offers numerous opportunities. While almost all companies struggle to find enough qualified and experienced IT staff and engineers in Austria (aka ”Fachkräftemangel”), these are abundant in Argentina. For startups aiming at developing software, but lacking the necessary staff on-site, outsourcing project-based software development can represent an ideal solution. Highly successful IT-outsourcers like Globant (10.000 employees) or BairesDev (800 employees) proved to deliver custom software at the same quality, but not even half the cost, compared to their European or US competitors. The smallest possible project sizes start at 5.000€. Besides hundreds of US and German companies, also Austrian ones such as Kapsch and Red Bull Media House have already exploited this opportunity. For smaller projects, more than 3.000 local IT freelancer with a fluent level of English are registered on Upwork.com alone. Hourly rates start at 20€, depending on their experience, skills and specialization. Working with Argentinians definitely provides much less friction than in other parts of the world (especially compared to traditional outsourcing to India), since they share our European culture, have a strong sense of responsibility and in general a good level of English. Another option is to directly recruit from Argentina, and invite your future employee to work on-site in Austria, as most Argentinians are very open to travel or migrate. Unfortunately, administrative barriers and visa restrictions still represent a major obstacle in this regard. If you choose to do so, be aware of a long and complex process with an uncertain outcome. After all, a total of only 2.000 Rot-Weiß-Rot cards has been granted per year. Still, a reform of the RWR-card is on its way to take effect by 2020, which will abolish the crippling requisite to prove a confirmed accommodation already when submitting the application. In addition, the minimum salary required will be lowered, and finally, the form can be submitted online. However you decide: for every company interested in Argentina, Austria’s local foreign trade center (AußenwirtschaftsCenter Buenos Aires) offers a free contingent of 8hrs of personalized services to all WKO members and is there to support you. A detailed report about Argentina‘s startup industry can be requested here. The author – AustrianStartups volunteer Philipp Schardax – was in Argentina for two months, working at the local foreign trade center by Austria’s chamber of commerce (AußenwirtschaftsCenter Buenos Aires). He supported the office in establishing a local network for startup and technology scouting, and explored opportunities for Austrian companies in the country.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/people-standing-on-road-beside-market-and-high-rise-1060803-300x225.jpg","November 18th, 2019","en",0.989196360111237,0.000785152369644493,0.905873596668243,0.0287908529862761,0.0645503774285316

In a world café workshop format participants exchanged their impressions from their professional perspective in informal roundtables. Altogether 79 participants took part in eight roundtables comprised of stakeholder groups called Venture Capital, Legal and Tax Advisors, Event Organizers, Public Associations, Educational Institutions, Corporates, Accelerators and Incubators, and Coworking Spaces. The figure above shows the number of roundtables (between 2 and 6) in which a respective topic was mentioned in the discussion between participants about the strengths and weaknesses of the Austrian startup ecosystem. The topics were categorized according to the claims in the AustrianStartups Agenda (https://austrianstartups.com/home/austrian-startup-agenda). Future-Oriented Conditions, Entrepreneurial Thinking & Digital Skills, Public Funding, Austria as International Startup Hub, Political Structures, Private Venture Capital as well as the additional category Startups. The total number of occurrences is broken down by the proportion of positive (green), neutral (grey) and negative (red) comments. The topic mentioned most often (in four roundtables) negatively is the general legal conditions in Austria. On the other hand the extent of public funding was mentioned most often positively (also in four roundtables). What is next?

"https://austrianstartups.com/austrianstartups-stammtisch-79-all-about-growth/","AustrianStartups","AustrianStartups Stammtisch #79: All about Growth","Growth Hacking Management What is growth hacking? Growth hacking is an intersection of product management and marketing. Could be defined as “scientific marketing” –> evidence based –> demands formulation of hypotheses and design of experiments. The ideal background of a growth hacker is IT, a developer looking into marketing (not vice-versa). Simple ways to search for a product’s market fit? Form and test hypotheses e.g. red button, green button, call to action button –> let the data speak for itself! To test a product’s market fit, begin with some research on social media and on e-commerce platforms (views, how many similar products get in people’s “baskets”). What is the connection between growth and failure? “Failure” is part of growth hacking processes but it’s not really a failure –> helps you focus on what really matters. The norm is finding things that don’t work – only 30% of growth hacks really work –> this process informs you on what to keep and what to abandon. What is the biggest misconception about growth? That good ideas apply to any product! Furthermore, people think that growth comes out of nowhere, like it happens overnight –> growth is a process that needs time (see above). It is after it has started that gains pace. When should somebody start thinking of growth? People worry too early about it. Before starting ask yourself: can this product/service grow? Do people look for it on Google? Do your research –> everything starts with the research of a problem and of its solution. What should we look into when problems arise? First of all, the idea should be valid –> go back and interview people, validate, do research for the product/market. Additionally, there should be an endoscopy concerning the skills of the team as well as on other market players. Try to find the bottleneck –> look into the data to find out what’s wrong. Human Resources Management What has HR to do with growth? Hiring is part of every growth strategy –> the product is crucial but you also need the right people to deliver! You will need a small starting team for several years that will eventually lead you into the market and then let you grow. On this smaller size success depends on chemistry, not in special skills – later with a larger team, it’s a different story. The successful team should be a good mix of people, not same personalities –> diversity! How do you understand if people fit in your company? There is never a “right” question to figure this out –> hiring includes a lot of gut feeling! There are pre-employment challenges that test skills as well as tricky questions concerning the professional approach and character of the interviewee (tip when interviewed: NEVER talk badly about your previous employer). When a hire is successful start soon with a personal development plan so people stay with you! Is company culture important? If you don’t like where you work, you don’t do the “dirty work”, so culture really matters. Though, co-founders rush to think too much ahead, and top down –> you have to engage your team when designing the company culture (e.g. workshops) – this process takes time. In any case, at the beginning you need people that will do the “dirty work” –> hands-on approach, not a not-my-task mentality. This is the difference between big established structures (corporations) vs structures in birth (startups) –> people with corporate backgrounds are not easy to adjust in the startup context. How does the recruiting process change overtime in a company? There are different pre-hiring tests depending on the stage of the company –> at first you need generalists/doers, people that want to push things further. As you grow you need more specialists and more experienced people to establish more concrete processes –> you have to think of all the steps that come before you reach 150 people in the company. At the early stage you need young professionals with growth mindset but later you will need experienced professionals – something you cannot afford at the beginning anyway. What happens when you have 40 people on board? This is the time when you need structure –> not everyone can talk to everyone any more –> need for team leads –> team jour fixes. When growing, communication becomes a major challenge and this can be solved by a trial and error approach. How to hire the best person when there are no good hires around? Be creative –> look outside of Austria, Europe etc. In any case, networking/word of mouth is the most important source for finding talent (especially for tech talent). In this direction talk to people and share your ideas and values! Do distributed teams work? You should grow in this direction only when you are really ready. Consider always your resources and if you can use them efficiently –> think thoroughly if you can truly support a team remotely. Take also into consideration the culture of the company –> there is no universal recipe! Conclusively, don’t rush, do thorough research and stick to the data for answers concerning the potential of your product/service and ask whether your team has what it takes to proceed. Keep a trial and error approach to abandon all the wrong hypotheses. Begin with a diverse team with a hands-on approach that fits the startup context, and be ready to set the necessary structures and communications channels as you grow. Talk to people about your ideas and values in order to find fitting employees for your company. And when you are about to hire someone don’t forget to ask yourself: would I go with this person for a beer? Most important of all: keep going and don’t let anybody stop you!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0603-300x201.jpg","March 17th, 2020","en",0.985683739185333,0.00614364747343643,0.881014287471771,0.0242390033672564,0.0886030248366296

Often it depends on your position and role in the ecosystem – a crisis is considered as clear-cut opportunity from an investor’s point of view, but from a founder standpoint it may mean agony and pain. However, different sectors are different realities. As a general rule sales, fundraising and scaling become much more difficult to achieve (capital becomes scarce). All these may translate from time to time in loneliness for the founder – people stop showing up while at the same time pressure is constantly mounting. Stay focused: observe, adapt and your expectations will return rejuvenated! What do you need to consider during the crisis? Crisis periods are your chance to show that you are a truly great founder. Important things to keep on mind: Resilience is the key Creativity wins scarcity Focus on your best resources, especially on your best people Survival is everything Great founders are the ones that they are not only brave to face the challenge, but they also thrive under its pressure! How do founders thrive during a crisis? Mainly by possessing underlying assets which have been built beforehand. Such are: Strong team culture Strong and loyal hires Strong product platform When the above conditions are in place then the crisis becomes an opportunity for founders to prove their business models by pushing sales in sensible ways. The way is paved for growth in revenue but also in staff – what follows after the clouds are gone is that survivors make the most value as competition has been reduced. Is currently a good time to found a startup? Regardless the fact that intuition may tell you differently, this is a great time to launch a startup: Great time for pre-seed investment (low cost risk) No need for revenues No need for lots of employees The crisis is a great opportunity to develop your concept though, provided you observe the new reality and adapt your ideas accordingly. What if you lose investors during Corona? The most sensible or maybe the only way to proceed is to bootstrap your way through the situation. This is no time for arrogance: access your network and try to sale! If you have invested considerable amount of money yourself look for support programs from public organizations with relatively little bureaucracy (e.g. soft loans, finance access with public guarantees). Fortunately, Austria has a lot more safety nets to provide comparatively to other countries where founding a startup is a swim or die situation e.g. USA. What’s more, crowd funding is always an option and last but not least is a scheme where you trade equity for liquidity – don’t get intimidated by the idea because founders are in much stronger position than they think (without them the project will fall apart). What kind of changes should be expected from the point of Venture Capital investments? One thing is certain: there will be a lot of pressure as VCs are currently waiting and do not invest. For companies that were looking for investment rounds aggressively this means necessary change of strategy. Think about how to survive for the next twelve months by finding ways to fund yourself! Where can someone find mentoring during the crisis? To start with in your inner circle, so friends and family that care genuinely for you and your well-being. Of course, on the business side good advice and guidance can come from partners that believe in you and your concept e.g. business angels, professional mentors. In addition, nowadays there are many “unofficial” channels for business communication where you can connect with peers for feedback e.g. WhatsApp groups. The crisis stimulates communication and cooperation, since the same major problems concern the vast majority of founders and investors. Is there anything good about the crisis? Definitely: the tourists will depart. Startup enterprise is not about having fun so investors and founders that do not take it seriously enough, will get evicted by the ecosystem itself. From a time management perspective, founders could/should get the chance to focus more on their core business since lots of distractions are put on hold – time freezes in a way and they can take advantage of it. Another advantage of the current “on hold” mode is that people have more time and they want to use it productively – they are more eager and available to support promising projects. What will be the next day? This crisis will probably be the biggest accelerator of digital change that we will ever see in our lifetime. The key point for success it to lay the ground in order to grow faster than the future demand. It is certain that whoever survives the storm will come out much stronger than before. On the other side, this crisis should not be all about the survival of the digital fittest – other sectors of the economy are equally important in our lives and this is a point we must not forget! In overview Deep crisis –> will clean up the ecosystem from “tourists” Surviving needs also luck –> first and foremost you have to work your momentum hard Surprising but –> this is the right time to launch a startup Crisis –> the largest driver of digitization ever No one is unaffected –> common goal and room for collaboration Now is the time to make things work. Stick to a plan designed to survive and with lots of work your dreams will come up stronger than ever before!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stammtisch-Visuals-80-300x169.png","April 28th, 2020","en",0.994866788387299,0.0256818589696195,0.731618165969849,0.133567679673433,0.109132268000394
"https://austrianstartups.com/change-ahead-austrianstartups/","AustrianStartups","Change ahead at AustrianStartups","I’ve just signed up for my last exam at university. For the ones who had the honour of surviving a “Studentenleben” they know what this means. After realizing what is about to happen soon I remembered that I had planned to be done a lot quicker but some 3 years ago a good friend of mine destroyed my plan by offering me the chance of a lifetime. How it all started It all started when Vlad Gozman asked me in early 2013 if I wanted to co-found an association called AustrianStartups to help startups in Austria. At that point the startup scene was mainly a group of people that all happened to have similar challenges. Pioneers Festival had taken place for the first time a couple months before, 2 Minuten 2 Millionen was non-existent and for most regular people the term “startup” had no meaning at all. It was also the year of “Nationalratswahlen” and the national government showed some distant interest in startups by inviting 2-3 stakeholders in so called “Arbeitskreise”. In fact the startup scene was a small, underestimated and a highly motivated bunch of people who were yet to be discovered by the media and the general public. If you wanted to join “die Szene” you didn’t really know where to go, but had a good start by ending up at the Pioneers Festival. Most of the stakeholders knew each other but there was no one bringing them all together to join forces for a better ecosystem. It was in February 2013 when a considerate number of stakeholders came up with the idea of creating a first-stop-shop for the community which should serve as a neutral platform for the whole startup scene. At that time I had just quit my old job to finish my Bachelor degree and was very much interested by the idea to work on a platform to promote and support startups. Quickly we found other determined people to join the founders team and were convinced a little meetup here & there and some information on a website or social media will do. A typical 5-10 hours a week thing for me they said. Well, it escalated quickly. I think the idea got momentum when we found our first financial supporter, the netidee. That was when I decided to fully commit to AustrianStartups to make it bigger with an already big volunteering team. Making a difference Today I look back completely astonished. Not only was it an illusion that we’d just have a little “Verein” going on but we didn’t see the potential of the support and opportunities for the whole community, startups and stakeholders. Not in my wildest dreams could I have imagined what would become of AustrianStartups and what impact our work would have on real people. What do I mean? At one Stammtisch a startup founder approached me: “You know, it was the Stammtisch that helped me to find out what my startup is all about. You guys provided me with the first support I needed”. I was happy and surprised at the same time. A couple of months later Hansi Hansmann gave some insights on the Runtastic Exit Deal on the Stammtisch and was approached by an Italian developer. 2 days later she was invited for an interview at one of his startups and was hired eventually. We really did something useful that had an impact on people. But beside these real life experiences we soon realized not only on a 1 on 1 basis we could help but also on a higher level. 2 days after we made a proposal to minister Sebastian Kurz about taking the Austrian startup scene to Silicon Valley we were invited to seriously plan that thing. One month later we were already sitting at Google HQ with a selection of startuppers from Austria. Not that we were the first to suggest such a thing but it was AustrianStartups who could realize it, and I was in the middle of it, negotiating between stakeholders, political cabinet members and ministries. It was earlier that year when there was some serious chatter about a new Crowdfunding bill. As usual we talked to the folks in charge and offered the community perspective on things. The minister in charge was Rudolf Hundstorfer, so we asked for a working meeting. We first started with the chief of cabinet and had a profound discussion about why such a bill makes sense, why and how startups have an impact on innovation and the economy etc. I was there with my colleague Daniel and totally amazed: the chief of cabinet was really interested and we could help him understand a lot of relevant stuff. But wait a minute… we were just a community platform and there was an important decision maker willing to listen to arguments and trying to understand more about startups. We were sitting in the bloody ministry and explaining stuff. Wait, something went terrible well here J. The conversation continued and later that year the “„Alternativfinanzierungsgesetz“ (AltFG)” passed. As many of you are aware we have a quite strong social media presence. In our newsletters, Facebook, Twitter etc we put all the relevant stuff for the community. A couple of weeks ago a founder happily reported she really had made some sales because she was featured in the newsletter. There are many more stories like this but it is moments like these that make me realize that we have created something useful. It is very much at the beginning and yet has to improve but we are on the right track. Would anyone of the founders have thought we would discuss with ministers, really have an impact on startups and improve the ecosystem? Me, definitely not. In the end it was the startup community who made that whole thing possible by helping AustrianStartups to promote and support startups in Austria. Startup Scene 2016 October 2016, the Austrian startup community has changed over the years: nowadays it is not about building a local ecosystem but helping to create global competitiveness. It’s more on the international uplink and changing policy & culture and not only providing a common voice within Austria. AustrianStartups has grown over the years from a grass roots movement to a respected player in the ecosystem to act as neutral platform and first-stop-shop. There are big things ahead and great plans already made. My master plan AustrianStartups is my latest project so far for which I worked with an extraordinary team hard over the years to bring this grassroots movement to life. From the beginning of my time in Vienna I was a person to start things, mostly from scratch. I did so to try things, make the first move, beat my own fears & doubts or to show that it is possible. With AustrianStartups it is the same: we had the idea and we tried it, I tried it, and it worked. Even in ways we couldn’t even imagine. But in all my projects there was a certain moment when I realized “it is rolling” and the ground work is done. The perfect moment to hand over. Hand over to someone to take it from a solid fundament and build something great on top of it. I think I have reached that moment: AustrianStartups has become the neutral platform to support the ecosystem with a lot of potential. With my leadership we showed how you could sustain such an idea and what huge potential there still is. I have finished the groundwork and I am up for something new. I am about to finish university and finally able to reach this big big milestone I have been chasing over the years – my university degree.. And with this it is time to move on. Questions & Answers Tough decision? Yes it was. It has been a long process to find out when it is best to leave and hand over to someone else. Until December 2016 I will stay the managing director of AustrianStartups and will then hand over to my successor. Why now? AustrianStartups wants to adapt to the fast-paced changes in the Austrian startup community, to keep serving it the best possible way, while increasing the ties and activities with other European communities. It’s time for the next phase to make the change from a grassroots initiative to a dynamic organisation. I am finishing university and always wanted to bring AustrianStartups to a certain level that someone could take over and make it bigger. The end? It is rather the beginning of a more professional AustrianStartup, that is making the next logical steps. The board and the advisory board – we all have made enough experience to continue the work so that the idea and the vision of AustrianStartups will be worked on. AustrianStartups is a community initiative so it’s again the community to come up with a new AustrianStartups MD. Learnings, anyone? (My very personal learnings which may or may not apply for some of you folks) CEOs/Politicians are humans too: I talked to top CEOs & top political people and found out that they are humans like everybody else ;-). There is no need to be afraid, just be yourself, be well prepared and get your facts strait. Set yourself a goal: when working in a big volunteering team you all need something concrete to work for. Set goals or KPIs so that you can work focused and get motivated when you reach those goals Think about the legal stuff: when starting new things sooner or later you should consider the legal framework. It’s about the team: get the right people around you and do not to be afraid to say bye to people that do not perform or fit in the team. It is better for the person, the whole team, the project and ultimately for you. Honesty pays off: to be true to yourself, honesty to the team and to your customers and partners pays off. At first it may seem weird or even rough but in the end it makes your peers appreciate your decisions even more. My end? #Not. I will see where I will go but one thing is for sure: I definitively fell in love with the startup community. In case you have an exciting project, get in touch with me.

"https://austrianstartups.com/cto-translation-important-code/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #45: CTO? Translation is more important than code.","The trials and tribulations of that ever-illusive Tech… ‘Where to get your tech?’ or as many consider, ‘How far can you take your business idea without a technical team member?’ Both are key questions that occupy founders’ thoughts, opinions are diverse and business growth models vary. My name is Allie and I’m a newbie volunteer at AustrianStartups. Recently moving to Vienna myself, it is a question I asked too when I tried to found my first company whilst at university in London. Still, as a Startup enthusiast and a British native with much to learn, Austria to me is an interesting place to found a company – full of opportunity and from my recent experience, still a deep sense of do it yourself grassroots entrepreneurship which makes me excited about my time here. Last month, I attended my first AustrianStartups Stammtisch #45 where a few methods applied by some well-known startups to the topic ‘tech’ where discussed. Silvia Hecher, Juno Fertility, outsourced with a limited technical knowledge but enough to communicate to a small agency and after the product launch learned that she needed in house. To the opposite, Anyline, having a team of 4 technical founders one of which, Daniel Albertini, was present for questioning. And finally, Fredrik Wendschlag, PAYUCA, a company that was built on an idea with founders from varied background without a tech guy, a bit of self-taught code and now a recently acquired a CTO. Of course, acknowledging that the product or sector the startup is in will ultimately determine tech, the conversation began… Daniel quickly commented ‘Don’t find a tech guy! Hack a version by yourself,’ easy enough for a guy who started a company with 4 tech co-founders to say, no? But he had a point – you really want to at least test the proof of concept before spending a lot of money bringing in resources and technical help. Fredrik, however, nuanced ‘getting the resources of another, either an individual or an agency you get very big very quickly’. Daniel rephrased ‘At least bootstrap an MVP by learning to basic code,’ great idea, yes… and here’s the but… It does involve a commitment to learning which in some cases can leave the Startup worse off, let me explain using Silvia as an example. Silvia led her health tech product with her domain experience, a medical background. If she had decided to learn to code, the time constraint alongside focusing her energy on basic code rather than the bigger picture would inevitably led Juno Fertility down a less solid path. Silvia made sure she knew enough to communicate her ideas with a technical person but didn’t take her learning any further – more time to focus on what she is good at. Best time to bring on technical team members? The general consensus seemed to be after the MVP ‘You can easily hack or bootstrap an MVP with little technical background to test your product’ (this comment was again made by the panels resident tech guy Daniel – however it did seem agreed upon). BUT, before the launch with real customers ‘Out of the study environment and into reality, the product changes, customers don’t always behave in expected ways and bugs will appear almost immediately – at this point you really want someone on the team, outsourcing can mean ‘waiting for days for the fix’ or you also lose the ‘feedback circle’ meaning that a full understanding of the code and system can get lost in long distance communication… Or, lost in badly built selfcode – comments from Frederik of bringing in a technical founder where the system already built and can frankly be a mess. This means a lot of time fixing ‘which created a greater workload than if they had been there earlier on’. So, what do you look for in a CTO? When you are looking for a founder team the ‘fit’ is more important than even technical ability for both the potential CTO and current founding team. The CTO should be ‘more of a translator than a coder’ – there becomes a point in the future where the CTO starts to code less and less, you need someone who ‘understands where the product is going, who can bring ideas to that and also who knows what other talents and skills are needed in the team when it comes to expanding to achieve the goal.’ That said, finding the CTO is a j..o..u..r..n..e..y… and one which does not happen overnight, Silvia advertised for over 6 months receiving approximately 50+ CVs of which she interviewed 7. “I looked for some key aspects during the search ‘Ability to explain and clarity in the product’ someone who ‘believes in the product’ or ‘brings ideas about the code or the functioning already to the interview, already introducing new paths and directions for the company’”…. As you can see, criteria that is not so easy to find on paper… And it wasn’t! After hiring somebody for another role the correct CTO was found in their network. Life hack: Do not despair if you are currently in a ‘no tech bubble’!!! as your idea grows so will your network in a similar way. Other founders from the crowded room also shared their advice, ‘As a CTO you need to be a good communicator.’ Or that also making sure that if you do decide to code yourself, ‘make sure you are aware of and fulfill any Austrian standard rules and regulations.’ And then finally but, perhaps the most interesting question of the evening, ‘Do you have to give away a lot of equity to bring on a CTO?’ – yes the equity so integral to start-ups early stages. Answer: No (phew! To those with ideas but no tech) – However it can depend on how involved the CTO wants to become, for instance where they are in their own career development or as it was also put, ‘if you want an entrepreneurial CTO then that person will tend to want shares.’ Whilst this can be great, due to the person becoming invested in the product and the mindset of the company it came with a warning…. Be careful, and ‘Vesting’ should definitely be introduced – this involves planned equity over time, which even the 4 original tech founders at Anyline had agreed on, a pre-nup so to speak for business marriage. My first AustrianStartups Stammtisch was a success, I learnt a lot and met many other like-minded people in my new home meaning that I can’t wait for the next Stammtisch on the 16th May – ‘How to find the right Investor?’. KEYWORDS CTO – chief technological officerMVP – Minimum Viable Product, usually used with a test group or as initial proof of concept to attract investors.DOMAIN EXPERIENCE – refers to an area of human endeavour, an autonomous computer activity, or other specialized discipline.

What was great, what was missing? Did you find what you were looking for while browsing a store? How easy was it to get support on a purchase you made? Did you discover a new feature after updating your favourite app? All of these experiences have two things in common. First, they can make or break a business. And second – those experiences are all subject of good design. “People are constantly looking for new and better ways of doing things”, according to Katie Dill, VP of Design at Lyft (via McKinsey). Her role is at the intersection of design and business, which proves to be a success factor not only for Lyft. Research shows that design-led companies have 32% more revenue than other companies. Maurizio Poletto, Managing Director at George Labs, is one of the design professionals that transitioned from his role as owner and Creative director of his own agency into to one of the biggest banks in Austria and CEE. Following his desire to make a profound difference, his mission is to help people understand how banking works, making sure they can take care of their money since banking is among the most important things in life “after love and health”. While more and more design professionals that enter the C-suite, it is not really clear what the CDO (Chief Design Officer) is accountable for (read more here). Paulo Ferreira, Creative Director at Braintribe works with people who approach him at a very early stage of a project. He uses his role as an external advisor to challenge ideas from the beginning. In his experience, business and design priorities are often very different. Are CEOs lacking understanding for creativity? Do designers need more training in business and economics? What matters in the end, for designers as well as for CEOs, is the satisfaction of the end-user. Our poll among aspiring entrepreneurs showed that 95% see the end user happiness as the best business decision driver. Seeing opportunity and solving problems are the two unifying objectives of design and business, tackled from different perspectives and with different skills. To generate business value from design, you have to be clear about your goals, needs and available resources: Just starting out with your company? Nothing wrong with templates that can be edited. Unless you have a knack for design, getting professional advice can help you balance uniqueness and familiarity. You want to be memorable when you are scaling your business. Do you want to improve your product and challenge your ideas? Onboarding a designer or agency from the beginning can be a valuable asset, testing and challenging your ideas and goals before going down the wrong road. If the designer has a clear understanding of your business goals, she or he can help you find new opportunities. Do you want to foster a culture of creative experimentation? Think of starting your in-house design department! Look for the right attitude that matches yours and discard factors like age or experience – you might have to do some convincing that working for one company provides many opportunities and is everything but boring. Uncertain times require improved problem-solving strategies. Bringing in different perspectives and skills, like those of a designer, can be the opportunity to find and solve new problems that have not been addressed yet. As Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO argues in this article: “I believe that this moment will turn out to be one where design and creativity show their essential value“. How important is design for your business? Are you implementing creative thinking to your problem-solving process? What is your opinion on working with external agencies vs. having an in-house design department?","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Design_ttt-300x161.png","July 10th, 2020","en",0.997195065021515,0.0643386021256447,0.56681615114212,0.0126624330878258,0.356182783842087
"https://austrianstartups.com/differing-regulations-and-what-we-can-learn-from-n26/","AustrianStartups","Differing regulations and what to learn from N26","Regulations dictate the rules in which businesses have to work within to protect enterprises and consumers alike. However, differing national regulations can be a real pain for startups and can be a significant barrier to global expansion. Despite a high degree of harmonisation within the EU, these variations in rules can slow down expansion and in the worst case halt it in entirely. According to AustrianStartups’ own Startup Monitor published this year 9 out of 10 startups in the country expect to be internationally active in the near future with 30% of revenue being generated already outside of Austria. Of those international revenues, the clear majority are made in EU countries and specifically Eurozone countries. Although physical distance explains some of this, for many technology companies this should be less of a problem. One of the main challenges as stated by nearly half of Austrian startups is that of differing regulations. This is especially true in areas like fintech and health where more stringent regulations require additional licenses. The experience of the digital banking upstart, N26, is a good example of this. N26, a fintech offering mobile banking solutions has successfully expanded abroad and is rapidly becoming a household name in the European banking industry. Founded by Austrians Valentin Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal in 2013 and with over 1 million clients across Europe, the companies’ founders started N26 due to frustrations with the banking experience offered by traditional banks. Among many benefits, N26 makes foreign transactions cheaper and offers a far more user-friendly service. In 2016, N26 obtained a banking license from the ECB allowing them to offer a complete banking platform. Speaking to the N26 team they told me that they did this in order to control a larger part of the value chain enabling them to develop and implement state-of-the-art technologies, launch new products for customers quickly, and be more flexible towards internationalisation. Obtaining the ECB license was a major step forward for N26. At the initial product launch in 2015, N26 (at the time Number 26) cooperated with a banking partner, which provided the infrastructure and the regulatory framework. Back then N26 was available in only Germany and Austria. However, after receiving its banking license in 2016, N26 now can launch products in different markets much faster. With clients in 17 different countries, N26 has successfully expanded overseas, although success outside of the Eurozone will require obtaining new licenses. The company will therefore launch their app in the US with a partner bank and a full license must wait for now. This highlights the regulatory difficulties that Fintechs face but it is also worthwhile acknowledging that Austrian startups should look to take advantage of common EU rules. The rapid growth of N26 is testament to the company’s conviction in what it is trying to achieve but also the effort it has applied to understanding and to obtaining the regulatory licenses it requires. Alex Weber, the Head of International Markets had this advice, “as an entrepreneur, innovator or disruptor you will receive a lot of feedback.

Making money, or becoming rich shouldn’t be on your mind as an entrepreneur – that should ideally be the side effect that will happen if you create real value”. Born to be entrepreneur Markus Linder developed very early on a strong interest for problem solving. Already as a teenager, he got himself into the habit of coming up with a new business idea every day, usually crazy ones, but sometimes also ideas with potential. The beginning Zoovu was his first startup company, a SaaS startup that he launched as a student at the Vienna University of Business and Economics together with his co-founders. His vision? To empower consumers by assisting them in choosing products according to their needs when shopping online. The company grew very fast, raising funds in several investment rounds and gaining more and more customers. Once the company had reached more than 100 employees and grew at a triple-digit growth rate, he decided to hand the company over to a highly experienced scale-up CEO. Markus decided that it was time to move on because sales processes’ optimization and new market entries were not what he is passionate about: “My passion is to build things from scratch”. The great travel(s) Is it difficult or sensible to leave a successful company in full expansion ? This is what Markus did: he stepped down from his operational role at Zoovu remaining as of today the largest individual shareholder of the company – and took a sabbatical to travel. What he experienced during this time are the disastrous impacts of climate warming on nature: glaciers disappearing, extreme temperatures and weather conditions are already happening. It became clear to him that his next challenge would be related to the two greatest challenges of humanity: biodiversity loss and climate change: “I am not sure whether everyone is really aware how dramatic the situation really is. We as humans have brought one million species to the brink of extinction”. As an Impact Investor, he actively supports companies whose business plan is to mitigate these two major crises – “That became a very interesting part of my professional career and my experience as an entrepreneur at the other side of the table”. The comeback It did not take him long to come back with a new business idea tackling the environment crisis. How could he empower millions of consumers who want to have a positive impact on the planet to consume more responsibly? inoqo was born. “Politicians need to do a lot and move the needle massively, but if we as consumers don’t show that we are serious about mitigating these two crises, our politicians won’t either”. inoqo will empower consumers to trace the impact of their purchase decisions, while staying true to their personal priorities and values. Users will get a direct overview of the impact their choices have on the planet e.g. how much habitat they can support for other species by avoiding products with non-certified palm oil, or how much CO2 emissions they have saved throughout the week. Valuable skills What are the skills that Markus came to regard as particularly important in his hitherto entrepreneurial journey? a) Visionary thinking i.e. being able to create business models with a unique vision that tackle great challenges. b) Persistence which means staying focused and embracing hard facts instead of looking for cutting corners e.g. easy exit, and staying loyal to the vision. c) Creating a culture for talent that is, being genuinely interested in the personal (not only technical) development of your people – such an approach attracts great talent. Advice to prospective entrepreneurs “Getting rich should not be the goal but a side effect” – creating value should be at the center of your practice. Before anything else, think how you can contribute to solving really big challenges out there and not how to copy already established solutions. Last but not least “Focus on a business model that makes an important contribution but is also scalable across the world”. “Every tiny little step that each and every one of us can take in our life as parents, as consumers, as employees, as entrepreneurs, as investors, as citizens will be really crucial to avoid the complete crash”. A crucial learning “Being an entrepreneur is important, but other things are important as well in life”. In the early days he used to work up to 80 hours/week but this was harming his passion. Freeing your mind with other things, e.g. practicing Yoga or going for a run early in the morning is crucial – it “helps me make proactive choices instead of floating in the middle of the river or running in the hamster wheel”. A final message “With the things people buy, they vote with their money for the world they want to live in” – right now we vote for deforestation and for the cruel treatment of animals. “The good news is that more and more people are becoming aware of that” and fortunately, this ballot opens every day.

Don’t be afraid of taking risks – there is a solution for everything.” 8 companies. 2 failed (“successfully” liquidated). 1 currently on the best path of becoming a unicorn. Ibrahim Imam, Entrepreneur at heart, father of 2, loves to shape a company with his vision and give something useful (back) to the community. Stick to your domain Ibrahim started young to create side businesses in order to finance his studies in Business Informatics. One was “Lern im Team” [Learn in Groups, Ed.] which was a tutoring school connecting students with pupils to help each other out with studying. Next business pioneered the SaaS space and made it to the incubator of INiTS. Another one was a Food StartUp, which, despite branching out to 3 stores, failed in the end. His advice: “Stick to changing the industry you have know-how about”. And sticking to his domain paid off. Now, looking back at almost 2 decades of Entrepreneurship in Austria, he is one of the 5 Co-founders of PlanRadar, a scale-up PropTech providing services to clients such as STRABAG & Co, and currently expanding to the Nordics, Russia, Poland, France, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, UAE and Australia. PlanRadar is a solution for documentation & communication in construction and real estate projects. The Unique Selling Proposition? Be on-boarded in less than 10 minutes, usable everywhere in the world, and saves about 7 hours per week to the average employee in the construction industry. Digitilization is not a question anymore in times of Corona; “it’s there, people need it to continue with their businesses. Only hunting is less digitized than construction”. Listen to your gut So, how do you get from clients asking to install a CD for your first solution in 2005 to self onboarding in 2020? Ibrahim explained 3 crucial skills: The Selling & The Negotiating: The best idea sold poorly is worth nothing: “Learn everything about selling and generating revenue from along the whole sales funnel.” While it’s crucial in his job to be closing deals, Ibrahim tries not to bargain and rather create a win-win situation through understanding the needs of the other party. The Gut Feeling: Listen to your gut feeling for both decisions and people; then compare the initial feeling to the actual decision taken later on, and learn how to close that gap over the years. “The best part about being an entrepreneur? Being able to learn everyday from smart people, hire them later on, and shape your vision in the way you want it to be.” This same gut feeling should be listened to when deciding whether to take on the entrepreneurial path, Ibrahim advises. “It’s not a 9-5 job – pick something that you love doing and you are really good at or want to be good at, and talk to loads of people who have done it.” While getting their advice, stay critical and check their track record. Then match the findings with the initial vision for one’s life: “You know your personal situation best”. In the end, everyone’s the constructor of his/her own life.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-10-sejla-softic/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #10: Sejla SOFTIC","Name: Šejla Softic Since 10 years: Entrepreneur, Artist, Teacher, Dancer, Choreographer, Dance Educationalist Recipe for success: know your community Biggest motivation: people who count on you Personal life motto: be consistent & write ideas down Meeting the Artist Colorful, homey, inspiring – those three words flash through your mind when entering arriOla association dance studios in the heart of the Viennese artsy scene, or any other of their franchised dance studios all around Austria. Advocate of this atmosphere is the person sitting behind the counter, or rather the bun that I see when approaching the front desk. The person behind the bun looks up, smiles with the brightest grin I’ve seen in months, takes off her black headphones and greets me like she knows me. This is Šejla Softic, an artist through and through. Notorious choreographer, respected teacher, dancer, performer, artist and above all, human being at heart. Her choreographies have filled arenas at the Dance Star World Finals’ Gala Night, Stadthalle Wien, and Dschungel at MQ. How did she get there? Meeting the Demand During her English & Psychology studies, Šejla wanted to do something useful and impactful – she joined arriOla association dance studios as Manager and Chairwoman and has been a part of writing Austrian dance history ever since. Together with Rebekka Rom, who is the Founder of arriOla association dance studios, she followed the scene’s wishes and demands: They first started out by giving dance classes, then raised dance educationalists (Tanzpädagogen), opened Austria’s very first dance-kindergarden (riOriO), founded various artists & talent agencies and established successful competition teams for the World Dance Finals in Porec – the scene liked it, arriOla adapted to the dancers’ needs, and word of mouth did the rest. Leading From the Heart A decade later, Šejla can look back at being the driving mind and force behind establishing a professional dance education in Austria, managing arriOla into a franchise business, and growing the community from the bottom of her heart. “You have to be willing to go beyond regular work hours if you want to succeed and if you want to do as much as I have been doing”, Šejla concludes. How did she build a dance studio almost from scratch? “Everything was learning by doing. Not having guidance made me make mistakes I could learn from and grow.” Šejla never left the teaching side in order to know what’s needed and to connect with the community on a personal level. Consistency, excellent customer service, and a team with the same values that supports each other helped her grow arriOla into its current size. Her secret formula: “Let people be who they are and stay up to date with the latest trends. The rest will follow.” Writing Dance History “Dancing has been my hobby, and suddenly it became my job. Then it became a job that you can offer to other people. Then it grew into something that you can actually commercialize.” After a decade, Šejla realized she’s actually been working all along, despite people telling her to get a real job. “The dance scene in Austria is so small that what we do is still not considered a real job.” They don’t have unions nor special contracts, for instance, unlike other industries where those frameworks exist and don’t need to be built up from scratch. Nonetheless, people love the movement and dancers/artists benefit from it. Every year, five to ten dance educationalists graduate from the KKTP (Kolleg für kommerzielle Tanzstile und –pädagogik) Program laying more ground for the whole industry to grow. Additionally, Šejla offered seminars for Musik Uni Wien, Pädagogische Hochschule Krems et al. on integrating dance into the school curriculum. “Dancing is actually part of the school curriculum. A lot of teachers wanted to learn how to move with their children in the classroom.” The best part of her vocation: “We are still writing dance history. Someone even stated in a press conference recently that Sport clubs (Vereine) in Austria are considered a cultural treasure. Being able to be a part of creating that history for Austria – and the whole scene is contributing – that’s just the most amazing thing.” Surviving Existential Crisis Most dancers/artists are self-employed, so the Corona wave brought a whole existential crisis upon the scene. Šejla had to watch her fellow artists struggle with paying rent the coming month or having false messages circulating in the media. What do you do when your bread and butter comes from working with the community? “Main thing I’ve acquired is listening to myself, to my body and to my mind, and just accepting the way you feel today. Taking it one day at a time.” It was unclear how long the studios will be closed, as dance studios legally differ from fitness centers and also from the classic Viennese dance schools for ballroom dance. While waiting and writing an open letter for governmental instructions, virtual classes have become the new norm. ArriOla was offering online classes for free because they wanted to be there for their community. People who have already paid for the Semester-pass, could ask for a voucher for the following semester, for their money back or also donate the money. Despite the pandemic, the association still had to cover monthly costs. “We are aware that our community is strong. How strong we’ve realized during this crisis. Almost nobody asked for their money back. It was a small miracle. They supported us as much as they could, and still do. In times like these, people appreciate what they have.” #VieDance #VieCare #VieShare Dancing is nurtured by the community and things move fast in small communities. “You can’t be a solo artist in the dance industry all the time, it’s just not right for that. Connecting with other studios is something everybody benefits from. So, together with other Viennese dance studios, we started this movement #VieDance #VieCare #VieShare of supporting our dance community psychologically and physically during Covid-19.” With everything being out in the open on Instagram (and TikTok), the choice of dance classes became endless: “Everything in the world is going more local; the dance scene, however, has become more global with access to teachers worldwide through online classes.” An artist – To be, or not to be The big question mark remains. With the repercussions of the pandemic, should young fellows still follow their dream of being an artist? “Get a back-up plan and be very patient. Try to earn some money on the side. Being an artist is about contributing to the community and giving something of yourself, expressing yourself. It’s not necessarily only about making money. If you don’t have that willingness, then you shouldn’t become an artist. Because that’s what being an artist is about.” In a world where online giants have become the main platforms for artists, how do you generate followers when any artist worldwide is at your fingertips; how do you attract an audience as a newbie? “You have to be realistic. Nowadays, you need to understand economics, be able to work with a smartphone, computer, other artists, and use Instagram as your main platform to reach people. You need to find out what you want to do, what makes you unique. If you want to get started, you just have to do it. In order to do it, you have to formulate what you want to do and writing down ideas has always helped me. Whether it’s vision boards, diaries, to-do lists, calendar entries, recordings – whatever feels good for you. As an artist, just write down and document everything.” Artists Post-Corona? The yearn for culture has peaked during Corona. While shows and performances have been cancelled, confinement has surged – ironically – a cultural desire of the masses. “People have now realized that we are all in the same boat, we all have the same problems, and we all share the same passion. I think this could be a chance for Austria to integrate the dance scene a little bit more into the whole cultural sector. Artists are needed. They will always be needed. But in times of crisis, they are the first ones you don’t want to pay any longer.” Next week: Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger, Erdbeerwoche In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

Are you crazy? Now, 9 years later we’ve managed to educate millions of women, tens of thousands of adolescents, and replaced over 7 Million conventional tampons and pads with organic alternatives.” Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger are two pioneers in Women’s Health: Together they built the social business erdbeerwoche, which focuses on education around menstruation and organic menstruation products. From starting their company 9 years ago to becoming successful entrepreneurs and educating millions of women on the topic of menstruation, how did their journey start, what was their experience like and what is their recipe for success? Identifying a Niche (That Affects 50% of the Population) Before starting erdbeerwoche, Annemarie and Bettina both worked in the sustainability sector for many years, where they worked closely with companies to make them more sustainable. During that time, they randomly came across an announcement from a company that produced organic tampons, and quickly realized that there’s a massive gap and therefore a huge opportunity available in this space: “We wouldn’t have expected at this point that this announcement will change our lives, and will turn us into entrepreneurs.” They went on to do more research on this topic, and “we quickly realized that somebody has to fill this niche – and that’s how erdbeerwoche was born. As a side mission, we also wanted to break one of the last taboo topics of our society – the menstrual cycle.” erdbeerwoche quickly grew to be the first social business in Austria that specializes in menstruation. Their business now includes three key pillars: erdbeerwoche.com, a platform for menstrual education, including READY FOR RED, a digital education platform which teaches adolescents important knowledge about menstruation. For this education effort they partner with public authorities and companies. For example, with the organic pad brand Organyc, where each package comes with a free access pass to READY FOR RED.The second pillar is the erdbeerwoche-Onlineshop, where people can find all organic products that they need during their periods, including organic tampons, menstrual cups, and their self-produced fair trade period panties. In addition, as a third pillar, they are involved in political work where they have been active to lower the tampon tax for many years (which has already successfully happened in Germany) or for more transparency about the ingredients of monthly hygiene products. It Doesn’t Always Matter What Everyone Else Thinks Annemarie and Bettina can show impressive traction with what they’ve built with erdbeerwoche: “Now, 9 years later, we’ve managed to educate millions of women, tens of thousands of adolescents, and replaced over 7 Million conventional tampons and pads with organic alternatives.” The critical voices that they were initially surrounded with quickly understood the value that Annemarie and Bettina were delivering: “Nowadays, we’re no longer being frowned upon, on the contrary – the topic of menstruation has reached a positive turning point in our society, and that’s great!” What made Annemarie and Bettina so successful when building erdbeerwoche? They mention that it is important to believe in yourself and your skills: “Even if people in your surroundings may not always be encouraging, it is very important as an entrepreneur to believe in your mission and to stick to it. But also, to recognize if a path you’re taking is not the right one, and choose another.” When asked about the 3 most important skills as an entrepreneur, Annemarie and Bettina mention “the entrepreneurial thinking, the courage to leave known paths and try something new, as well as grit: Never give up!” The Rollercoaster of Entrepreneurship “The most amazing part about being a social entrepreneur is to wake up every morning and to know that today you have the possibility to make the world a better place,” Annemarie and Bettina mention when asked about the parts of entrepreneurship they really like. However, they also describe the more difficult aspects of entrepreneurship, such as staying positive in challenging times, and finding the self-motivation to push through. In these times, it’s extremely helpful to have a co-founder and work on this as a team, as “it’s easier to get over a crisis when it’s two of you – you can lift each other up if needed”. Overall they describe the entrepreneurial journey as a huge adventure, including a rollercoaster ride: Once the ride is over, you’d want to start again!

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-12-stefan-yazzie-herbert/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #13: Stefan Yazzie Herbert","Name: Stefan Yazzie Herbert Current Position: Co-Founder of House of Bandits Recipe for Success: Creativity, Collaboration and Learning “I want whatever I do to be impactful. And what I can do here is to spread the word of creativity, collaboration and learning.” Necessity is the mother of invention “At the beginning of our entire business model, it was just a couple of friends trying to get cheap rent.“ Stefan Yazzie Herber has not planned to become an entrepreneur, initially. In fact, it rather started with a community of people who were working together and needed an office space. Being creative and bold, Stefan and his cofounder Dominik decided to turn a completely run-down building with almost no infrastructure into an office space – with their own hands. As they were building the space, they have come to realize that it was indeed a business that they could build up. Their mission was about empowerment and growth through cooperation – for everyone. Today, “House of Bandits” is a co-creation space, an advertising agency, and most importantly: a community. Starting from zero When starting from zero, money struggles were inevitable. However, with an entrepreneurial spirit one can always find a way: In order to save money, Stefan and his co-founder decided to make use of the marketplace platform Willhaben and used material at construction sites that nobody wanted. They discovered how far one can get with recycling free things and therefore got the most out of everything and eventually succeeded in building something Learn how to learn, adapt, and juggle As his most valuable skills, Stefan cannot stress enough the importance of learning how to learn and also adapting one’s self-learning accordingly. As an entrepreneur, being confronted with all kinds of situations, setbacks and surprises is part of one’s everyday life. In order to be capable of coming up with suitable solutions, being able to learn new things fast is crucial. Apart from that, Stefan equates his chaotic process with one of his hobbies: juggling – “It’s a habit thing, the longer you practice juggling, the more balls you’re able to juggle. And the same goes for projects. Over time, you’re just able to keep your mind on many more projects. When you don’t have to look when they go up in the air, you can look somewhere else. But when they come back down, you have to be there with your full attention.“ Least favourite failure Stefan had to learn the hard way that substance should come before image when he started a new venture with his business partner Dominik organising a drum&bass music festival “Royal Bass”. Due to ridiculously high expectations, unsolid advice and issues with the local government, the festival got into a precarious financial situation that ultimately led Stefan to be homeless for a short period of time. Nonetheless, it was Stefan’s best business learning he has ever had in his entire life – leading teams, planning festival financials and running international ad campaigns were all tasks that needed to be done and without a full-time team to handle it, it all fell to the cofounders to figure it out on the fly. Even though having unrealistic expectations is a huge part of being able to achieve great things, realistic goal-setting enables efficient planning and is therefore crucial for the success of a project. I want whatever I do to be impactful Being able to create an impact through his work is what drives Stefan to keep pushing, even when facing demanding hurdles. “What I can do here is to spread the word of creativity, collaboration, and learning.“ This is what he values in his own startup. This also applies to other areas than his passion – when thinking about which message he would share on a billboard on Stephansdom if he had the chance to do so, he would call up his friends at Fridays for Future and create a powerful message due to the urgency of the climate crisis. Jump into stuff – if it doesn’t work out, who cares? For getting started, following your own passion or someone else’s is the first step. Through volunteering, participating in impactful projects or even implementing your own projects, one can easily find his or her way into the entrepreneurial world. “Just jump into stuff, see if it works. If it doesn’t – who cares? You’re young, you can still mess up in the beginning.“ Stefan’s jump succeeded and he managed to turn a run-down building into a space full of freedom, creativity and joy with open doors for everyone – feels like everything is possible!

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-13-rebekka-dober/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #14: Rebekka Dober","Name: Rebekka Dober Founder of: YEP – Stimme der Jugend. Youth Empowerment & Participation. Favourite Quote: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea*.” (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry) Pioneering in: bridging generations through impactful participation Recipe for success: Be bold, cheeky, and tenacious. Be empathetic. “What If You Could Change Anything In This World, Where Would You Start?” Almost 2 years ago, Rebekka Dober founded YEP – Die Stimme der Jugend (Voice of the Youth). It’s a social enterprise that, on the one hand, enables institutions and corporations to understand the needs and the mindset of the future generation through impactful participation processes. On the other hand, YEP empowers young people to be leaders of change through teaching them social entrepreneurship. It all started with a simple question Before her time as an entrepreneur, Rebekka travelled the world with a mission where she asked everyone she met the same question: “What if you can change something in this world, where would you start?” No matter if it was Columbia, India, or the Middle East, people answered that in their opinion education is the most powerful leverage point. Rebekkas conclusion: “In this rapidly changing world there are so many problems – climate change, discrimination, wars. To face them, we need a strong civil society. And if we want to transform society, we have to start early – with the youth.” If It’s About Them + Don’t Do It Without Them = The Yep-Effect Between her trips, she was working as an educational designer for different companies and NGOs with young people when she found out that the young people’s answers to that question were never ego-focused, but always with a social, environmental impact. They could identify the worlds’ biggest challenges and create solutions – but felt powerless, because they weren’t able to raise their voice and all the decisions for their own future were made without them. To change this, Rebekka founded YEP. From mission to business Rebekka was astonished how many stakeholders have a hard time to understand this 20 percent of the population, the youth: For politics, they are the future voters. For corporates, they are the future employees and customers. For society, they are the ones who are facing the consequences of the decisions made today. Bringing In The Independent Voice Of The Youth The social startup YEP sets up participation processes with a range of diverse activities: bringing young people on stage to discuss with decision holders from economy and politics, facilitating co-creation workshops, and creating inclusive, “youthified” events to remove the barriers between the generations. The output for YEPs customers: reports to catalyze the needs and ideas of the youth for specific topics like sustainability, new work, and equal opportunities. Within a few months only, YEP has transformed into an active crowd of young changemakers who combine the art of co-creation with society’s actual needs. YEP operated more than 35 participation processes in the last year. This journey brought the 28 year old entrepreneur to events like “European Forum Alpbach”, where she was invited as an expert for youth participation in the educational field to talk about YEPs’ report “Skills to be fit for the future” in front of the economical and political elite. Other successes were bringing the voice of the youth to the Austrian Parliament and the Council of Europe. The “YEP Youth Reports” were presented by highschool students, who were empowered by several YEP-programs that enabled them to raise their voice professionally. Be Authentic Rebekkas days differ very much from one another – the common ground is the stakeholder meetings, conceptual work, and not checking emails first thing in the day. She loves to develop ideas “from something crazy in the head to something down to earth” with like-minded people who give her energy. Be Tenacious Entrepreneurial methods became a way of tackling those societal challenges in the world. “The mindset of a social entrepreneur is her hands-on tool to change the world. I didn’t choose the industry “education”, neither did I want to strictly become an entrepreneur. I just followed my path and my vocation to change the world – and entrepreneurial methods are a way to get there.” Zebras are the new unicorns When it comes to growing her company she sticks to the concept of zebras: Slowly, but sustainable and steady. Without the desperate race of raising investors money fast and eliminating opponents. Rebekka has a strong antipathy against hustling, faking and bubbling entrepreneurs. She wants to grow her business like her personality is: “authentic, empathetic, straight forward – but never forget to also enjoy that chaotic rollercoaster.” Pivoting while lockdown During Corona, Rebekka and her crew co-created the “Weiterlernen Report”, a gap analysis about Remote Learning and the schools’ handling of technologies during the lockdown. “I can’t just sit back and watch. As an entrepreneur you have to be flexible and on point where change is needed. So we started with the ‘Weiterlernen Report’ and instead of a dead end, which Corona meant for many startups, an opportunity arose.” The report was presented in front of the ministry of education, many ed-tech startups and 1000+ teachers. Fighting for a new digital humanism Collaboration is her key to success: “It doesn’t matter if you are a teacher or part of a corporate. We all have the urge for the endless sea*, our mission. The digital revolution is not only about the tools and giving out laptops. It’s about the skills on how to use those devices meaningfully. Digital technology can be a tool to achieve digital humanism.” Be empathetic Rebekka is a mission-obsessed person that puts her team above everything. If someone wants to change something, she suggests to “be bold, cheeky and tenacious, and keep the focus on the mission. If you have an idea and feel the urge to do something and your heart is aching for it, do it. If not now, when then? Always remember, that if you don’t change something, nothing will change.” Next Week: Summary post In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

While studying Communication Design & Advertising at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna she always carried a black book with her, which she used to draw her daily inspirations, ideas, and surroundings into. “It was my visual diary”, she told us. Slowly but surely, more and more people started noticing her scribbles, drafts, and drawings and asked her to draw some designs for them. As time went by, those inquiries got more serious and more demanding, which, eventually, lead her to her first “real“ job in 2010/11 – designing Christmas cookie packaging for Ströck. This was the spark of encouragement she needed to found her own company Atelier Karasinski, in 2012, while still studying. You Need 10 Years to Be an Overnight Success Already having her first clients at the age of 19 and founding her company at the age of 21, Laura has now been in the industry for roughly 11 years. It has been a long journey ever since that was necessary to establish herself as the founder and design director of Atelier Karasinski, a Vienna-based design bureau that specializes in branding & interior design concepts, ranging from restaurants to bars and hotels, and working with a broad range of local partners such as architects, light designers, and carpenters. From the outside it might look like Atelier Karasinski was pre-destined for success; in reality, every single year of preparation, perseverance and patience was crucial for Laura and her team to get to the place they find themselves in now. And we are looking forward to what else the future will bring her. I Do Not Want What Does Not Want Me… …has become some sort of a mantra for Laura over the past few years. “I consider my work life a continuous journey, where life is my teacher and I am a lifelong student. Everything you do, see, touch, feel, learn and everyone you meet is either a lesson or a blessing. And everything that happens, happens for a reason: to learn, to improve, to do better.” As we already discovered from our past interviews of our Entrepreneurs of Austria series, this is exactly the type of mentality pivotal for a successfully trajectory as an entrepreneur in this volatile journey called life. We can’t always control what happens in the world around us, but we can control how we react to it! Practical Tips Laura also shared with us three major skills she has acquired in her life that helped her build her business: 1. Time management – minute-to-minute and day-to-day you don’t have time to think. You need to have already thought. 2. Curiosity – try out new things at least once, so you know how it is like and get help if needed. Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty. 3. Rest – taking one step back can sometimes lead to jumping two steps forward. Freedom Also Means Leading “The best part about being self-employed is the freedom that comes with it”, she told us. She praises the flexibility that comes with it and the ability to (most of the time) choose for yourself when, where and how you want to approach that upcoming task. The difficulty, however, is finding and keeping the right team. Proper leadership is key! Love More… …would be Laura’s chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s most famous trademark, the Stephansdom. To this we agree, Laura! In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-16-sophie-wirth/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #16: SOPHIE WIRTH","Name: Sophie Wirth Founder of: Fitico Sportswear Pioneering in: Sustainable Sportswear Recipe for Success: “Be the change you want to see” “As an entrepreneur, you are willing to take the risk and you take it with joy and happiness“ This week Sophie Wirth, founder of Fitico Sportswear, shared her journey of founding a sustainable startup with AustrianStartups. Being determined to show that a different way of doing business is indeed possible, she created the sustainable fashion label Fitico. In a world of fast fashion and an industry full of grievances, Fitico produces unique sportswear counteracting pollution, exploitative working conditions, and unreliable supply chains – all at once. Important things first When thinking about her most valuable skills, Sophie immediately recognizes and appreciates the strength of her team. “We complement each other very well in our skills“ – while Sophie considers herself as a strategist, her co-founders have their areas of strength in design and marketing. Being a team of founders means to bear all the challenges together and therefore also to grow together. On her path of becoming an entrepreneur, dealing with the important tasks first proves not only to be an immediate stress relief, but at the same time provides a rewarding feeling of achievement, which is especially motivating to go even further. Taking the risk with joy and happiness “As a founder, you don’t have a safety net. You are willing to take the risk and you take it with joy and happiness“. Even Sophie, whose sportswear is made out of fishing nets, did not have a safety net. Nevertheless, she is not afraid of what might happen, but enjoys all the ups and downs as well as the uncertainty that comes with it. Entrepreneurship enables flexibility and also enables having the power to decide on one’s own strategy. This is not only challenging, but also exciting and highly interesting. When dealing with stressful situations, Sophie is well aware of the importance of switching off one’s cell phone and recommends spending time in nature. In order to clear her head, Sophie finds delight in the different view on everything one has while being in the mountains. Last but not least, Sophie experienced that doing sports is also an extremely effective stress-relief and brings great joy – and even more when wearing clothing relieving our oceans of plastic. Building a startup – tackling numerous global issues simultaneously Building up a startup comes with numerous challenges, and making it sustainable, is, of course, another hurdle to conquer. Whether making a real impact on our world’s future is worth the additional challenge should not be a question anymore. After a year of intensive research, Sophie finally found a sustainable fabric consistent with her values and now creates unique and innovative sportswear – tackling 3 urgent global issues at one time: waste reduction, fair working conditions, and dependence on non-European supply chains. This is possible through a special synthetic fibre called Econyl®, which is up-cycled nylon made out of old fishing nets polluting our ocean, and is thus produced under fair conditions in Portugal. Be the change you want to see The corona crisis forced people to hold and to rethink their lives, consumer behavior and daily habits. All problems the corona crisis has uncovered need to be resolved now – by us. Sophie Wirth managed to put people and planet first while building up a successful startup, and therefore paved the way for both innovative and sustainable fashion. “Be the change you want to see“ is what Sophie would share with Austria on a billboard on Stephansdom. She shows us that it is indeed possible to make a change and has already taken a step in the only direction our world can sustain in the long term. If everyone did it – imagine how our future would look like. In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

This is what we believe in and the purpose why we started TheVentury – entrepreneurial thinking and acting upon it is the best way for our society to improve and move forward.” Christoph Bitzner, the founder and CEO of TheVentury, started his entrepreneurial journey at a very young age – he has been self-employed since he was 13. After he founded and hibernated his first growth oriented startup, together with his colleagues he started supporting other startups with his know-how and experience, which was very well received and eventually led to the foundation of TheVentury. Entrepreneurship Means Constant Learning When asked about the best thing that entrepreneurship has to offer him, Christoph emphasized constant learning, “As an entrepreneur you have no other chance than to learn – while the protective layer of a safe job sometimes delays feedback and buries it below policy or false kindness.” According to Christoph, there is no better feedback than the company’s bank account. As for the most difficult aspect of his profession, Christoph deems that is dealing with uncertainty, which, ironically, also provides the biggest potential for learning and constant improvement. No Crisis for Entrepreneurs The core belief that was most useful to Christoph during his journey was the focus on the team: “The Team is Everything.” Particularly, in the light of COVID-19, which posed some various challenges but also an opportunity to showcase their capabilities, “While this is a special situation, as entrepreneurs we are better prepared for it, as we are used to uncertain scenarios”. Other skills and habits he found to be useful on his entrepreneurial journey were to develop a personal daily routine (e.g. physical activity in the morning) to keep a good balance, being vulnerable in front of others, validating and selling before building something, as well as being kind to yourself – everybody fails sometimes. Beware of Advice We also asked Christoph if he ever received bad advice. “Any advice is bad if you follow it blindly”, he shares, “I can only recommend approaching any advice with curiosity. Reflect on where the advice comes from, what experience or data led to the given advice, what viewpoint the person has of what you are doing.” In Christoph’s opinion, this always leads to an improvement of strategy, even if it’s just increased confidence about being on the right path. Progress Through Entrepreneurship When we asked Christoph what text he would put on a large billboard on Stephansdom, he answered: „Progress through Entrepreneurship“– plain and simple. This is what we believe in and the purpose why we started TheVentury – entrepreneurial thinking and acting upon it is the best way for our society to improve and move forward.” And doesn’t everyone want progress?

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-18-tiago-liko/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #18: Tiago LIKO","Previously On The Entrepreneurs Of Austria In March 2020, we – a team of six – have brought to life the Entrepreneurs of Austria series in order to advocate for and foster the entrepreneurial spirit not only, but especially, within times of Crisis and uncertainty. We have portrayed founders from startups throughout various industries, artists, the self-employed, social entrepreneurs, scale-ups and agencies that have one thing in common: walk the stony path of entrepreneurship as an example for others to follow and change things that no one else dared to disrupt yet. They have shared their driving factors behind following their passions with us, their habits, their failures & successes, and have given valuable advice on what kind of skills and mindset has worked for them to achieve the seemingly impossible. As Season 1 is coming to an end, there is still one episode that we haven’t shared with you. How do you choose your career path once you are done with school or university but your passion is something completely different than your academic degree? How do you master the perks of being self-employed for the first time? And this is exactly the theme of our last portrait. So, let’s dive into it: © Aelia & the Camera Name: Tiago Liko Owner of: Liko Films Recipe for success: Be kind. Make a choice, take your passion seriously, and let your work speak for itself. Mantra: Amor Fati. Love your fate. “Certain things have to be in place for the perfect symbiosis to happen.” Make A Choice. After obtaining his Business Degree, Tiago Liko did his mandatory internship and soon realized that working for an incumbent wouldn’t fit his character. “I wanted a job because I thought that’s what I have to do after graduation. Clearly, the thought was not my own.” The lack of knowledge about his work’s ultimate purpose and of the possibility to build something up from scratch was the decisive factor of venturing out into the (yet) unknown. While contemplating that decision, things started to align for a certain path: Left Boy got wind of a music video Tiago had once made, which contained original transitions unique to the music scene. He spontaneously asked Tiago to accompany him documenting his Tour, 13 music festivals in one summer. That had been the inception of Tiago’s passion becoming a reality. Timing Is Everything. Tiago’s story begins around a decade ago, at the time when the DSLR [digital single lense reflex camera] movement was happening and YouTube was in growth phase. Tiago was part of that early movement, and put all his energy into editing, working the camera, and directing. Starting at an early age, there has always been a medium in between him and reality, captured on endless TB of footage. His videos had a unique touch to them, as he was experimenting a lot, luring the viewers’ minds in a cocoon of rhythm and music, highlighting the mood and personalities through sensible storytelling. “Filmmaking is about observing the world really carefully. Deconstructing a situation into its smallest parts; asking why things are the way they specifically are. And then, start piecing together your own stories.” No Need For A Fancy Film School. All the pieces of Tiago’s international life experiences fell into place on its own after following that certain drive, that push towards a certain direction which made him go into complete auto-deduct and learn everything there is about film making. “All my life-energy went into watching & learning filmmaking – I learned everything online, from, and with people. I built my own (online) curriculum and created a learning process that fit my learning needs.” As the jobs kept on coming in, Tiago started building his client base. He took all his work, even the tiniest document’s design and invoices, extremely seriously, and understood his clients’ real needs. Surrounded by the right circle of like-minded freelancers and artists, his videos picked up. “Certain situations, certain things have to be in place for the perfect symbiosis to happen. I picked up a camera by chance. I actually wanted to be a musician. Then I was editing music videos for musicians. Now, I am a filmmaker. An independent, 1 person company.” The Perks Of Being Self-Employed. Self-employment in Austria isn’t served on a silver platter, but the institutions are very welcoming and patient to explain the plain pallets of bureaucracy that are clashing with the colorful joys of self-employment. Tiago’s business studies finally came in handy for navigating through the Austrian self-employment system. While the US emphasizes the spirit of being a pioneer, simply create and make money, Austria is trying to scare one away with taxes and social security schemes. “My dream of becoming a filmmaker would only fail because of not understanding the Austrian system. I had been worried about doing something wrong, overseeing something and making a big mistake, so I asked a lot of questions and researched everything down to the core in order to be on the safe side.” The Element of Surprise. Sometimes life tries to tell you something through throwing obstacles at you. As Tiago was getting used to the rollercoaster of being self-employed and settling into “Austria’s comfort zone”, as many founders and Viennese personalities have described it, Austria’s laws on “Eigenbedarf” thought they’ll shake up things even more for him. He had to leave his apartment, and having nothing holding him back in Vienna, he decided to embrace that new state of freedom and buy a one-way ticket to Bali, see where life took him. “Not having an anchor holding me down, also psychologically, set me off on the right path. It was like a chain effect. Amor Fati, Love Your Fate. Nothing that isn’t positive can happen to me. It felt like the world was telling me something. Comfort is a privilege but also a hindrance from necessity. A lot of big moves that have a big effect on your life are partly made out of necessity, partly of lack of choice. It’s hard to understand your own needs and be impulsive about your life if there’s no push. Where do you jump to if there’s no edge?” Your Vibe Attracts Your Tribe. Bali was the perfect edge to jump off to. Tiago found himself in the right environment for his creativity to thrive. It was there, when the idea of being a digital nomad struck his thoughts, and where the symbiosis made another full circle of magic. “I feel super grateful for people who see my videos and want to get in touch in order to work with me.” Bali brought many positive surprises and set him off on another journey he had never imagined. While shooting for an Australian band, people approached him for an independent Netflix series We Speak Dance. His role as Lead Editor and Director of Photography brought him around the world behind the scenes of a dance community advocating for social change. Jumping into the unknown really paid off his career in the long-term. Fast Forward >> Be kind. Always. Being able to do what he loves and being recognized for his work, is all he could ask for. Despite his big achievements and lots of famous names in his résumé, Tiago remained kind and down-to-earth. He is the perfect example that studies don’t dictate your future, but your choice and willingness to pursue them do. “It’s all about the experience, really. Understand what is blocking you. Make a choice and go for it. Be oblivious to people and thoughts that hold you back.” Adjusting your social life according to your spontaneous work schedule is another learning that one has to be ready for as well as experimenting with trial and error and iterating. “Have a rough mission statement and think about your core value proposition to other people. What exactly are you offering them?” A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. Learning and enjoying the process along the way is as important as having a healthy relationship with your finances and monitoring your thoughts and progress at the end of the day. Sometimes, it also helps to get a part-time job to cover your fixed costs and work on your passion until it takes off. “Don’t sell yourself short, take it extremely seriously, and know your worth. Let people see your value. Be empathetic and never lose your drive. At the end of the day, your work speaks for itself.” – End of Season One.

Being an entrepreneur means learning numerous things every day – it’s like going to the gym: sometimes painful but simultaneously making you feel alive” Entrepreneurship makes you feel alive Entrepreneurship was a start into a healthier, happier and more balanced lifestyle for Petra Boteková. She is a former manager and now successful entrepreneur, who founded the company ReloPilot, which simplifies international recruitment. Even though she now works more than ever, she experienced that “Entrepreneurship makes you feel alive because you are doing something you truly stand for. You can make important decisions yourself, work according to your personal preferences and create your company by your own values. What is more, you are contributing to something you believe is going to make the world a better place – that’s what drives us.“ There are a thousand things you have to learn for your startup – on top of that, you have to grow yourself Of course, the path to getting one’s idea off the ground is not always as easy as it seems. “There are a thousand things you have to learn for your startup and on top of that, you have to grow yourself“ – meaning you not only have to acquire a broad range of business-related skills but also work on self-development in order to be capable of dealing with arising issues. Petra compares building a company with going to the gym. Growing muscles is not easy and there will be painful times for sure, but in the end, pursuing your passion is worth it. For this reason maintaining one’s work-life balance is crucial. Petra found meditating a couple of minutes every day highly relaxing and helpful to cope with uncertainty and stress. By cherishing the little things and focusing on loving the journey instead of the end goals, she aims to enjoy her life to the fullest. Apart from that, setting boundaries between life and work is tremendously important. Petra therefore decided not to do anything work related on Saturdays in order to recharge her energy and remain healthy and motivated to grow her company. Almost everything can be learned online Anything can be learned – whether that’s analytics, people’s skills or public speaking. Petra experienced an extremely high learning curve through creating her own YouTube-Channel BoundaryLess. Both marketing and people skills are crucial to be successful eventually. YouTube helped her to acquire these skills fast. Also, the broad variety of online courses enables everyone to learn any skill nowadays. As for all learning processes, Petra stresses that it is essential to take the initiative and get started – instead of blaming unchangeable factors which are only prohibiting you from moving on and actually solving problems. Look beyond your own borders and challenge yourself every day Petra’s vision of looking beyond borders means much more than just physical borders. It means trying out things, empowering oneself and conquering new challenges. For actually getting started, Petra experienced that a mentor whom you really trust and to whom you are able to talk to about all your business related ideas proved to be invaluable. She explains that “Even if you are young and might feel that you are not experienced enough, you can be a driver of innovation and live your vision. You can indeed always find a more experienced co-founder. Being an entrepreneur also means learning numerous relevant working skills which will eventually help you in every single area of your life.“ Through building her startup, Petra experienced that clarity comes from action and that just going for it is the best way. In the end, being able to grow is the ultimate goal and will eventually lead to success!

Reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey, he is a strong believer of thinking broadly and finding out what exactly is important to oneself and what issues have to be solved in our world. “Don’t start a startup just for the sake of starting a startup,“ Philipp advises young aspiring entrepreneurs. It is therefore important to regard one’s reality with an open mind initially. After discovering your own area of passion, getting to know as many people as possible and reading a lot will help to get your ideas off the ground. Additionally, the value of a mentor should not be underestimated when deciding to build a startup, as receiving proactive feedback from an “outside observer“ might prove to be enormously beneficial. Always in sales mode Being honest and straightforward is the key habit for building a startup – this is what Philipp has learned throughout his own journey. Relying on open communication not only forms relationships which might prove to be invaluable, but also contributes to getting the most out of everyone involved in a startup. Thinking about his favorite failure, Philipp admits that he once did not unleash the potential of one of his employees. As a result, he realized the importance of aligning everyone’s tasks with their potential which has to be discovered through honest communication. Apart from that, as a founder, Philipp experienced that he always has to be in ‘Sales Mode’ – meaning that as an entrepreneur, you always have to sell yourself and your business at the same time. Consequently, in order to establish credibility, structured, straightforward and honest communication is essential. Improve everything but keep the positive core things in mind Being an entrepreneur also means being disciplined and being able to grow continuously. Both asking actively for feedback and being self-critical at all times is crucial while developing a new business. Philipp cannot stress the importance of testing enough. Indeed, testing everything is what Philipp would have focused on more, as one can then analyze the positive data points, stick to them and develop the business accordingly. “Change everything, improve everything but keep the positive core things in mind,“ is what Philipp would use as a guideline for establishing innovation. Do-to-say ratio Because of the importance of the do-to-say ratio, Philipp aims to improve the gap between plans and actions. Focusing on useful and relevant work and actively thinking what is actually achievable is an important step for every entrepreneur. In order to improve his do-to-say ratio, Philipp keeps a list of his pending priorities: instead of distracting oneself with meaningless work, doing the important tasks first is a crucial skill for every entrepreneur.

The co-founder and CEO of “Der Brutkasten”, Austria’s multimedia platform for startups, began his entrepreneurial journey with a side-project for his former employer “Die Presse”. Dejan was more than satisfied with his former employment and admitted he had never seen himself as an entrepreneur running his own company. However, overly propelled by the vision he saw in his project and the yearning for being part of this lively ecosystem of dedicated entrepreneurs, he would spent all his free time developing “Der Brutkasten”. Eventually, he acquired the project from “Die Presse” through a management buyout in 2017. The rest is history. Between Enthusiasm and Doubts Leaving a secure employment and a regular source of income was clearly not an easy decision in the beginning, especially, in the light of becoming a father amidst these life-changing circumstances. It took a decent amount of faith and optimism in order to decide to walk down this unprecedented path. When the doubts dispersed, the enthusiasm kicked in. “I just had to do it!”, the CEO assertively said, “That does not mean that doubts would disappear, however. You just learn to have trust.” The Rollercoaster The period after the foundation was marked by numerous “learnings”. With a cash runway of about two weeks, the company was constantly in survival mode. If the corona crisis had happened during that time, the consequences would have been quite fatal for the company’s trajectory. Did the “survival mode” enhance the performance? “Being with the back to the wall can motivate you tremendously,”, he said, “but it can also hamper your creativity and innovation.” That being said, it did propel him and his team to work harder and they managed to overcome these difficult times. Yet, new learnings keep emerging still. He intentionally calls them “learnings” instead of “difficulties” or “failures” because he is convinced that is what they are. They are supposed to happen for you to develop yourself and the company. It is a constant up and down that lets you appreciate the ride. God Is Love… …would be Dejan’s chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s trademark, the Stephansdom. With the help of his faith and belief, he knows when to listen to his intuition and when to analyze the situation rationally. To my question: “What tip would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs?”, he emphasized the importance of having a fervent passion inside, something you are truly convinced of. Once you have that, however, “Be rational about it. Ask yourself if you are actually solving a problem with your business idea. Exchange your thoughts and views with people that support you in your analysis. Find the balance between the heart and the mind.” Next week: Philipp Stangl, Rebel Meat In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

I believe that art is like a global language, which connects everyone, regardless of your religion, your language, your age or ethical background.” “Music has always been a part of my live” One of the reasons, why little big art is such an authentic organization, is that Frank himself is a musician through and through. His musical journey started at a boys’ choir, where he became a soloist singing opera on many different stages, from Israel to the US. At the age of 16, he got into deejaying, where he realised that it is possible to build a career around his passion music. “You have to swallow a lot of shit. That’s why persistence and stubbornness is a skill you need as an entrepreneur.” Frank’s time at the boys’ choir, where he constantly had to adapt to new situations and countries, laid the basis for his later success in the world of entrepreneurship. As a founder, you need to be adaptive and very flexible to survive in a world of uncertainty and constant change. Another skill Frank developed even further during his time as an entrepreneur is endurance and persistence. “Starting your own startup, you have to be persistent and stubborn, because you have to swallow a lot of shit. Further, you should not be afraid of those setbacks that you have throughout the time. Always be persistent and believe in the vision.” Especially in difficult times, a clear vision for yourself and your team is what keeps you going. “We believe that art is like a global language, which connects everyone, regardless of your religion, your language, your age or ethical background” Frank’s mission is to bring people together through art and also create value with his work. Everyone throughout the world should be able to experience intimate concerts and art experiences no matter where they are. “With the current Corona situation, all our live experiences were gone at once” Especially the art industry was affected by the Corona crisis. The whole platform and business model from Little Big Art were built upon live art experiences. But with the current Corona situation, all of a sudden, all those live experiences were gone within one day and the platform was empty. Instead of being desperate about the crisis the team adapted to the situation and featured digital art experiences like live drawing sessions, live readings, live concerts. “Out of this crisis, there are a lot of new possibilities emerging especially for the cultural sector.” “I believe that in the future, there will be more mixed forms of art experiences. Like an online guitar session or lesson, live stream events that can be seen via virtual reality or augmented reality.” Frank points out that people of the western world get used to things we only knew from the Asian parts of the world like micro-payments for small and virtual services. In his opinion, the crisis has also positive side effects, like the willingness to pay or tip for digital events or the possibility to open up the audience of the artists to other markets. The former Freilich Open Arts and now Little Big Art platform shows that the flexibility and the adaptability to ever-changing circumstances is a key success factor for startups. Although the startup is working in one of the sectors that have been hit hardest by the crisis, they remain forward-thinking and see change as an opportunity and not a reason to fail.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-7-stefanie-bramboeck/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #7: Stefanie BRAMBÖCK"," Portrait Name: Stefanie Bramböck Current Position: CEO of discovering hands Austria Focused on: Social Entrepreneurship in Healthcare Recipe for Success: Think fast on your feet, improvise and adapt quickly “It’s amazing to be an entrepreneur. Of course there are difficulties, but for me the positive aspects outweigh the negative. I did not have a planned way into entrepreneurship, it just happened at the right time. I would definitely recommend to everyone to start their own business once in their life because it’s a new aspect of life. You get to know a new perspective, you learn. Everyone should start a little idea.” Stefanie Bramböck joined discovering hands Austria, a social impact company, in January. “I did not plan my way into entrepreneurship, it just happened at the right time.” Having worked in PR, marketing, and agencies before, the arrival of her son changed everything for her, as she was looking for more flexibility and a way to create greater impact. discovering hands – A Win-win Situation When she heard about discovering hands, “I knew exactly that this is what I wanted to do now, that this is the right time for me to go into social business and to become an entrepreneur.” discovering hands, originally founded by Frank Hoffmann from Germany, is a social business active in the early detection of breast cancer. Breast cancer affects one of eight women, and discovering hands trains blind and visually impaired women as Medical Tactile Examiners (MTE), as their elevated sense of touch helps discovering breast tumours early. discovering hands also trains women on how to conduct the monthly self examination at home, which can further help with the early detection of breast cancer. Changing Conditions and Stefanie’s Recipe for Success A couple of months into her role as CEO, the impact of the Coronavirus changed conditions for discovering hands Austria massively: As close contact and touch was required for the breast cancer examinations, the distancing rules were impossible to follow for discovering hands, and all in-person courses for self-examinations were suddenly cancelled. Also, the discussions with the Ministry of Health to approve Medical Tactile Examiners (MTEs) as a recognized profession were put on hold, as the Ministry of Health had to fully focus on the new evolving situation with the Coronavirus. Stefanie and her team decided to start a crowdfunding campaign, which was successful: “I’m a fan of crowdfunding for investment. In addition to the financial support, we gained increased attention and new cooperation partners with our campaign, such as the “Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen Österreichs.” The past couple of months have taught Stefanie a lot about leadership: “Leadership for me has two aspects – you have to set the path as a leader, come up with the plan on how we can reach our goals. But you also have to inspire people, bringing them along on the journey, and convincing them that the path we’ve chosen is the right one.“ The Power of Improvisation One aspect that prepared Stefanie for entrepreneurship was jazz: “I’m a jazz singer, and especially in jazz music you have to improvise. You play together with a lot of different people, and you create something new together that has never existed before”, explains Stefanie. “At the end, it comes down to the ability and the skill to listen. You have to adapt yourself, work with the music the other musicians create in the moment, do something with it and develop it.” Improvisation, which is common in jazz, can help in business, especially when structures are not fully clear yet, as in any startup, and when you have to adapt fast to changing conditions. She also draws parallels to jazz when it comes to collaboration: Musicians are used to playing together even though they may have never met before, they can be old or young, from different backgrounds and skill levels. With only a set of rules that everybody is familiar with and a goal in mind, something new is created. This skill to think fast on their feet, adapt and improvise helps her and other musicians in their daily lives in business. The Ups and Downs of Entrepreneurship When asked about what Stefanie likes most about entrepreneurship, she mentions the freedom “to find my own ways and solutions, to find my style or way of doing things.” Together with her team, she finds new approaches to best reach their goals, and has the flexibility to work from either her home or the office. Stefanie also enjoys getting to know new people and growing her network, although this has been more difficult in the past months due to Corona. Stefanie also tells us about facets of entrepreneurship that have been difficult for her. For instance, paperwork and bureaucracy – “I’m not used to it, because as an employee, you don’t have to do it.” Also, being the CEO can sometimes feel very lonely, as there’s not always a sparring partner around: “I have to take my decisions on my own sometimes, and I would love to talk more about the topics and the challenges with others, but as an entrepreneur, especially in a small enterprise, sometimes you’re very alone in your thinking.” Although Stefanie didn’t plan her journey into entrepreneurship, she “would definitely recommend to everyone to start their own business once in their life because it’s a new aspect of life. You get to know a new perspective, you learn. Everyone should start a little idea.” And especially when conditions change rapidly, we should improvise more. Just like in Jazz.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-8-christiane-holzinger/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #8: Christiane HOLZINGER","Name: Christiane Holzinger Entrepreneur: since 12 years Speciality: (digital) taxes & business planning for startups Recipe for success = [(Be focused + Be disciplined) x good network]^be authentic Personal life motto: Be fla-mazing “It’s the best time to create a new business because there will never be more support. Invest in your personal development. In the end, we can only rely on ourselves.” Inception. Having been raised in an entrepreneurial family, Christiane decided to jump into entrepreneurship herself and founded her own digital tax consultancy company. “I wanted to rely on my own ideas. What’s the worst that can happen? The worst is that I don’t succeed and I lose my personal savings.” She hired her first experts to do the marketing and organizational management of the company, so she could focus on her strengths and be out there acquiring clients and generating revenue. 12 years later, she runs two companies (360 Business Planner and StartUp Stars), is the National President of the Junior Chamber International and Junge Wirtschaft, and the Deputy Head of Carinthia’s Federal Economic Chamber. At the latter, she makes an impact giving feedback on how to improve the situation and the entrepreneurial spirit in Austria. Christiane’s main focus is digital tax consultancy – perfect for traveling since nothing gets lost, and on top, it’s environmental-friendly. Her passion for the world combined with her international experience come in very handy in all her roles. Deep learning, becoming an expert in her field, the right people around her, and very hard work, especially in the first years of establishing her business, was crucial to successfully establish herself in a man’s industry. Why Taxes Are Sexy. Let’s be honest: There’s no entrepreneurship without taxes. Everyone needs a good tax advisor. “Working with taxes is like solving a riddle. You have to find a solution, be smarter than the rest to find the right strategy, and it’s actually sexy when you save taxes. At least my clients tell me this”, Christiane laughs. Masters are made not born. It takes a long time to become an expert and Christiane worked in various positions to acquire the necessary skills and to see how different areas and tools such as accounting, payroll, and controlling interrelate. “If you know the whole strategy, and you know how to play the game, it is a very cool job.” What Is Success? Christiane loves what she does. In fact, she considers her employees family, and her pink office her living room. Therefore working feels more like a hobby: “Working with taxes came very naturally to me. It was easy to handle the questions and tasks when I first started.” Communication skills, persistence, and persuasiveness are essential when she works closely with (tax) authorities that have very strict plans and ideas. Due to her international experience and mindset, Christiane never regrets anything and lives by a daily routine. Her motto is “reaching 50% of a very high goal is better than reaching 100% of a very low goal.” When doing business, her employees, her team, living quality of her team, and communication with clients are the most important factors to her. All this combined gives her “the energy, the learnings, the good times, the laughter, and everything that comes with it when you are an entrepreneur.” Furthermore, Christiane draws her success mostly from the people she surrounds herself with: “Surround yourself with people who have the same spirit, mindset, and above all, the same values.” Be Authentic, Be Fla-mazing! Authenticity resonates with inner happiness, which results in good business. Inspired by a conversation in Florida, Christiane sees herself as a flamingo who is happy because of everything she absorbs, learns, and surrounds herself with, e.g. the positive working environments. Why? Flamingos turn to the color they absorb, eat, or see. That’s why they turn pink: “Be authentic. Look at the strengths you have and start from there. Focus. Don’t try to copy others. If you fail, and if you are a hard worker, you’ll reinvent yourself. However, be prepared to work harder than others in a male business as a female founder. Don’t overthink what the rules are in business and be yourself. I also thought: It’s my office, I’m my own boss – if I want to wear dresses and flip flops or be barefoot, I’ll just do it. If people don’t like it, I don’t care. It’s not about my dress code but about the results I deliver to my clients.” Observe The Market & Invest In Yourself. Christiane recommends the book “Non-obvious” by Rohid Bharghava, whom she met last year: “As an entrepreneur, no matter what you do, you should always observe what’s happening. Being flexible and adaptive is what we see right now, in this time, the most important skill for an entrepreneur.” Personally, she envisions the future as very positive despite some hard years ahead. “Human kind has always survived crises. Why shouldn’t we survive this crisis? Crisis is very important for innovation.” The time to change and adapt to our environment is now: “It’s the best time to create a new business because there will never be more support. Invest in your personal development. In the end, we can only rely on ourselves. Read a lot and structure your day. It doesn’t matter where you want to be in the future, just try to imagine how you will feel when you reach our goal.” Next week: Eugen Prosquill In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-special-edition-hannah-wundsam/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs of Austria #Special Edition: Hannah WUNDSAM","Portrait: Hannah Wundsam Position: CXO at AustrianStartups, Co-founder of rePhil Focus: Social Entrepreneurship Recipe for success: Be persistent “Entrepreneurs are people who develop projects and implement solutions to problems that concern their communities.” Passionate social entrepreneur; actively seeking to help people who want to make an impact; CXO at AustrianStartups and Co-founder of a startup – this is Hannah Wundsam. What primarily attracted her in entrepreneurship is that “you can create impact by implementing your own ideas.” Her vision? The cultivation of an entrepreneurial mindset among the Austrian youth via the educational system. Entrepreneurship and Authority For Hannah it all starts by creating a certain mindset – entrepreneurship is all about being solution-driven and not problem focused. This is the Alpha and Omega of the entrepreneur’s worldview, to perceive problems as opportunities. “The current school system provides binary frames for handling problems: you can either be right or wrong, and the answer depends on the judgement of an authority.” What needs to be done is to help people see the opportunities and master the skills they need to realize solutions. This is why Hannah’s next chapter within AustrianStartups will focus on fostering entrepreneurship in schools. Who is an entrepreneur? She holds a very inclusive understanding towards entrepreneurship – “It is not about tech-ies who want to be the next billionaires.” Entrepreneurs for her, are not only the founders of companies, but also people who develop projects and implement solutions to problems that concern their communities. Creating a legacy During her exchange semester in Australia, Hannah realized that she can link her Business studies to her impact-driven ideas, “to combine the impact world with the profit world.” Coming back to Vienna determined, she decided to take a deep dive in the field – Impact Hub; student centers for innovation; innovation agencies. Along these experiences rePhil was born, a circular system for take-away packaging – “You may not be able to be 100% sustainable but you can make sure that your own footprint is a positive one and thus, leave a positive legacy behind you.” Women and men entrepreneurs What are the differences between men and women entrepreneurs? According to Hannah you cannot really make clear distinctions – it’s not an issue of nature but rather of nurture. Gender as a natural category has not much to offer here. On the other hand, from her experience it is easier to find men than women entrepreneurs to fill a stage panel. It comes back to education: Girls should be more educated on the opportunities out there because there truly exists a mentality that wants to foster women entrepreneurship and leadership. “For women with ideas, this is the right time to step up!” Bring down existing obstacles! “The ecosystem is still relatively small and people are very eager to support and work with each other.” Though, Hannah believes that there are still barriers that need to be brought down for further development – the general mindset that you need money to found a company; the complicated system of services and organizations that leave people unaware of the opportunities out there; the scarcity of Venture Capital in Austria. The entrepreneurial toolkit Do you want to be an entrepreneur? Here is what Hannah considers as essentials: Learn how to present your ideas in front of a big crowd – nobody is good at pitching an idea from the very beginning but this is something you can definitely learn! Train yourself in motivating or inspiring others to believe in your idea. Be persistent – talk a lot about your ideas to others but always take feedback with a pinch of salt. Find ways to believe in your projects when others are skeptical and follow-up when for whatever reason people don’t get back to your requests for a meeting: “You will be surprised how far this can get you – that’s how we got our first pilot at rePhil.” Find a way to divide your time to different projects effectively. Though, don’t neglect to shut off and take breaks. Running outside or enjoying nature may be where you come up with your best ideas! Bonus tip: “Have people around that give and do not drag energy from you.” This is especially important when building a team. Always keep in mind… Don’t be shy to follow up. “Go out and talk about your idea, every opportunity is a pitch.” Take feedback with caution; everybody will tell you their own opinion but you will decide which of these you will integrate and which not. People think that someone who is older in the field gets everything right but this is not always the case – in the end “everyone cooks with water.” It is you who need to decide how you want your product or service to look like: be brave to make the decisions. “Follow your gut!” In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-specialedition-3-most-valuable-skills/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs Of Austria #Special: The 3 most valuable skills for building a successful business","In our “Entrepreneurs of Austria” series, we’re interviewing entrepreneurs to learn more about their journey, experiences, and learnings. One of the questions we were especially curious about were the most valuable skills for building a successful business. Can these skills be learned, or are there even traits that entrepreneurs are “just born with”? How can we all make use of these skills to become more entrepreneurial in our daily lives? In the 15 interviews with the entrepreneurs of season 1, we’ve discovered patterns of valuable skills of entrepreneurs. They range from advice to trust the gut feeling to interpersonal communication and sales skills, self-adaptation, time management and planning in enough time for rest to reset and reflect. The 3 most valuable skills we’ve identified for building successful businesses: #3: Quickly Adapting to Changing Situations In entrepreneurship, no day is the same. Every day brings new and unexpected challenges, and things might be moving very quickly: From signing new customers on Monday to difficult calls and decision making on Tuesday, every day varies greatly, and is part of the emotional rollercoaster entrepreneurship is often compared to. Being comfortable to adapt quickly to changing situations and pivot where needed is one common topic that we’ve seen in our interviews, and prepare entrepreneurs to stay flexible and adapt in a world of uncertainty and constant change. #2: Courage Entrepreneurship can be difficult and scary. It’s walking an unbeaten path that nobody has ever taken before, and nobody knows its final destination. Courage is key in entrepreneurship. Going from a stable paycheck to exploring, learning, and building a company is a big decision: Entrepreneurship is risky. Taking the decision to venture into entrepreneurship requires courage, which was very often mentioned in our interviews and seems to be one common trait the entrepreneurs shared. #1: Persistence Persistence seems to be the number one skill to master in entrepreneurship. Even if one might be facing difficult times, having the grit to pull through, find a way out, analyze the situation and pivot is key for success. Isa Watson, a US-based founder, describes the feeling of Entrepreneurship in what we believe is a very accurate reflection: “Being an entrepreneur is just literally mastering how to stomach the feeling that things are falling apart and coming together all at the same time.” Persistence, or the unwillingness to give up in difficult times, can really make a difference to push a company ahead in their path towards success, and is a key skill our entrepreneurs have mentioned when building their businesses. Successful entrepreneurship seems to align around these 3 key skills – quickly adapting to changing situations, courage and persistence. Do you agree? What do you think should have made the list?

"https://austrianstartups.com/entrepreneurs-of-austria-specialedition-top-5-reasons-why/","AustrianStartups","Entrepreneurs Of Austria #Special: Top 5 Reasons “Why”","Why Did They Become Entrepreneurs? In the course of our interview series since the initiation in May, we were able to make out some interesting commonalities between the interviewed entrepreneurs. They often resemble in various aspects – from their why’s to their circumstances of their inception. This blog post covers the top 5 reason why our already 12 interviewees chose the entrepreneurial path. #1 – Doing It Your Own Way The reason that almost everyone shares is that for entrepreneurs typical “Do It Yourself” – approach. Phrases like, “I like to be my own boss and make important decisions myself”, were repeated quite frequently. We were not overly surprised by that, since for founding your own company and introducing your own product or service to the market you have to rely on yourself. As every startup or entrepreneurial foundation is different, there is no exact instruction manual given. Of course, you can learn from existing professionals in your field acquire all the tips and advices for certain situations; however, when it has to get down, you have to be self-reliant and proactive. Traits that are absolute musts for every entrepreneur. #2 – Follow Your Calling Whether they named it calling, passion or purpose what most of our interviewed entrepreneurs have in common is their underlying enthusiasm for a greater cause. Some even mentioned words like, “meant to do it”, when we asked how they overcame their doubts of starting out. We believe that inner certainty that things will work out is crucial for getting past the first few hurdles that will be set in your way. #3 – Solve a Problem Often our entrepreneurs discovered room for improvements in certain industries that have to be addressed. Whether it was Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger of Erdbeerwoche, Rebekka Dober of YEP or Philipp Stangl of Rebelmeat, just to name a few, they all wanted to innovate or develop a product and, hence, contribute to society. They realized it was not about them but rather about the problem they wanted to solve. Still knowing the problem is one thing, actually coming up with the solution and acting on it is a whole different conversation! #4 – Do It Out of Joy “I want to create cool things and in order to do that I need to develop as a person”, Eugen Warda of Wardanetwork said, for instance. Having joy for the work you do as the impetus for improvement is key. Similar to “follow your passion”, if you stand for an idea or find the thing that excited you and make it your job, you will never have to work a day in your life again. Sounds cliché, but it’s true. In the initiation phase you have to put the work in and unless you’re not one hundred percent behind your project, you will lose enthusiasm and quit. As opposed to this, if you love what you do, you forget to count the hours and end up burning the candle at both ends until the job is done. #5 – Don’t Do It for the Money Do it wholeheartedly and with love to the detail and the money will, eventually, follow! What every entrepreneur agreed with is that money shouldn’t be your number one drive. Choosing the quick paycheck over the project and outcome that you really desire might be appealing in the short run, but in the long run it will let you neglect and forget the reason you wanted to become an entrepreneur in the first place. Paradoxically, by not putting such importance on the return but focusing on your idea, your product or service, you will do your work with diligence which again benefits the quality of your product or service. The better those become, the higher the demand will be there for your work! In our weekly interview series, we will be featuring various inspirational entrepreneurs of the Austrian startup scene.

Today, we are launching a new project: portraying Entrepreneurs of Austria. Have you ever had a dream, a vision, an idea and were unsure or afraid to unfold it? By “sketching” portraits of Austrian Entrepreneurs, we want to inspire pupils, students, enthusiasts, aspiring and established entrepreneurs, and everyone alike, to take a leap of faith. We want them to unleash the most entrepreneurial version of themselves. The portraits will provide a glimpse into the minds of Entrepreneurs in Austria, their lives, their unique experiences, successes, painful detours as well as advice to others. Reading them shall evoke passion, inspiration and courage to every one of us in order to pursue similar dreams – hopefully these brief stories will foster an entrepreneurial mentality to more people in Austria.

While everyone else programmed devices like stopwatches or calculators, the future CEO of Warda Network thought of creating something more lasting. An event photography website was the result. “I wanted to save some money when going out,” he stated bluntly. The time he spent on his project during school inevitably affected his grades. Whether that was good or bad, he could not tell. He just knew that he had to walk a different path, which, to the concern of his mother, forced him to drop out. However, what school did not recognize was his creative ability and marketing understanding. Soon he was introduced to like-minded people and after one thing led to another the core of his agency was born. “A lot has happened since then,” the now 31-year old “Chief of Everything”, as he titles himself, says nostalgically, “but to be honest, we should have done more.” Half a decade ago, Warda transitioned to Warda Network, a creative marketing agency that is known for breaking conventions. If You Don’t Expect You Can Make It, You Won’t Compared to his 18-year old self, Eugen operates way more strategically these days; however, always by being authentic to his core principle: Enjoy what you do. Eugen’s mentality consists of a blend between an inner curiosity for new creations and an unwavering self-esteem. It is his job to come up with ideas and he does not shy away from executing them. Trust is key. “Trust people, trust business opportunities. Skepticism and second-guessing don’t get you ahead,” he adds. You Have to Face the Bad In Order to Know the Good Eugen has never attended a university lecture; however, he acknowledges the importance of learning. Instead of locking himself inside libraries and delving into theoretical literature, he considers life as the greatest teacher and failure as his greatest lessons. Commenting on the obstacles he faced in the business world, he said, “You have to get to know bad people, in order to find out who the good ones are – sometimes it takes certain failures to recognize and appreciate times without hurdles and hassles.” Motivated by Joy Already 13 years in the industry, and still with the same hunger as when he has started out. How? Eugen’s kind of motivation comes intrinsically, “I want to create cool things and in order to do that I need to develop as a person. Of course, there are different phases. Sometimes you just want to prove something to yourself. At other times you have different priorities.” Even though the CEO does not cherish stagnancy, he emphasized the importance of pauses, especially in the creative sector. He seldomly feels pressure on his ability to come up with ideas because he is convinced that he can rely on his team. Still he does not deny his responsibility as a CEO. “Being an entrepreneur is not always as fun as it might seem. You are a trendsetter, a leader that has to stand his ground, a mentor, sometimes even a psychologist to your colleagues.” On the other hand, he praises that his job does not exactly feel like one. His friends would see him on Instagram and would not understand that he is actually working. Work-life balance? Is no issue, as he can design his week to his liking; thus, rarely missing out on family time. His brain always works, though. “Last week I was on vacation with a couple of friends, and we invented a board game. We are currently pondering on whether we want to launch it commercially or just produce 100 pieces for ourselves.” Madness Meets Genius … are his chosen words for a billboard on Vienna’s Stephansdom. Any background picture for it? A photograph of the entire team. “That pretty much sums up what the company stands for,” he comments. To my question whether he is concerned that other people might regard some of his ideas as too risky, he merely answered, “What we do at Warda makes sense and if it is necessary to be crazy or mad, then, that is exactly what we have to go for.” Eugen does believe in destiny which endows him with a sort of serenity when it comes to his decision making, “You cannot always control everything.” His final advice for aspiring entrepreneurs would be, “Don’t do it for the money. If you do it out of joy and it’s the right idea, the money will follow, eventually”.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Eugen-Quadrat-300x300.png","July 6th, 2020","en",0.991539180278778,0.0959879123438441,0.594295114278793,0.252968311018776,0.0567486733198166

This month’s Stammtisch was all about celebrating the past and thinking of the future. written by Nicolas Kristen First of all, if you couldn’t make it to this month’s Stammtisch but want to re-watch the whole thing click here – we had a livestream! Now, let’s get to recapping. AustrianStartups held its 50th Stammtisch and as some of you may remember, things have changed a lot since the first Stammtisch where people were still sitting around an actual table. This would not have been possible without our supporters. So thank you all! How to build the Future: The Austrian Startup Agenda So how’s the future of the Austrian Startup ecosystem going to look? Well nobody can see into the future but one can definitely try to change it. So after three months in development, working with 50 experts, we’re ready to announce the Austrian Startup Agenda. Why you ask? If you’ve ever founded your own startup, you will probably agree that it can be quite challenging at times. And while we believe that overcoming these challenges is vital for developing as an entrepreneur, we also believe that there’s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to regulations, research, funding and education. And improving these areas will be vital if the Austrian Startup community wants to compete on a global market in the future. Over the course of these three months we settled on 36 recommendations divided into six areas we believe need change to ensure a competitive Austrian Startup ecosystem: Education and research, legal conditions for entrepreneurship in Austria, private risk capital, public funding, Austria’s international positioning and the relationship between political institutions and entrepreneurs in Austria. So that’s where you, yes YOU, come into play. Because we need your feedback to further prioritize what’s important for Austrian entrepreneurs. And that’s what Stammtisch #50 was all about: Getting your feedback and exchanging ideas. If you didn’t attend the Stammtisch we highly recommend you read up on our Agenda here and vote on the five demands you think are the most important for the future of startups in Austria. So do the right thing and help us improve Austria for future entrepreneurs and maybe even change the world a little bit. Like our CEO Markus said: “Every one of you here can change the world within the next few months”. So get to it and see you at the next Stammtisch!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21686896_10155856057592033_8013359824579460695_o-300x200.jpg","September 29th, 2017","en",0.975629806518555,0.00571821816265583,0.505536079406738,0.0176842957735062,0.471061408519745
"https://austrianstartups.com/farewell-vlad-welcome-katharina/","AustrianStartups","Farewell Vlad & Welcome Katharina","I’m not gonna lie – when putting up my first post in the private AustrianStartups Facebook group in late 2012, I had no idea where this community initiative would end up. And frankly, I still don’t ? But that’s a good thing! Because AustrianStartups has and always will be what the startup ecosystem at a certain point in time needs it to be ? Let me back up for a minute and fill you in on our short but eventful history. See, back in 2012 I had joined forces with Markus Wagner at i5invest, when it was still a startup factory, and in a flash, the whole startup ecosystem opened up right before me. Though calling it ecosystem seems now out of place when thinking of the scene’s infancy. You see, startups were still a relatively rare breed, mingling on pretty much the same grounds. It was around that time that I got to know RealLife Connect, a young Viennese startup who’s co-founder Jürgen was running this Facebook page coined AustrianStartups. He started it as an open space for exchange among entrepreneurs and had grown it well into over a hundred followers. Back then he was leading the charge on expanding his business overseas and, while he didn’t have time to run it, he also didn’t want to let his side project fade away. So in a fit of youthful naiveté I rose to the challenge, got an admin role and started to play around with the community in a grassroots fashion. ? I started by connecting with other local up-and-coming communities like Pioneers and TEDxVienna, while posting startup relevant stories from and about founders. While the community and interaction within grew, I soon found others who shared the passion of bringing startupers together to learn from each other, and Can, Daniel, Adiam, Patrick and Christoph emerged as the most devoted partners I could’ve wished for ? Soon we hacked together the Start VIE interactive map on austrianstartups.com with the first searchable crowdsourced startup database for Austria and started hosting regular informal meetups we later called Stammtisch. AustrianStartups had quickly become more than a digital community. It was the common voice of a scene, a physical space of confluence and a repository of knowledge & ressources. ? Something that didn’t belong to anyone in particular, but to all simultaneously. A common good of sorts. So we formalized it as such, forming a non-partisan, non-profit initiative by, for, and of the Austrian startup community with the aim to increase its visibility and strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Once set into motion, AustrianStartups proved a force to be reckoned with: sporadic gatherings turned into regular monthly Stammtisch events, the crowdsourced database served as groundwork for mapping the whole Austrian startup ecosystem and aggregating & coordinating information set the foundation for publications such as Visions for Startups in Austria (2013), The Startup Agenda (2017) and The Austrian Startup Monitor (2018). As the startup environment in Austria changed over the last years, AustrianStartups did so as well, simultaneously influencing that transition and adjusting to it, to better cater for newly arising needs. Perhaps this is best reflected in the constant flux of talented and dedicated people ?<U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>?<U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> involved at all ranks – from volunteer helpers to operative management and finally to its board, which I have been a part of ever since signing the organization into existence. So I’ve been privileged enough to see a generational change and the extremely positive impact it could have on the evolution of the non-profit. With the very skilled Markus following in Christoph’s footsteps at the helm and visionary individuals like Maggie and Daniel enriching the board, I’ve witnessed first hand the transformational power of maintaining a constant influx of new people in all layers of AustrianStartups. Today, the vision of this organization is clearer than blue skies over Alpine slopes as it aims to make entrepreneurship as commonplace in Austria as skiing is. <U+26F7><U+FE0F> And while over the last 6 years I have left my mark on AustrianStartups as much as it has on me, the best way to support its current vision and assure its continued growth is to clear the path for the next generation. So I’m extremely proud to announce that I have found an incredibly talented, intelligent and motivated successor in fellow startup founder Katharina Unger, to whom I’m entrusting my board seat, effective immediately. But as I can’t really stop applying myself, I tend to stick around. Therefore I will be joining the AustrianStartups Advisory Board alongside many of the startup ecosystem elders, continuously supporting with bits of wisdom from the sidelines. Change is the only constant and talking about the future of the ecosystem is definitely a tense conversation (pun intended), but certainly also one that involves AustrianStartups. <U+2728> Vlad Gozman When I left Austria, there were two things that were quite definitely not on my list: founding a startup and coming back to Austria anytime soon. When I did end up founding a startup only 2 years later, in Hong Kong, Austria was still not on the map for me and my concerns couldn´t be more prejudiced against my own home country. “Notary public? Too much hassle” I thought. Some superficial research into the bureaucracy of raising grant fundings or setting up employee stock options confirmed my bias: we felt we had no time for an Austrian “between a melange and the spritzer kind of” pace of doing things. We had a few months between building an MVP, founding a company, raising funds, building a team and launching our first Kickstarter campaign. And we were convinced this was only possible in two places: the US and China. But then I had a change of mind: In 2016, on a trip back home, I stumbled into an AustrianStartups Stammtisch in Sektor5. Wait what? International vibes, energy, cool people – something good was going on here! AustrianStartups came across as young and spirited but also professional and trustworthy. I had known similar organizations on government level from Hong Kong or Singapore but an independent group standing in for national startup matters, represented not by the government but by the ecosystem itself is a truckload more power behind the wheel. I was impressed! Another 3 years later, I am humbled to be invited onto the board of this cool gang. Since our startup is, as of not too long ago, not only a Hong Kong but also an Austrian Startup, I am now sharing the mission with AustrianStartups to build a better ecosystem for everyone. And let me be clear: many of my prejudices in founding a startup in Austria later proved to be wrong or at least not as annoying or difficult as imagined in the first place. But we definitely have a lot more work ahead to make it accessible and easier for everyone! The topics where I hope to contribute value as a sparring partner in my time on the board are particularly: International Matters (particularly Asia) and Hardware. I have lived abroad for a long time (US+Asia) and still splitting my time between Asia and Europe. In our startup, we have bootstrapped our way from prototyping to manufacturing in Hong Kong and China. Of course, I am also happy to share my experiences as a female founder and public speaker. One of the topics close to my heart are the creative industries: as an industrial designer myself, I know how challenging it is as a creative professional to dare the jump to become larger than a one (wo-)man show. We could do better to help creatives to start-up and also make better use of creative skill sets in startups in general. The other topic is agritech/food startups: this sector is growing worldwide with more venture capital flowing into alternatives to meat, improvement of crops and digitalization in agriculture. Austria has a variety of landscapes and climates and a very open-minded and sustainability-oriented audience when it comes to food and agriculture. It therefore offers good prerequisites for prototyping and testing agtech. We have a lot to do. Wherever we can though, we should together use Austria´s benefits to inspire more diversity, more fearless super(wo-)man action and more optimism! Let´s do this, Austrian Startups ?

"https://austrianstartups.com/find-right-investor/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #46: How to find the RIGHT investor","Stammtisch #46 focused on the question, ‘How to find the RIGHT investor?’ because as it turns out, getting it wrong is easier than you might think. So here is what you should consider when looking for an investor. This time we were joined by Tobias Homberger CEO, myclubs, who as a lone founder guided his company through currently 4 rounds of investment and growth. Joined by Lisa-Marie Fassl managing director, Austrian Angel Investors Association (AAIA), a role which focuses on finding the right match between startup and investor. And finally, Oliver Holle founder and CEO, Speedinvest, bringing not just years of international experience to the discussion but a holistic approach having being on both sides of the bargaining table. Your first investment doesn’t need to be an investor. No, we’re not going to tell you to get in touch with family or friends – the infamous uncle’s investment – but you shouldn’t overlook government support. Make use of the big selection of public grants for startups – after all the state doesn’t take equity! Austria is one of the only governments to offer this – use it! Pitch your startup as much as you can. Building a network is how you will most likely find the right investor. Don’t take the money right away. Austria offers many opportunities to gain exposure before investment and it’s something the AAIA is looking for. There’s Pioneers, WeXelerate and Talent Garden. Going to these pitching events and contacting public grant institutions are good moves even if it is 6 months before you need investment. Getting the idea out there and stimulating interest is important. Avoid the less well known pitfall of incorrect share distribution. What is a red flag for investors? If at Seed Stage there are already clear problems with equity, often due to many non-operational shareholders, chances of further investment are slim if not impossible. Each investment builds on the previous one and the next investor will ask for more equity. The Startup will become non-fundable at some point as the return needed from equity will never be seen. In other words, don’t give 40% to a family member who lent you some office space for 3 months’ – it’s happened before. What not to look for in an investor. While a friendly and supportive investor might boost your confidence, it’s not going to help you when it comes to further developing your product. An investor shouldn’t be nice, they should be critical and challenge what you’re doing. Smart money vs dumb money Always consider what an investor can do for your startup besides the money. While some investors can provide you with a useful network or experience, others might cause internal problems like having an entirely different vision for your startup down the line. What social network is best to reach investors? In a nutshell – NONE, personal contact is important. If you want to contact investors, going on their actual website is one of the best ways to make the initial contact if you don’t have anybody in your network. The AAIA also promotes investors and their main function is to help with matching investors and startups – again their website is your best option. Don’t believe you made it just because you scored an angel investor. A common mistake. The first investment is really just the first battle. As investments increase more people will be interested and subsequently involved. Making sure that a return of over 100% on the initial investment can be achieved is hard work. Raising follow-on financing from initial investors, finding other investors to bring into the venture and maintaining quality and the brand are key. In summary: A good network is important when finding the right investor. Focus on building the network, getting exposure and understanding exactly what you need the investment for in the short term, investment is done in stages for a reason. See you at the next Stammtisch!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Optimized-579T1477-300x200.jpg","May 19th, 2017","en",0.993240475654602,4.16872935602441e-05,0.842571675777435,0.0022892071865499,0.155097514390945

Fifteen Seconds versteht sich als Plattform im Spannungsfeld zwischen Wirtschaft, Innovation und Kreativität und veranstaltet neben einem jährlichen Festival auch seine eigene Youtube Show, produziert Podcasts und bietet innovative Workshops und Retreats für Einzelpersonen und Unternehmen an. „Bei uns ist jeder willkommen, der die Welt verbessern möchte“, sagt Stefan, egal ob beruflich, persönlich oder gesellschaftlich. Und die Betonung liegt auf jeder, denn Fifteen Seconds zeigt sich stolz als interdisziplinäres Format. Leidenschaft und Neugierde der Teilnehmer:innen seien das, was im Vordergrund steht; nicht Alter, Berufswahl oder Aussehen. Fifteen Seconds‘ Veranstaltungen sind daher von Natur aus inklusiv gestaltet und dennoch von einem gewissen Hauch an Exklusivität geprägt, der schwer nachzuahmen ist. „Wir haben ja de facto nicht das Rad erfunden, wir haben es nur neu designed“ – mit einer unglaublichen Liebe zum Detail soll Fifteen Seconds Erlebnisse schaffen, die es Besucher:innen ermöglichen abzuschalten, in neue Welten einzutauchen und sich inspirieren zu lassen. Graz > Wien Der Erfolg dieses Konzeptes ist für Stefan etwas, das sich Co-Founder Thiemo und er hart erkämpfen mussten, aber auch etwas das überwiegend auf die Authentizität und die Leidenschaft zurückzuführen ist, die das gesamte Team an den Tag legt. Es sei v.a. wichtig sich selbst treu zu bleiben, sein Ding durchzuziehen und die eigene Persönlichkeit in das was man tut mit einzubringen. Daher bleibt Graz auch weiterhin Hauptbühne des Fifteen Seconds Festivals und darum ruft Stefan auch mal hunderte Gäste persönlich an, wenn es um Pandemie-bedingte Ticketrückerstattungen geht. Und dann kam COVID Gerade als das Unternehmen drauf und dran war sein wirtschaftlich erfolgreichstes Geschäftsjahr hinzulegen, begann unglücklicherweise eine mysteriöse Lungenkrankheit aus Wuhan die ganze Welt heimzusuchen. Für Stefan und sein Team war daher recht schnell klar, dass ihre Events im Jahr 2020 nicht mehr stattfinden könnten. Für ein aufstrebendes Unternehmen ein absolutes Horrorszenario. Und dennoch, trotz aller Belastungen des vergangenen Jahres, kommt man beim Zuhören nicht umhin, Stefans lösungsorientierte, machen-statt-jammern Einstellung zu bemerken: „Für mich hat am Ende des Tages, wenn man das sagen darf, COVID, unter Anführungszeichen, auch etwas Positives gehabt. Wenn man anfängt Dinge  zu hinterfragen und grundsätzlich ein positiver und leidenschaftlicher und arbeitswilliger Mensch ist, dann kann man ja aus den schlimmsten Situationen heraus auch wahnsinnig Positives spinnen und ein Unternehmen weiterentwickeln.“ Bis uns schlechte Internetverbindungen nicht mehr scheiden Zeitgemäße Events zu veranstalten, bedeute für den Augenblick die aufzubrechen und an unterschiedlichen Locations (bestmöglich Openair) stattfinden zu lassen. Für die Zukunft aber sagt Stefan voraus, dass wir durchaus wieder zu physischen Veranstaltungen zurückkehren werden – bestimmte Dinge könne man einfach nicht über Webcams vermitteln. Trotzdem werde auch ein gewisser Anteil unserer digitalen Ansätze erhalten bleiben, v.a. wenn es darum geht vermehrt auf Nachhaltigkeit zu setzen. „Ich versuche mit Fifteen Seconds und auch privat und mit der Familie , dass sich die Welt ein Stück weit in ihrem gesellschaftlichen Miteinander wieder zu einem besseren Ort entwickelt. Zu einem Ort, in dem man sich wieder mehr wertschätzt, in dem man respektvoller miteinander umgeht, in dem Wirtschaft wieder ein Stück weit nach hinten rückt und die Personen in den Vordergrund rücken. Und man sich mehr über Dinge Gedanken macht  die dann auch den Generationen nach uns  eine gute Welt ermöglicht.“ Autorin: Lena Silberbauer","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/future_weekly-300x164.png","April 29th, 2021","de",0.998781323432922,6.28617490292527e-05,0.969374895095825,0.000117971823783591,0.0304442755877972

Wie wir allerdings aus der letzten Podcastfolge und dem Durchforsten der Standard Kommentare nach dem „Keyboard Warrior of the Week“ wissen, ist vielen in der Allgemeinbevölkerung aber noch nicht ganz klar, was der Begriff Startup genau bedeutet und was ein Job in diesem Feld überhaupt mit sich bringt. Wir seien aber auf dem besten Weg, meint Gabi: „Ziel wäre natürlich, dass wir uns überflüssig machen , aber solang das nicht der Fall ist können wir gemeinsam noch daran arbeiten.“ Vienna Calling Und das tut die Wirtschaftsagentur Wien, indem sie das nationale Bewusstsein für Startups und den internationalen Bekanntheitsgrad Wiens als Startup Hub zu fördert. Gabi beschreibt unsere Hauptstadt als einen „Hidden Champion“ bzw. „Rising Star“ unter den Starting Up Standorten. Das Startup Ökosystem in Österreich wachse und gedeihe immer weiter, auch weil Wien viele attraktive Rahmenbindungen vorweisen könne: einen hohen Professionalisierungsgrad zum Beispiel, sowie sprachliches, kulturelles und v.a. leistbares Knowhow und insbesondere auch eine ausgezeichnete Lebensqualität. Das Einzige, das Wien damit noch fehlt wäre ein Sandstrand, aber auch hier stellt Gabis Meinung nach die Donauinsel eine würdige Alternative dar. Klingt ziemlich idyllisch, oder? Nun, natürlich weiß auch unser Podcast Gast, dass es durchaus noch Bereiche gibt, wo man Verbesserungen vorantreiben müsse – allen voran die in Österreich und Europa relativ überschaubare Finanzierungslandschaft. Zusätzlich stünde auch die gute alte Bürokratie im Inland Startups immer wieder im Weg, speziell wenn es um die österreichische Rechtsform, Arbeitsbewilligungen für Drittstaatsangehörige und Möglichkeiten zur Mitarbeiterbeteiligung geht. Digitaler Humanismus Nichtsdestotrotz glaubt Gabi fest an das Potenzial Wiens als Lebensraum und als Wirtschaftsstandort. Von Smart City, Green Tech und Life Science, bis hin zur Kreativwirtschaft beherbergt die Bundeshauptstadt ein sehr breites Spektrum an Themenbereichen und Branchen. Gabi fasst diese unter dem Begriff „Digitaler Humanismus“ zusammen, denn der Mensch und die Umwelt stünden immer mehr im Fokus zahlreicher in Österreich gegründeter Startups. Die dahingehende Diversität unseres Standortes betrachtet Gabi als einen Vorteil. Die Vergangenheit habe bereits gezeigt, dass Wien eine Stadt ist, in der verrückte Ideen aus allen möglichen Bereichen zu etwas Großartigem heranwachsen können. Es gelte aber Menschen verstärkt auf innovative Projekte aufmerksam zu machen und Vorbildfunktion zu schaffen: „Eigentlich müsste man alle Straßen der Stadt Wien tapezieren mit diesen tollen Ideen, was die Unternehmer da alles auf den Boden bringen und sich neues einfallen lassen“. Crazy to Grand – ViennaUP‘21 Einen ersten Einblick in die Vielfalt der Ideen und Startups, die Österreich und Wien zu bieten haben, möchten Gabi und die Wirtschaftsagentur durch die ViennaUP’21 bereitstellen. Der Online Startup Gipfel soll dabei mit mehr als 40 Programmpartner:innen und unterschiedlichsten Veranstaltungsformaten sowohl Teilnehmende aus dem In- und Ausland, wie auch Studierende bis hin zu Investoren ansprechen, abholen und für Wien als Startup Hub begeistern. Das Festival soll aber auch Startups selbst eine Plattform bieten, um gegenseitigen Austausch zu ermöglichen und Synergieeffekte zu schaffen. Was bringt die Zukunft? Gabi sieht der Zukunft Wiens als Startup Hotspot positiv entgegen. Über die Coronakrise hinweg habe sie bereits gebannt beobachtet, mit welcher Agilität und Kreativität Startups sich mit der Pandemie auseinandergesetzt, sich neu aufgestellt und sogar neue Geschäftsmodelle für sich entwickelt haben. Zukünftig sei es darüber hinaus besonders wichtig, nachhaltige und soziale Fragen schon von Anfang an bei der Unternehmensgründung zu berücksichtigen: „Gegen COVID können wir uns impfen lassen, gegen den Klimawandel nicht“. Für die Zukunft wünscht sich Gabi daher ein smartes, nachhaltiges, CO2-freies Wien – ein schöner Moonshot, wie auch Daniel und Markus finden, und wohlgemerkt sogar realistisch.

"https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-90-deep-dive-hypergrowth-mit-felix-ohswald/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly #90 | Deep Dive: Hypergrowth mit Felix Ohswald","Founder of GoStudent – We are hiring! Mitgründer und CEO von GoStudent, Felix Ohswald, hat schon früh sein unternehmerisches Talent entdeckt. Als etwa 10-Jähriger habe er zum Beispiel begonnen, ausgeborgte DVDs zu brennen und weiterzuverkaufen, um sich damit seine Hobbies zu finanzieren. Mittlerweile stellt Felix keine illegalen Raubkopien mehr her, aber die Entrepreneurship-Ader zieht sich dennoch wie ein roter Faden durch seinen bisherigen Werdegang: „Ich hatte immer irgendwie den Drang, ok ich möcht‘ so Market Opportunitäten, die sich ergeben, die möchte ich ausnutzen und einen Mehrwert daraus schlagen“. Das jüngste Beispiel seiner Projekte ist das 2016 gegründete Ed-Tech Startup GoStudent, mit dem er und Co-Founder Gregor nun den europäischen Bildungsbereich zu revolutionieren versuchen. Zeugnistag Müsste Felix dem heutigen Schulsystem ein Zeugnis ausstellen, würde die Art und Weise wie Unterricht abgehalten wird nicht immer die Bestnote verdienen. Eine gute Lehrperson sei jemand der Begeisterung für sein Fach mitbringe, jemand der inspirieren könne aber gleichzeitig auch pädagogische Fähigkeiten besitze. Diese Lehrer:innen gäbe zwar es da draußen, nur leider hat nicht jedes der rund 70 Millionen Schulkinder in Europa unmittelbaren Zugang zu diesen. Genau das will GoStudent ändern indem es einen digitalen Service anbietet, der erstklassige Tutor:innen mit Schüler:innen zusammenbringt. Österreichs schnellst-wachsendes Startup Mittlerweile ist Felix’ Ed-Tech Startup in mehr als 10 Ländern in ganz Europa aktiv. Aber um das Ziel eine globale Schule zu schaffen auch tatsächlich umzusetzen, braucht es in einem Operations-lastigen Unternehmen wie GoStudent auch die nötige Manpower. Allein im letzten Jahr rekrutierte Felix‘ Team 400+ Mitarbeiter:innen and counting, denn GoStudents Belegschaft wächst weiter rasant. Ein derartiges Hyperwachstum stellt eine besonders kritische Phase für jedes Unternehmen dar, nicht zuletzt, weil es mehr als nur talentierte Mitarbeiter:innen braucht, um erfolgreich zu sein. Hypergrowth sei in diesem Sinne ein bisschen wie Leistungssport, meint Felix. Einerseits sei es Kopfsache – man müsse als Mitarbeiter:in das Mindset und die Werte des Unternehmens teilen, sowie die erforderliche Motivation mitbringen, andererseits müsse man auch bereit sein, die nötige Arbeit zu leisten, um sich gemeinsam im Rennen um Platz 1 durchzukämpfen. Eine derartige Arbeitskultur, sei natürlich nicht für jede:n etwas und um genau jene Mitarbeiter:innen zu finden, die die Mission des Unternehmens mittragen und leben, brauche es v.a. Geduld: “ durch dieses schnelle Wachstum, wachsen deine Strukturen einfach nicht so schnell mit. Selbst wenn du eine Finanzierungsrunde aufstellt und jetzt 200 Millionen mehr am Firmenkonto hast, das heißt nicht, dass du zehnmal so schnell gute Leute findest. Gute Leute zu finden, generell Mitarbeiter im Unternehmen zu finden, die da mit anpacken wollen, die auch den Drive, die Energie haben – dieses Problem wird nicht durch Geld gelöst.“ Eine der wichtigsten Erkenntnisse aus dem vergangen Jahr ist für Felix daher, dass ein starkes Anfangs- und Managementteam aufzustellen der Schlüsselfaktor in jeder Expansion ist. Denn die ersten fünf Mitarbeiter:innen beeinflussen das Mindset der nächsten 50 und so fort. Was man dabei unterschätze sei allerdings, wie viel zurückhaltender und vorsichtiger man selbst werde, je größer das Unternehmen und je höher der Einsatz wird. Hier mutig zu bleiben und weiterhin eine gewisse Risikobereitschaft zu zeigen, sei enorm wichtig aber auch ein Lernprozess von dem selbst Felix und sein krisensicheres Team nicht gefeit sind. Den Mount Everest erklimmen 2020 hat GoStudent seine Mitarbeiterschaft mehr als verzehnfacht, in fünf Jahren soll GoStudent dann eine Plattform sein an der kein Elternteil, Schüler:in oder Leher.in mehr vorbeikommt. Um bei der Analogie des Leistungssportes zu bleiben: „Der Bildungsbereich ist definitiv ein  Mount Everest oder K2 Gipfel, weil es ist so fragmentiert, es gibt so viele verschiedene Player,  jeder von uns hat Bildung in irgendeiner Form erlebt  jeder hat in irgendeiner Form eine persönliche Erfahrung, was natürlich dann auch den Effekt hat – jeder hat eine Meinung dazu – und bei Bildung hat jeder eine sehr starke Meinung.“ All diese unterschiedlichen Stakeholder und Ansichten auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu bringen, sei dabei natürlich eine Herausforderung. Am Ende des Tages möchte man aber einen Mehrwert schaffen und Familien einen Service bieten, der jedem/jeder Schüler:in dabei hilft ihr volles Potenzial zu erreichen.

"https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-blockchain-nfts-crypto-mit-jurgen-hobarth/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly | Blockchain, NFTs & Crypto mit Jürgen Höbarth","One Man Company Builder mit verschiedenen Netzwerken „Mich hat einfach immer Technik fasziniert.  Für mich war das so faszinierend – du sitzt in Oberösterreich und du kannst eine Website aufmachen in Australien. Jetzt ist das für jeden komplett normal.“, berichtet Jürgen mit oberösterreichischem Dialekt-Einschlag über Webcam aus Hongkong. Von dort aus arbeitet er nun in seinen eigenen Worten als „One Man Company Builder mit verschiedenen Netzwerken“ und fokussiert sich dabei v.a. auf Blockchain Technologie, Crypto Currencies und Tokenisierung. Im Gespräch kommt heraus, dass Jürgen schon immer jemand war, der technologische Trends früh erkannt hat – eine Art technologisches Frühwarnsystem sozusagen. Auf die Frage hin, wie er denn seine Ideen generiert, antwortet er unverblümt es sei nicht anders als bei einem herkömmlichen Analysten in der Finanzwelt: Man analysiert wie Dinge ablaufen und bildet sich eine Meinung darüber. Dazu sei es aber auch wichtig den Medienclutter unserer Zeit zur Seite zu schieben und seinem eigenen Instinkt zu folgen – wenn wir doch alle Jürgen Höbarth’s Instinkt hätten. “Wat isn jetz Crypto Oma?” Dieser Instinkt ist es auch, der Jürgens Interesse an Krypto schon geweckt hat, als diese noch in den Kinderschuhen steckte. „Was E-Mail zur traditionellen Post ist, [sind] Crypto Currencies zur traditionellen Geldwirtschaft“, erklärt uns Jürgen in einem Satz. Damit könne man derzeit online bezahlen und v.a. auch spekulieren. Spekulieren sei hier allerdings das Stichwort, denn investieren und spekulieren würden in diesem Kontext häufig verwechselt. Ob man heute noch in Bitcoin investieren sollte? Wenn man Jürgen um seine professionelle Meinung bittet, sei das eine Frage die sich jede_r selbst stellen muss. Was für traditionelle Investitionsmethoden gilt, gelte auch für Bitcoin und Co.: Vorerst sollte man ein allgemeines Verständnis für die Grundlagen des Finanzwesens aufbauen und für sich persönlich entscheiden, ob man es finanziell verkraften könne auch Geld dabei zu verlieren. Wenn man denkt, man könne einmal in Krypto investieren und danach sofort seinen Job kündigen und einen Sportwagen kaufen, liege man falsch, meint Jürgen. Pumpamental vs. Fundamental Wichtig sei auch Bitcoin derzeit als ein eher langfristiges Investment zu betrachten und die Kryptowährungen zugrundeliegende Kultur verstehen zu lernen. Diese könne nämlich durch unterschiedlichste (Hype-)Faktoren stark beeinflusst werden – daher auch die Unterscheidung zwischen sogenannten „Fundamental“ und „Pumpamental“ Coins. Ein Beispiel zur Erklärung: „Kim Kardashian macht einen Fonds auf für Crypto. Ich bin mir sicher die kann eine Milliarde raisen, weil würd man investieren wenn Kim Kardashian eine Coin macht? Klar, weil da sind Pumpamentals da“ und diese erzeugen eine gewisse Aufmerksamkeit, einen gewissen Hype und dadurch auch den Reiz darin Geld anzulegen. „Wenn die ZIB über etwas berichtet, dann ist es da“ Ein Hype, über den in den letzten Wochen sogar in gängigen österreichischen Medien berichtet wurde, ist jener um NFTs – non fungible tokens. Diese, meint Jürgen, könne man sich als eine Art Container vorstellen, in den man verschiedene Dinge hineinpacken kann. So könnte theoretisch von einer Wohnung bis zu einem Turnschuh alles digital durch ein NFT repräsentiert werden. Klingt komplex? Ist es auch. Aber wenn es nach Jürgen geht werden NFTs in einigen Jahren sogar noch weiter verbreitet sein als Crypto Currencies selbst. To the moon? Letztlich ist das, was wir bisher von NFTs, Krypto und ihren Begleitern gesehen haben aber nur ein kleiner Teil des unvorstellbaren Zukunftspotenzials einer Technologie, die von vielen Verfechter_innen auch als Katalysator eines größeren, systemischen Wandels unserer Gesellschaft betrachtet wird. „Technologie soll Dinge vereinfachen und Dinge optimieren. Ich brauch jetzt nicht für jede Standard Transaktion von einer Wohnung einen Rechtsanwalt und für jede GesmbH Eröffnung muss dieser und jener unterschreiben“, das könne man durchaus effizienter gestalten, stimmt Jürgen dem Thema bei. Dennoch glaubt er nicht daran, dass eine vollständige Dezentralisierung unserer Systeme tatsächlich möglich sein könnte. Am Ende denkt er, wird eine Kombination aus Neuem und Bestehendem gefunden werden.

"https://austrianstartups.com/future-weekly-die-zukunft-von-osterreich-mit-hansi-hansmann/","AustrianStartups","Future Weekly | Die Zukunft von Österreich mit Hansi Hansmann","Serial Entrepreneur & Business Angel – CURRENTLY NOT INVESTING Hansi Hansmann ist wohl jedem in der österreichischen Startup-Szene ein Begriff. Während ihn seine Linkedin Bio als Serial Entrepreneur und Business Angel ausweist; beschreibt Hansi sich selbst als jemand, der sich leidenschaftlich gerne mit innovativen Ideen beschäftigt und v.a. das tut was ihm Spaß macht. Nämlich mit jungen, energiegeladenen Unternehmer_innen zusammenzuarbeiten, das Potenzial in ihren kreativen Geschäftsideen zu erkennen und diese mit seiner Expertise und Erfahrung zu unterstützen. Im Laufe der Jahre hat Hansi, so eine Vielzahl von Startups auf ihrem Weg zum Erfolg begleitet. Runtastic, mySugr, und shpock sind nur ein paar Beispiele aus dem breitgefächerten Portfolio seiner Hansmengroup. Das Hansi Hansmann Erfolgsrezept Auf die Frage, welche Faktoren für ihn bei einer Investitionsentscheidung unabdingbar seien, wird deutlich, dass Hansi sich bei einem Großteil seiner Investments v.a. von seiner Menschenkenntnis leiten lässt. Eine genaue Anleitung, wie man das perfekte Tech-Startup-Rezept selbst zuhause zubereiten kann, findet sich im Anhang, aber soviel sei gesagt – mit einer guten Idee allein ist es nicht getan. Hansi investiert in Teams: „Eine grandiose Idee  mit einem durchschnittlich guten Team hat immer schlechtere Chancen, als ein nicht so gutes Projekt mit einem exzellenten Team.“ Gegenseitige Sympathie spiele dabei ebenfalls eine fundamentale Rolle. Jedes Startup gehe früher oder später durch seine Krisen, meint Hansi. Diese aber gemeinsam zu bewältigen, mit einem Team, das sich gegenseitig unterstützt und sich in seinen Eigenschaften und Fähigkeiten ergänzt, sei letztendlich was ein erfolgreiches Projekt ausmacht. Die Lage der Nation Doch das Funkeln, das in Hansis Augen leuchtet, während er über seine bisherigen Unternehmungen spricht, verblasst recht schnell als die gesellschaftliche Haltung Österreichs zur Startup-Szene zum Thema wird. Grausam ist das Wort, das Hansi hier direkt über die Lippen kommt: „Die Ösi-Mentalität  ist weder unternehmerfreundlich und schon gar nicht Startup-freundlich“. Österreicher_innen seien dem Unternehmertum gegenüber grundsätzlich negativ eingestellt und nicht ausreichend risikoaffin. Beides sind Faktoren, die sich besonders nachteilig auf Startups auswirken. The way out Das unternehmerische Armutszeugnis, das Hansi unserer Alpennation somit ausstellt, könne allerdings v.a. durch Bildung verbessert werden. Diese müsse wirksamer auf die digitale Welt vorbereiten und zudem unternehmerisches Denken bereits im frühen Kindealter spielerisch fördern. Auch eine potente Imagekampagne der Regierung sieht Hansi als zielführende Maßnahme, um das Bild des Unternehmertums in Österreich nachhaltig positiver zu besetzen. Daniel und Markus jubilieren stumm. „Es sollte nicht sein, dass nur einzelne Unternehmerpersönlichkeiten – die es immer geben wird, überall – erfolgreich sind und sich trotz aller Widrigkeiten durchsetzen können. Es sollte so sein, dass die Grundlagen des Systems so sind, dass möglichst viele Unternehmer dabei rauskommen und die Anzahl der erfolgreichen Unternehmerpersönlichkeiten da natürlich eine unendlich viel Größere ist “ , meint Hansi. Soweit hätte Österreich es allerdings versäumt, derartige Grundlagen zu schaffen. Apropos Versäumnisse Wenn wir schon beim Thema Versäumnisse sind, sprechen wir doch auch gleich über das Corona-Management der österreichischen Bundesregierung. Obwohl es generell natürlich schwer sei als Politiker_in in einer Pandemie etwas richtig zu machen, kann auch Hansi nicht leugnen, dass Österreich an vielen Fronten auch Besseres hätte leisten können. „Was ich bis heute nicht verstehe ist, dass wir eigentlich technologisch, digital in der Lage wären Covid ganz exzellent, vollkommen unter Kontrolle zu haben. Wir haben alle Möglichkeiten  und wir tun‘s nicht.“ Standortmarketing, Standortmarketing, Standortmarketing In der Innovation liegt für Hansi Österreichs und Europas letzte Chance, auf der Weltbühne nicht in komplette, wirtschaftliche Bedeutungslosigkeit abzudriften und den Vorsprung, den sich Länder wie Israel durch die rasche Durchimpfung ihrer Bevölkerung verschafft haben aufzuholen. Europa biete durch seine reiche historische Tradition und seinen Multikulturalismus einen einzigartigen Nährboden für Kreativität. Diese Vorzüge gelte es zu nutzen, entsprechend zu vermarkten und sich aktiv in Bereichen zu positionieren, die andere noch nicht eingenommen haben. Insbesondere Gender Diversity sei Hansis Meinung nach ein Anziehungsfaktor, mit dem Wien als Wirtschaftsstandort wirklich glänzen könnte. Aber auch die Klimakrise sei und bleibe ein globales Thema, das Österreich weiterhin zum Anlass nehmen könne, um in Sachen Innovation Stellung zu beziehen. Wind of Change Aber wie in vielen anderen Fällen stünde Österreich sich auch hier selbst im Weg. Neben der bereits angesprochenen Risikoaversion, zählt auch ein gewisses Maß an Veränderungsresistenz zu den prägenden Eigenschaften der, in Hansis Worten, „grausamen“ Ösi-Mentalität. Als bestes Beispiel ließe sich die Wintersportindustrie nennen, wo schon lange ein Umdenken hätte passieren müssen, anstatt veraltete Geschäftsmodelle bis zum letzten Tropfen auszumelken. Ja, Veränderung tue weh, aber Veränderung sei letztendlich unumgänglich und je früher man sich darauf einstelle und Raum für Innovation und Fortschritt schaffe, umso eher könne man diese Veränderung noch selbst mitgestalten. Erneut sei hier auch die Politik gefordert, zukunftsorientiert statt wahlkampffokussiert und europäisch statt national zu denken: „Das ist die einzige Lösung. Wir müssen alle mehr wie Europäer denken und an ganz Europa denken, wenn schon nicht an die ganze Welt.  Nur so können wir langfristig  unseren Wohlstand, den es nun einmal in Europa gibt, halbwegs bewahren oder halbwegs aufrechterhalten.“ Anhang: Das Hansi Hansmann Erfolgsrezept für TechStartups (Schwierigkeitsgrad: mittel bis schwer) Erster Schritt: Legen Sie den Boden der Backform zunächst mit einer guten Idee aus. Oft wurzelt diese in der Bewältigung eines Problems, mit dem die Gründer_innen selbst oder ihnen nahestehende Personen konfrontiert sind. Zweiter Schritt: Fügen Sie 2-4 Gründungsmitglieder hinzu. Eines allein reicht oft nicht aus, um das Projekt aufgehen zu lassen, während 5 oder mehr den Brei meist versalzen. Verwenden Sie in diesem Schritt nur erstklassige, hochwertige Zutaten: – eines der Teammitglieder sollte die Führungsposition einnehmen und das Produkt leben – eines sollte die Technologie hinter der Idee beherrschen – eines sollte extrovertiert sein und die Idee verkaufen können – eines sollte die bedeutendsten KPIs auch im Schlaf abrufen können Achtung: Seien Sie nicht verunsichert, in manchen Fällen können zwei dieser Schlüsselfaktoren auch in einer Person vereint sein. Dritter Schritt: Gut durchmischen. Achten Sie allerdings beim Mixen darauf, dass sich alle Rollen gleichmäßig verteilen. Vierter Schritt: Streuen Sie etwas gegenseitige Sympathie obendrauf bevor Sie investieren und das Projekt bei mittlerer bis hoher Hitze 5-10 Jahre backen. É voila!

"https://austrianstartups.com/guest-post-success-factors-among-startups-in-austria/","AustrianStartups","Guest Post: Success Factors among Startups in Austria","Learning 1: Industry and Business Model are Key The industry a startup operates in, and the business model it employs, are closely correlated with a startup’s success – whether measured in turnover, valuations or the amount of funding it obtains. For valuations, for instance, the industry a startup operates in represents the very most important predictor for its valuation, followed by its age and business model. Figure 1 shows the features ranked by their importance for valuations for a Random Forest Model after training. Figure 1: Feature Importance for Valuations The boxplots of Figure 2 compare the turnover of startups between different industries, with the aim of demonstrating the impact and differences between industries. The green triangle marks the turnover means. It is important to mention that the horizontal axis states turnover in categories from 0 to 9 – which should be interpreted similarly to a logistic scale: for instance, the difference between categories 8 and 9 is magnitudes larger than the difference between categories 1 and 2. [2] Nevertheless, it is clear that the industries of FinTech, Software Development and Electronics are among the most lucrative ones for startups in Austria.Figure 2: Comparing startups’ Turnover in different Industries For business models, in general the data suggests that the more digital and scalable they are , the higher is the likelihood of a startup to perform well. These findings were further confirmed by flexible working hours being significantly and positively related to higher valuations. While it is unlikely that flexible working hours per se are of so much impact, they represent a good indicator on how digital a startup’s industry and business model are: for instance, in manufacturing or gastronomy, flexible working hours are much more difficult to offer than in software development. Learning 2: Social startups focus on less lucrative and scalable Business Models and Industries When simply comparing profit-driven startups, and ones primarily following social or ecological targets, based on their average turnover, valuations or funding amounts, social startups seem to face great disadvantages. However, drilling down deeper through the data, it becomes clear that social startups systematically are founded in less lucrative industries, and with less scalable business models – which is, to be fair, quite logical. For instance, industries like food or clothing provide more obvious opportunities for social improvement than FinTech or IT. Figure 3 shows their differing distribution among industries compared to profit driven startups (white-ish the profit driven ones, and the social startups in blue). For example, one may note that not a single social startup that responded to the survey operated in the very lucrative FinTech industry. This phenomenon explains the largest part of disadvantage they face on average compared to profit-driven startups. However, one must keep in mind that the sample employed for analysis was collected in March and April 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that social startups are hit much harder than their more digitalized profit-driven counterparts. For this reason, I believe that policy makers should support social startups especially well in order for them to survive the current crisis. Figure 3: The Distribution of startups among Industries One factor that was found to be negatively correlated with startup valuations was employee participation in the startup’s decision making processes. Such participation may conflict with and compromise a clear focus on profit maximization, which might make such startups less attractive investment cases. Social startups could be more inclined to offer such participation to their employees, in turn hurting their valuations. Learning 3: Cooperation with larger Corporations pays off After controlling for other factors, cooperations only with large corporations were still found to have significant positive effects on a startup’s turnover. This was not the case for cooperation with SME’s, universities, or other public institutions. One explanation may be that startups benefit significantly from their larger partners’ scale, established business relations and vast resources. Similarly, spin-offs from large companies experience benefits in turnover compared to independently founded startups, and other spin-offs. Learning 4: A high Share of internal R&D benefits Sales Moreover, the analysis showed clearly that startups‘ turnover benefits from a high percentage of product development performed internally. Outsourcing such a core value chain activity seems to hurt sales growth. One possible explanation may be the ability to tailor solutions closer to customer needs when developing products in-house. This is a finding that should also be of importance not only for startups, but may apply to all kinds of companies. Further, there exists a weak correlation between employee cash bonuses and sales performance. However, this correlation was not significant. Learning 5: Startups founded in Teams have easier Access to Funding Notably, the amounts of funding and the valuations the average solo-founder obtains for his startup are significantly lower than for comparable startups founded by a team of entrepreneurs. This may stem from the wide anticipation of founding teams’ better performance among professionals and venture capitalists – which makes sense, since a team can deliver a wider range of complementary skills, more manpower, a more extensive professional network, and additional points of view towards a venture. However, within academia, whether teams actually perform better than solo entrepreneurs is heavily disputed, and evidence is inconclusive. Also, in the study at hand, there was no superior performance found for teams regarding turnover. After all, it may well be that solo founders have a harder time securing funding because venture capitalists are negatively biased towards them. Another factor shown to have significant positive impact on funding amounts represent patents, which may result from their employment in the valuation process, or as an indicator for public sources of funding. Methodology and Limitations The analysis upon which this article is based was performed for a master thesis (“Quantitative Analysis of Startups’ Success Factors in Austria”). The data upon which this analysis is built was collected in the course of the ASM Survey 2018. The total sample size was 368 responses – which in turn varied slightly depending on data cleaning for the respective success indicators (turnover, valuations or external capital received. As such, the results presented are prone to all kinds of limitations stemming from survey data, such as self-selection and biased answers. In order to conduct analysis on the success factors of turnover, valuations and external capital received, survey data – which had originally been collected in nominal ranges of varying sizes – was transformed to ordinal categories from 0 to 9. This resulted not only in a loss of information, but also made analysis more complicated, as the data analysis task may be tackled both as a regression and classification problem. Analysis was conducted through meaningful data visualisation and interpretation, correlation analysis, t-tests and f-tests, Random Forest Analysis, and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). If you are interested in more details, or in the whole master thesis upon which the article at hand is based, you are welcome to reach out to philipp.schardax@austrianstartups.com . The data upon which the following analysis is built was collected in conjuncture by AustrianStartup, the Center of Entrepreneurship by Vienna’s University of Economics and Business, and Austria’s largest research organization, the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). We highly acknowledge all these organizations’ efforts and expertise in collecting the data. [1] Put simply, Random Forest algorithms work by building a large number of decision trees and merge them, in order to produce a more accurate prediction. As such, they are very versatile regarding training data, and interpretation can be performed by plotting the importance of the variables analysed.

"https://austrianstartups.com/internationalisation-of-startups/","AustrianStartups","Key challenges to going abroad – Internationalisation of startups","The concept of the “liability of foreignness” is well known in international business and it is no less of a hurdle for startups as it is for multinational corporations. It refers to the problems faced by firms trying to overcome the difficulties of expanding abroad. The term encompasses the problem faced by foreign companies in competition with local existing firms and ranges from obvious challenges like having to export physical goods over a longer distance as well cultural barriers. From the beginning, all startups dream of global success with their products or services being consumed or utilised with disregard for national borders. For startups in smaller countries like Austria the greater revenue opportunities and potential for more impact makes international success an enticing aim. Europe-wide, more than half of all startups generate some form of revenue abroad. For countries like Finland and Hungary this is very high whereas for countries like Germany with a large domestic market, the share of startups focused on foreign markets is lower. At 51 percent of startups generating revenue abroad, Austria sits slightly below the European Startup Monitor average of 55 percent and is the European country with lowest proportion of revenues made in Non-EU countries. Despite this, Austrian startups represent the highest share generating revenues in fellow European countries. “Austria is the European country with lowest proportion of revenues made in Non-EU countries”. Austria’s position in Central Europe and small domestic size mean that the potential for early stage internationalisation is high, however, it is not easy. Looking at the most recent European Start-up Monitor from 2016, we will look at the main challenges that startups face when it comes to internationalising. Differences in legislation and regulations Around one third of European startups claimed that the biggest problem they had was the differing legislations and regulations. This is a challenge that imposes additional costs on startups and makes exporting to companies with a greater regulatory gap, like those outside of the EU very difficult. This alongside the economy of distance explains why revenue generated worldwide is much lower than in fellow European countries. Thus, it goes without saying, any successful internationalisation strategy needs to take into consideration at an early stage the regulatory differences in different markets. This is especially the case for companies that require, licenses or regulatory approval like in fintech or health. Differing taxation systems should also be taken into consideration as they increase the operational costs imposed by internationalisation. “Around one third of European startups claimed that the biggest problem they had was the differing legislations and regulations.” Adapting services and products to foreign market If a startup has been successful in their domestic market they can rely on a strong brand reputation and a good understanding of the market’s needs and expectations. However, there is no one-size-fits-all formula which addresses the local needs. Startups must have a good understanding of what consumers or clients require and what incumbent firms are doing. If anything, this challenge acts as a warning against entering new market too quickly or underestimating the challenges that come with it. Despite this, technology services that offer non-tangible goods and a naturally ‘born global’ product like Vienna based travel website, TourRadar, or language learning apps like busuu (founded by Austrian Bernhard Niesner) are often better aimed at an international audience from the outset. Cultural differences Although cultural difference relates to the point raised above, it is also important to consider how culture in itself represents a major challenge for a startup trying to expand outside of the comfort zone of its own market. To be successful, a startup will often have to provide services in the local language as well as avoid offence by breaking cultural faux pas. It goes without saying that a craft beer manufacturer would be best advised not to look for distributors in Saudi Arabia. However, sometimes these differences can be more subtle and impact the operational side of things. This is especially the case in business-to-business relationships where different corporate cultures make it difficult for start-ups to access decision makers. Differences of culture therefore must be considered in strategic considerations whereby acquiring local human capital, working with foreign partners and even setting up a subsidiary are all options to help to overcome the “liability of foreignness”. Internationalisation is both enticing and difficult. It requires a combination of trial and error as well as an international strategy. Whatever happens, startups must choose their markets carefully and plan ahead. If success at home is difficult, success abroad may represent more of a challenge for some startups, whilst it may even be easier than at home for others – it all depends on your product and finding the right market for it. – Written by Samuel Hargreaves – This represents the start of a series of blogs into the internationalisation of startups looking at the challenges and success stories of Austrian companies. The next blog article will be focusing on regulatory barriers and in particular the difficulties faced by fintechs.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180611_015458-e1543494413577-300x300.jpg","September 13th, 2018","en",0.996883928775787,0.235769141465425,0.67597721517086,0.0350330993533134,0.0532205253839493
"https://austrianstartups.com/israel-the-startup-nation/","AustrianStartups","Israel – The Startup Nation","Formerly known for Oranges and Kibbutzim, Israel has long morphed into a global hotspot for innovation. Given its geopolitical situation, no natural resources and a lack of water, one is left to wonder how this young and small country in the Middle East has managed to become one of the most innovative nations of the world with Tel Aviv being among the world’s most acclaimed startup clusters. Israel’s Silicon Wadi (Wadi: Arabic for Valley) – i.e. the metropolitan area around Tel Aviv ranks as the sixth largest cluster in the world (2017 Startup Genome Report). These startups are often successful. Many are acquired by big multinational companies (for example Mobileye in 2017 for 15.3 billion USD in the up to today largest acquisition of the country) or are going public. Israel with a population of only 8.5 million ranks third after the substantially more populous countries of US and China when it comes to the number of companies having IPOed on NASDAQ in the last 40 years (more than 250 Israeli companies). In Israel innovation-startup ecosystem has been and remains to be the result of a bold and forward-looking policy. Initiated in 1968 with a political decision the country has since made the transition from a centralist agricultural society into a competitive knowledge-based innovation economy. Especially since the 1980ies, gloomy desert settlements and barely developed regions have become thriving economic centers with a vibrant startup scene and corporate offices from around the world. The Office of the Chief Scientists (OCS) of the Ministry of Economy (& MATIMOP) was put in charge of supervising, proposing and implementing Israeli innovation policies. Renamed as the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) it still serves today as an independent and impartial public entity for the benefit of the Israeli innovation ecosystem and Israeli economy as a whole. Its role is to nurture and develop Israeli innovation resources, while creating and strengthening the infrastructure and framework needed to support the entire knowledge industry. Among the legion of factors that make up the Israeli ecosystem, the following stand out: R&D: no other country has been spending a greater part of its GDP on military and civil R&D. Venture Capital: only in the US it is more available. Technological Incubator Program: a program that was to create jobs for immigrants became one of the ecosystem’s drivers. Industry-Academia Cooperation: researching for the market & the entrepreneurial spirit at universities. Military: IDF’s special role in molding startup founders. Culture: Chuzpah & networking “one grade removed”. Since its foundation in 1948, the country has invested heavily in military R&D in light of its distinct geopolitical situation and conflict related security threats. This has led the foundation for the development of the computer, security, telecommunications, electronics, and semiconductor industries, the Startup Nation is known for today. In recent decades, support for civil R&D has caught up, with Israel investing around 4.21% of its GDP in R&D in 2013. Based on the Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development funding through its central instrument, the R&D Fund, have had a multiplier effect on private sector research investment. On top of the country’s dire situation, in the 1980ies one million new immigrants (then about 20% of the population) arrived from the former Soviet Union. These mostly well-educated immigrants pushed into the already tight labor market, that was unable to absorb them. Since 1991 a newly established OCS led Technological Incubator Program was to mitigate the situation by helping those new immigrants to start a company on their own. What was primarily intended as a tool to create employment for immigrants, turned out to be crucial for the genesis of the ecosystem. The technology neutral Technological Incubator Program has since sought to mitigate some of the shortcomings of new ventures, such as lack of capital, inexperienced management or lack of understanding regarding markets. For those startups accepted into its 2-year program, it provides a supportive environment with free offices and resources, mentoring, assistance in finding product-market fit and determining technological and marketing feasibility, business and legal advice, investor relations, networking, as well as pre-seed and seed capital. Technology Incubator Programs cover 100% of their Startup’s approved budget during the program period (usually 2 years): 85% (max $ 1 million) via the OCS, 15% from the (today private) incubator operator in exchange for equity. Only if the startup turns out to be successful, the public grant is to be repaid by royalties in the amount of 3-5% of the annual income. Crucially, the 15% private incubator money ensures a diligent assessment whether the startup is promising enough to be accepted into the program. The public investment, on the other hand, allows incubators to support ventures that would otherwise be too risky. Today incubators are licensed under a franchise model by the OCS/IIA for a period of 8 years. Relatively modest use of taxpayer money has catalyzed private capital investment and has indirectly benefited the whole economy through spillovers. Israel took another innovative approach to help establish its Venture Capital (VC) industry. In 1993, the Yozma (Hebrew for “initiative”), often referred to as the most successful and original program in Israel’s history of innovation, offered to match investments by a foreign VC fund with public funds. A lever to start a VC industry was found, and as a result, in recent years only in the US and China has more VC been invested. In order to join the program, an Israeli fund had to cooperate with a foreign investment company. If together they managed to raise USD 12 million, the state would contribute another $ 8 million. In return, the state retained 40% ownership in the newly established fund. However, the private partners had the option to buy back the state’s shares within five years for the amount of the public investment plus interests. Thus, although the state accepted a considerable part of the risk (80% of the downside risk), it allowed private investors to reap the profit. To many foreign investors, this value preposition proved irresistible, and soon demand to join the program had become so high that the necessary amount of foreign investment was raised to $ 16 million. This cooperation was key to the program’s success: While the Israeli part was responsible for relationship management between investors and founders, the international partner contributed its network, market knowledge and experience as a VC-investor to help the startups scale. The plan worked out. Today, Israel ranks top in the availability of VC. Reasons why Israel is so successful Isreal ranks top in university-industry collaboration. Commercialization of academic research is expressly encouraged also through state funded programs. Inventions of academic staff are property of the university, that is commercialized by special affiliated Technology Transfer Organizations (TTOs). Led by experienced business people these for-profit companies ensure the protection of this IP (esp. via patents) and commercialize them. TTOs also link the research institution to industry, startup founders and investors. From royalties received Israeli universities can increase their research budget substantially. Flexible terms of employment for university academic staff and a proportionate participation of the researcher in any royalties resulting from his developments further breed an entrepreneurial spirit in the research departments. R&D departments of big multinational companies are crucial components of the clusters. Big players such as Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Dropbox, Dell, Citibank, Merck Group or SAP tap into the country’s innovative potential – and support the ecosystem at large: They hire engineers, acquire startups or cooperate with them, establish a branded co-working space or run their own accelerator. In only 70 years, Israel’s population has increased more than six fold. This has been due to waves of immigration making Israel a multicultural country of immigrants that continues to actively encourage immigration. Public support programs and a pronounced “welcome culture” facilitate integration of new arrivals. Many immigrants are natural entrepreneurs – they are more willing to take risks than people who have not left their familiar environment in order to start anew in another country in which they are at a disadvantage on the local labor market. Thus, a nation of immigrants is also a nation of entrepreneurs. In Israel, entrepreneurial spirit is regarded highly and founding a startup is the preferred career choice of many. The country’s multicultural set-up together with its open culture of discussion and lack of formal hierarchies breeds creativity. Living in a conflict-stricken region in the Middle East where war can basically break out every day makes people not only enjoy life in spite of this situation (World Happiness Report ranks Israel 11th), but also puts the entrepreneurial risk of founding a startup in perspective. If you cannot be sure whether there will be a war when you will wake up in the morning, founding a startup looks a lot less scary. Israeli entrepreneurs are thus known for being risk-takers and do not shy away from daring decisions. Additionally, failure is understood as part of the entrepreneurial process, and an unsuccessful startup as another stepping stone towards a breakthrough. Improvising is a valuable skill in a Middle East – and comes in handy in a startups inherently unripe processes and systems. The military service is a crucial factor of the Israeli ecosystem, that cannot be replicated. The (for men and women) compulsory army service in the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) helps develop character traits that are useful for aspiring entrepreneurs, such as the ability to make decisions on complex issues under pressure, self-confidence, self-assertion and the ability to work in a team. Many startups are based on technical innovations originating in the army. The Elite Intelligence and Cybersecurity Unit 8200 has been legendary for its graduates and their potential to found successful ventures. Its small domestic market puts Israeli startups at a disadvantage – leading to the prevalent business strategy of “go global fast”. The flipside of a small country is a close-knit network, further strengthened by the shared experience of the military service. A culturally rooted dislike for authorities and hierarchies makes people approachable and ready to help with introductions and advice. The promotion of lighthouse successes – joined together with the aforementioned self-confidence – urges many Israelis into trying to become an acclaimed entrepreneur themselves. Finally, a nation branding campaign has created the label of the “Startup Nation Israel” further attracting interest and attention from investors, big companies and talent alike. Key Learnings for Austria Israel seems to have figured out a way or two to “startup” Innovation-Startup Ecosystems. For Austria especially interesting are the targeted decisions the Israeli government took to help push its innovation ecosystem forward. Special cultural factors and of course the distinct role of the military aside, targeted policies played a crucial role in establishing an VC-industry, integrating immigrants to become entrepreneurs, inviting MNC into the country and encouraging academic-industry cooperation. However, as in all case studies, also with the Israeli Startup experience, the role of its specific history, cultural aspects and geopolitical situation may not be underestimated when lessons shall be derived for other ecosystems.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blogposts_hubs-300x181.jpg","December 29th, 2018","en",0.995660364627838,0.009140238922555,0.834236601988474,0.0787148820236325,0.0779082694401344

"https://austrianstartups.com/later-stage-breakfast/","AustrianStartups","Our first Growth Stage Breakfast","OKR & Managing Growth OKR systems. What exactly are they? What do later stage startups know about them and how do they use them effectively or not so effectively? All these questions have been discussed at AustrianStartups’ very first “Later Stage Breakfast” – an event for later stage startups who talk about their previous experiences while having breakfast together. The attendants of the first event were HappyMed, Shpock, Blockpit, Hackabu, Bikemap to only name a few. Before we tell you all the insights of the event, let’s start by unveiling what exactly OKR’s are: “OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results”, according to http://eleganthack.com. “The form of the OKR has been more or less standardized. The Objective is qualitative, and the KR’s (most often three) are quantitative. They are used to focus a group or individual around a bold goal. The objective sets a goal for a set period of time, usually a quarter. The key results tell you if the objective has been met by the end of the time.” How does this concern us? Basically, founders of later stage startups met up with AustrianStartups last week to talk about their own experiences with setting objectives and what their key learnings with OKR’s have been so far. Let’s see what they came up with! The key finding There are four main point you have to consider when implementing OKR systems in your startup: Your goals have to be measurable (& actionable). It’s basic knowledge, but it’s key. Every team member ought to be kept updated constantly about the current status of every KR. A way to implement this, is to have weekly, monthly or quarterly townhalls with every team member. There is no correct system on implementing OKR’s. Every startup should experiment what works best for them and their company. OKR systems come hand in hand with extra effort and lots of extra time that has to be invested, especially in the beginning. However, all these aspects combined will give your company a tool to help you focus on your business goals and measure your outcome, not just your output! What else to consider. Ok, we all know now that OKR’s can be a significant tool for your startup, as well as the main findings of startups who have already implemented OKR’s into their everyday business. Is there something else to consider? Yes. It’s also important to realize that there is no “too early” for implementing an OKR system. Just start with setting objectives for your management, as well as objectives for each department of your business, and experiment with it. “Each department can take the time for an individual brainstorming session where all ideas are welcome. The output of these sessions can be sorted and structured to make it measurable: the only thing left is to present it to the management which will then in turn, either officially approve it or not” Philipp from HappyMed recommends. Furthermore, it’s relevant to understand that OKR’s and the culture of your company are not working exclusively without one another. It’s quite the opposite: OKR’s can even be used to engage and enhance the intrinsic motivation of each worker: Want to implement OKR systems yourself? “These tools will help you” , says Theresa from Hackabu, before sharing some tips and tricks on the subject: Airtable – an online spreadsheet that gives you the power of a database to organize anything. Confluence – a commercial Wiki software that helps you communicating within your company. Google Sheets – a mash-up between Google Docs and Excel. weekdone – helps you plan weekly and set your goals quarterly. Ally – a flexible wage software that helps you with payroll accounting. To end it off. As we have previously mentioned, there is no perfect time to start OKR’s in your business. With the right tools and great motivation, it can support and improve your startup. Remember: “Do not over engineer. Adapt to your needs.” as Cornelius Palm from Blockpit puts it. And don’t give up, if something goes wrong – take the time to experiment and establish the best system for your own startup!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Breakfast_Nov18-e1543494062474-300x274.jpg","November 27th, 2018","en",0.993505477905273,3.9516256947536e-05,0.969607949256897,0.00233153603039682,0.0280209183692932

We changed and grew with the requirements. Last year we presented our AustrianStartup Agenda to the government, built further support networks and kickstarted several new event series. But that’s just the beginning. We are excited to take further steps! Besides changing policies and culture, we want to cater to specific needs of startups in Austria and take the voice to global stages. While watching over Innsbruck we talked about the future of AustrianStartups and discussed further steps and directions. The results: A new vision, a new logo, a new chapter of AustrianStartups. “The Innsbruck Network” Our team had the pleasure of being invited to the final pitches of the Skinnovation event. Besides getting a good perspective of the local startup environment, we had the chance to meet many interesting people and connect with the local startup community. On Sunday we also had the opportunity to meet with WKT Vice President Barbara Thaler and the startup commissioner of the Junge Wirtschaft Tyrol Stefan Engl for a great brunch in the “Base Eins”, who work energetically on the development of the startup ecosystem development in Tyrol. There we had the chance to talk about the Austrian ecosystem – about achievements and further needs & points of focus- and exchange experience & thoughts.

"https://austrianstartups.com/message-new-managing-director/","AustrianStartups","A message from the new Managing Director","Four years ago, I started to get interested in startups. Fresh from the rewarding experience of building up my own football club, I looked for ways to make similar experiences in my professional life. AustrianStartups was exactly what I needed. It was my first contact point and helped me find my first job in the startup scene – taking over the lead of the Pioneers Challenge at Pioneers Festival. Now, four years and many challenging experiences later, I’m excited to take over as managing director at the very same organization that helped me so much at the beginning of my startup adventure. Since those early days, AustrianStartups has grown into a respected player in the ecosystem and certainly had a lasting positive impact on numerous startups in Austria. I’m excited to continue this development and reach new milestones with our highly motivated team. We do not want to create an artificial hype, but deliver well-grounded insights into why startups are an important part of our economy, and actively support them in their development. With this in mind, we already carved out some strategic goals for the future that range from establishing an independent startup think tank to becoming more international as an organization. Still, my plan for the next few weeks will primarily be to listen. I want to talk to as many of you as possible to make sure I really understand the needs and concerns of all stakeholders in the startup ecosystem. So whenever you see me at a startup event, please approach me and tell me how we could make your startup’s life easier. Yesterday, I already had some interesting conversations at our monthly Stammtisch and several people indicated that it would be helpful if AustrianStartups could offer guidelines for legal and financial documents that startups often need. I think that’s a great idea, and we will definitely check what we can offer here. In general, I was blown away by the positive response and optimism for the whole ecosystem. Your enthusiasm will be a great source of energy for the whole team of AustrianStartups. To translate our visions into reality, we will need to further grow as an organization – so in case you want to join us in our quest to make Austria a startup hotspot, please apply for one of our volunteer positions here: austrianstartups.com/jobs/. I promise that you will be part of an amazing team, take over responsibility, learn a lot, and ultimately have a strong impact. Speaking of the team, I want to say thank you. Thank you for giving me such a warm welcome and working so diligently during the last few weeks, when it was still unclear who is going to take over. With your help and the support of our partners, I’m absolutely convinced that together we can lift the Austrian startup ecosystem to the next level. And now enough of the talking, let’s buckle down to work. I can’t wait to get going and help make Austria the place to be for all startups.

"https://austrianstartups.com/navigate-corporate-world-startup/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #48: How to navigate the corporate world as a startup","Maneuvering corporate partnerships can be tricky. Especially in the early stages of your startup. And having to dedicate a large amount of your resources to corporate partnerships that turn out to be less beneficial than initially expected is a waste of time, resources and obviously money you probably won’t have at that stage. Together with Maria Zesch, Chief Commercial Officer T-Mobile Austria, Christian Adelsberger, Founder and CEO of Parkbob, David Pichsenmeister, Co-Founder of Oratio and Oliver Csendes, CEO of Pioneers we discussed this hot topic. So consider these things before or when entering a partnership: Know what you want and what you can expect from the partnership. As a startup you need to know what you’re after. Be aware of what you want to get out of that partnership. Expectations are often too high as well. Just because a corporate offers a huge brand doesn’t mean that partnering up is automatically beneficial for your startup. So how can you know what to expect from your partnership? (Theoretically) It’s relatively simple… Communicate with your partners! Startups and corporates alike often make the mistake of not clarifying their goals and expectations at the beginning of a partnership. Both parties need to be clear about what they are bringing to the table and what they want to achieve by partnering up. You should also try to get a sense about the corporate’s intentions as early as possible. Ask them about what they would like to achieve by partnering up with you. And last but not least, always try to communicate and work with top management. Because top management support will make navigating completely different internal processes much easier. Be the driving force of the partnership. You are the agile startup. Don’t expect large corporates to change rapidly. A much bigger company is obviously going to have a harder time changing or speeding up internal processes than a startup. So those processes are definitely going to differ in speed. And there needs to be someone who coordinates said speed difference. This is where top management comes into play again: You need to communicate that you need the freedom to do your job and not be slowed down by large corporate processes. And securing that is going to be much easier by communicating and working with top level management. As high as you can get! And as Christian, CEO of Parkbob put it: “You have to be constantly meeting people, push topics again and again so they happen. Waiting for things to happen is not going to work.” Understand your partner. When pitching to corporates, always remember that at the end of the day for them it’s going to be about either saving money or making money by cooperating with your startup. Understand the value creation and business model of the corporate you’re potentially partnering up with and understand how your solution can fit into that. And like Oliver, CEO of Pioneers said, “Corporations are not there to help you. You’re there to earn money.” So always be clear about what you are selling and how it can help the corporate to reach its goals. Because that is what they’re looking for. You should also be aware of the corporate’s innovation strategy and the market they want to tackle by working with you. If it’s something completely different from what you do and you decide to work with a large corporate in an early stage of your startup, chances are that the large influx of money – compared to that of other customers you’re going to have at that stage – may force you in a direction you didn’t want to go for in the first place. Oliver’s Red flag: “If you ask them about their goals, like tweaking their business model, a better understanding of their internal ecosystem or a specific solution you might be able to hack for them and they say yes to everything, they probably don’t know what they are looking for and want to cooperate with startups because everybody else is doing it.” Understand your partner’s culture. How can you make sure that you can still achieve your goals if that one person who’s driving innovation leaves the company you’ve partnered up with? Culture. Try to get a sense for the internal culture of your (potential) corporate partner. And how does one go about getting said sense? Top level management! Because if top management doesn’t support a startup friendly culture, you’re going to have a hard time. A good trick to test the waters is asking for a meeting with the company’s CEO. If a CEO won’t give you 15 minutes of his or her time, chances are the internal corporate culture is not the best foundation for an early stage startup. Again: Full top management support is what you should be aiming for. Share your knowledge. But don’t share it mindlessly. David’s Red flag (Co-Founder of Oratio): “If a corporate approaches you and asks for free stuff right from the get go, be careful. If they’re asking for free workshops, product customizations or pilots, chances are they’re trying to use you as a cheap agency.” But don’t forget to consider that corporates need to know and fully understand the product and its value in order to move forward. Try to keep both aspects in mind. And again, communication and knowledge of your own goals are key here: What can both parties do for each other? Generally though, charging money for additional services your startup delivers – even if it’s not a huge amount – usually guarantees that a greenlighting decision is going to be made from higher up the chain. Which – as we know now – is a good thing. Get to know the people you are going to be working with At the end of the day it’s always people you’re working with. And while business knowledge is obviously your bread and butter, you should also really take a look at the people who will drive, manage, coordinate and control the relationships between their corporate and your startup. If the people whom you are dealing with don’t have passion for what they are doing, you should look at other partnership opportunities. So what should you take away from this month’s Stammtisch? Understand that there’s no free lunch. It’s a business relationship and both parties need to work on that. Be clear about what you’re investing and what you want. Communication! Preferably with top level management. Be the active party. You’re the agile, small startup. Constantly push topics and request meetings. Understand your potential corporate partner and the internal culture within said corporate. Try to understand things from their perspective. Share your knowledge but be aware of how or if that can benefit your startup. And get to know the people. Sometimes it’s more about gut feeling. Are the people you’re going to be working with passionate about the project? Is there chemistry between the people involved? And don’t forget that the best startups have lots of pitch-meetings. So don’t rush into things. That being said, see you at the next Stammtisch! © Markus Engelberger/graphicrecorder.at","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/579T2070-300x200.jpg","July 27th, 2017","en",0.993459045886993,0.211828872037586,0.471946716308594,0.293747089803219,0.0224773436784744
"https://austrianstartups.com/need-to-court-international-startups/","AustrianStartups","“We need to do more to court international startups”","“We need to do more to court international startups” Ruth Reitmeier Profil Portfolio spoke with Markus Raunig, Head of AustrianStartups, about Vienna’s advantages and flaws as a location for founders and challenges of the startup scene. Portfolio: Markus, are you the “Leitl” of startups? Markus Raunig (laughs): Not at all, I don’t see myself as an equivalent to Christoph Leitl, President of the Austrian Economic Chambers. AustrianStartups is a grassroots movement from the startup community with no compulsory membership fees. What are your key responsibilities and tasks? Markus: AustrianStartups is the first stop for anyone interested in startup topics. We support founders, organize events, and act as the voice for the startup scene. Currently we are working on a new position paper to be ready by the forthcoming election on 15th October. This is our big project during the summer. Before discussing the key points of the new position paper, a more general question about the Viennese startup scene: Last year, Vienna seemed to fall behind in the race for best location, but now things are looking up. The acquisition of the Viennese startup mySugr by Roche is the largest digital health startup deal in Europe. The city is also a hotspot for chatbot development. Is there a turnaround? Markus: Indeed, a lot happened recently, and in bots development Vienna is one of the top 3 locations worldwide. Among …? Markus: Austin and Berlin. Vienna is at the forefront of things. However, the city has another strength. Vienna has an international reputation as a top location for early-stage startups. In Europe, we have probably the widest range of support programs for company founders. Vienna also has flaws as a startup location. Red tape? Markus: Bureaucracy will be a key point in our new position paper. It will deal specifically with the notary act, trade regulation, which is a real obstacle to many digital business models, and the topic of employee participation. In international startups employees joining the company during the take-off and growth stages usually have share options as part of their salaries. In Austria this is only possible, if at all, by taking contractual detours. Perhaps, a new legal form for startups would be needed. The current situation is enormously disadvantageous when competing internationally. Is this fight for real? Markus: Absolutely. Cities compete for the best startups. Internationally, it is quite common to court a successful startup just like a big corporation. And Vienna? Markus: International startups are not courted the same way as corporations. It is necessary to make founding and the allocation of grants as uncomplicated as possible. A top startup has the same potential to create jobs as a large company. Are you thinking of a specific case? Markus: A frequently discussed example is Spire. (Spire uses nano-satellite technology to locate lost aircrafts or containers). Spire, was successfully established by an Austrian over in the US, and he wanted to set up the European headquarters in Austria. But he finally chose Scotland as a location where he received significantly more financial support. Is it worth investing heavily in startups? Ultimately, many fail. Markus: But those that manage to grow, generate a tremendous dynamic. Looking into the future, some of today’s startups will be among the largest companies in the country. And it is also very important what happens after the startup stage. Runtastic is a good example of this: the founders are key investors in other startups and they share their know-how as mentors. The requirement of the startup scene for tax relief for venture capitalists remains unfulfilled. Written off? Markus: No, this point will definitely be in our new paper. In Austria we have hardly any large-scale financing, because private investors do not have the option to write off losses. In Austria there is enough money available and it would be a pity, if we do not manage to win more investment for startups. The Viennese scene is criticized as too focused on lifestyle. Is there something to this? Markus: This image of the startup scene really annoys me. It does not reflect reality. Building up a company is hard. It takes a lot of hard graft and it is a roller coaster of emotions. One day, you are on top of the world believing that your wonderful idea is all conquering. But it can be all over the next day, because you get a cancellation. To get through that you need a lot of grit and a lot of belief in what you are doing.

"https://austrianstartups.com/regierungsprogramm-2020-die-startup-perspektive-2/","AustrianStartups","Das Regierungsprogramm 2020 aus der Startup Perspektive","Gestern wurde das Programm der neuen Bundesregierung vorgestellt – wir haben uns angeschaut, welche Empfehlungen unserer Austrian Startup Agenda es hinein geschafft haben, was es generell für spannende Neuigkeiten für Gründer gibt und welche wichtigen Punkte definitiv fehlen. Generelle Einschätzung Das Regierungsprogramm ist ein großer Schritt in die richtige Richtung und beinhaltet zahlreiche Punkte, die wir schon lange fordern und dringend umgesetzt gehören. Von den 37 Empfehlungen unserer diesjährigen Austrian Startup Agenda finden sich insgesamt 19 im Papier wieder – darunter eine Modernisierung der Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte, konkrete Maßnahmen zur Förderung von Entrepreneurial Education, eine neue digitale Rechtsform für Startups, eine Entlastung des Faktors Arbeit, der Aufbau regulatorischer Sandboxes, Bürokratieabbau bei Förderungen, Steuererleichterungen für Investoren, die Aktivierung institutionellem Kapital aus Pensionskassen sowie eine verstärkte Förderung von Social Entrepreneurship und grünen Technologien. Wir finden die im Programm gezeichnete Vision von Österreich als international führendem Greentech Hotspot großartig. Die besten Visionen sind in der Startup Welt aber nichts wert, wenn die zentralen Maßnahmen nicht rasch umgesetzt werden. In den letzten Jahren haben wir den Anschluss an die führenden europäischen Startup-Hotspots verloren, weil wir es nicht geschafft haben, die PS schnell auf die Straße zu bringen. Dementsprechend lautet diesmal auch unser dringender Appell an die neue Bundesregierung: It’s all about the execution! Wenn wir wirklich in der Champions League mitspielen und eine europäische Vorreiterrolle übernehmen wollen, dann müssen wir die oben angesprochenen zentralen Maßnahmen noch im Jahr 2020 umsetzen – sonst werden andere Länder wieder schneller sein. The Good Folgende Empfehlungen aus der Austrian Startup Agenda haben wir im Regierungsprogramm wieder gefunden. 1) Entrepreneurship Education in allen Pflichtschulen implementieren Entrepreneurship Education: Erarbeitung eines Konzepts, um unternehmerisches Denken im Bildungssystem zu verankern. Z.B. freiwillige „Unternehmerwoche“ ab der Oberstufe, um Berufsbilder und Wirtschaftsbetriebe kennen zu lernen und Zugang zu unternehmerischem Denken zu ermöglichen (s.89) Kooperation von Schulen mit Unternehmen ausbauen (z.B. Unternehmenswoche) (s.87) <U+21D2> Endlich. Am Konzept arbeiten wir schon. 2) Programmier-Unterricht ab der Volksschule einfu¨hren Schülerinnen und Schüler sollen sich in allen Fächern digitaler Technologie für ihren individuellen Lernfortschritt bedienen können. Dazu sollen facheinschlägige Kompetenzen (z.B. Coding/Programmieren) in die betreffenden Lehrpläne eingearbeitet werden. (s. 292) „Digitale Kompetenzen“ werden als Unterrichtsprinzip verankert (s.293) Flächendeckende Evaluierung der „Digitalen Grundbildung“ (s.293) <U+21D2> Hier erhoffen wir uns eine baldige Konkretisierung zur geplanten Einarbeitung in die betreffenden Lehrpläne und eine rasche Reaktion auf die Evaluierungsergebnisse des Masterplan “Digitale Grundbildung”. 3) Gru¨ndungszentren & Entrepreneurship-Fo¨rderung in Hochschulen Auftrag an Hochschulen und Forschungseinrichtungen, um Gründungskulturen und Entrepreneurship-Denken auszubauen. Aufnahme in Leistungsvereinbarungen sowie Fortführung und Ausbau des Programms Spin-Off Fellowships und Stärkung von Female Entrepreneurship (s.313) Schaffung von „Innovation Labs“ an wichtigen Bildungsstandorten und damit Schaffung eines Zugangs für alle Angehörigen der Hochschulen sowie für Lehrlinge und andere Auszubildende zu u.a. Medienlabs, Prototypenfertigung (unter Anleitung von Technikerinnen und Technikern), Arbeitsplätzen und Beratungen (s.324) <U+21D2> Die Aufnahme in die Leistungsvereinbarung ist ein enorm wichtiger Schritt und sollte als Basis dienen, um Incentives für Ausgründungen auf den Fakultäten zu schaffen. 4) Interdisziplina¨re Masterstudienga¨nge & Projektarbeiten fo¨rdern Die Möglichkeit zur Gründung interdisziplinärer Unternehmen erweitern (s.89) Steigerung der Durchlässigkeit zwischen und innerhalb der Hochschulsektoren sowie Optimierung der Anerkennung (auch von Vorleistungen aus nichtakademischen Bildungswegen) – „kein Abschluss ohne Anschluss“ (s.306) <U+21D2> Eine rasche Konkretisierung und Incentivierung der Universitäten wäre hier wünschenswert. 5) Female Entrepreneurship Initiative starten Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zur Stärkung der Rolle von Frauen in der Unternehmerschaft und damit zu spezifischen Förderprogrammen in der Gründungssituation. (s.96) <U+21D2> Gutes Bekenntnis, wir wünschen uns baldige konkrete Maßnahmen. 6) Moderne Rechtsform fu¨r Wachstumsunternehmen einfu¨hren Neue Gesellschaftsform schaffen: Aufbauend auf internationalen Beispielen soll eine neue Kapitalgesellschaftsform geschaffen werden, die besonders fu¨r innovative Startups und Gru¨nderinnen bzw. Gru¨nder in ihrer Fru¨hphase eine international wettbewerbsfa¨hige Option bietet. (s.89) Unbu¨rokratische Gru¨ndung (Stammkapital-Ansparmodelle, digitale Beho¨rdenwege, Englisch als Amtssprache) Flexible Anteilsvergabe an mo¨gliche Investorinnen und Investoren sowie Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter (mit minimalen, digitalen Beho¨rdenwegen) Angepasst an o¨sterreichische Standards (z.B. Transparenz aller Gesellschafterinnen und Gesellschafter) Einsatz auf europa¨ischer Ebene, dass eine einheitliche, zeitgema¨ße Gesellschaftsform fu¨r innovative Start-ups und KMUs EU-weit umgesetzt wird („EU Limited“) (s.89) <U+21D2> Das klingt sehr vielversprechend und wäre ein großer Wurf. Eine unbürokratische digitale Gründung auf Englisch, einfache Mitarbeiterbeteiligung und eine Anwendbarkeit im gesamten EU-Raum würden österreichischen Gründern das Leben definitiv erleichtern. 7) Gru¨ndungsprozess vollsta¨ndig digitalisieren Unbu¨rokratische Gru¨ndung (Stammkapital-Ansparmodelle, digitale Beho¨r- denwege, Englisch als Amtssprache) (s.89) Weiterentwicklung des Unternehmensserviceportals (USP) zu einer umfassenden Plattform für die Interaktion zwischen Unternehmen und Verwaltung (inkl. Förderansuchen etc.) (s.321) <U+21D2> Bereits im Herbst durch die Übergangsregierung umgesetzt worden, wird hier eine weitere Vereinfachung angedacht. 8) Faktor Arbeit durch Einkommenssteuer und Lohnnebenkosten nachhaltig entlasten Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zu einer Entlastung der Menschen in Österreich. Um Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer, Pensionistinnen und Pensionisten, Selbständige sowie Land- und Forstwirte insbesondere mit geringen und mittleren Einkommen spürbar zu entlasten, sollen die erste, zweite und dritte Stufe des Einkommensteuertarifs reduziert werden: von 25% auf 20%, 35% auf 30% und 42% auf 40% (s.77) Prüfung der Potenziale zur Senkung der Lohnnebenkosten ohne Leistungsreduktion (s.81) <U+21D2> Die Lohnnebenkostensenkung war noch in jedem Regierungsprogramm dabei (und wurde trotzdem nie umgesetzt), aber ein konkreter Plan für die Senkung der Einkommenssteuer ist erfreulich – hier müssen wir als Standort insgesamt wettbewerbsfähiger werden und das wäre ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung. 9) Sandboxes fu¨r disruptive Gescha¨ftsfelder einfu¨hren Regulatory Sandboxes umsetzen: Innovative Technologien, Produkte und Dienstleistungen sollen in ihrer Fru¨hphase mit Blick auf europa¨ische und internationale Entwicklungen in einem wettbewerbsneutralen Rahmen, der nach objektiven Kriterien ausgestaltet ist, erprobt werden ko¨nnen, wenn ihre Anwendung sonst rechtlich nicht gedeckt ist (z.B. innovative Startups/KMUs, die neue Gescha¨ftsmodelle, Technologien, Dienstleistungen oder Produkte vertreiben wollen, die sich durch die bestehende Gewerbeordnung nicht abdecken lassen). Dabei soll es zu enger Zusammenarbeit mit der zusta¨ndigen Aufsichtsbeho¨rde kommen, um das betroffene Modell zu testen und zu adaptieren. Ab einem bestimmten Reifegrad (zeitlich bestimmt oder durch Unternehmensgro¨ße) soll ein U¨bergang ins regula¨re Gewerbesystem stattfinden. (s.89) <U+21D2> Wichtige Initiative, die in England im Fintech-Bereich sehr gut gegriffen hat und über die wir schon lange reden. Umso wichtiger ist eine schnelle Umsetzung. 10) Beteiligungsfreibetrag fu¨r Startup-Investoren einfu¨hren Prüfung einer steuerlichen Absetzbarkeit von Anschub- und Wachstumsfinanzie- rung für innovative Start-ups und KMUs mit Obergrenze pro Investment (z.B. € 100.000 über 5 Jahre absetzbar) und einer Gesamtdeckelung – nach Vorbild des er- folgreichen (Seed) Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS/EIS) in Großbritannien. (s.97) <U+21D2> Das hier erst mal nur “geprüft” werden soll ist etwas besorgniserregend. Das Modell gibt es seit Jahren als Best Practice und wurde schon mehrmals für eine Umsetzung in Österreich angedacht. Unsere Empfehlung: Dementsprechend schnell prüfen und noch dieses Jahr umsetzen – Großbritannien hat die positiven Effekte gezeigt. 11) Fondsbesteuerung klarstellen und modernisieren Start-up und KMU-Finanzierung: Um den österreichischen Standort und vor allem die Gründung neuer Unternehmen mit innovativen Ideen (inkl. Social Entrepreneurship) und deren Wachstum zu fördern soll privates Risikokapital mobilisiert werden, z.B. durch die Einführung und Lockerung der Verlustverrechnungsmöglichkeit bei Einkünften aus Kapitalvermögen. Aktuell können private Investorinnen und Investoren Verluste aus der Beteiligung an Startups nur mit bestimmten positiven Kapitaleinkünften und nur im gleichen Jahr ausgleichen – zukünftig soll die Verlustverrechnung auch über mehrere Jahre hinweg erfolgen können. (s.97) <U+21D2> Endlich. Wichtiger Schritt um Startup Investments für Investoren attraktiver zu machen. 12) Stiftungen & Pensionskassen Investitionen im Startup-Bereich ermöglichen Institutionelle Investoren, wie Pensionskassen, Vorsorgekassen und Versicherungen sollen in langfristige, innovative Anlageformen (inkl. ökologischem und Social Impact) investieren dürfen (z.B. Seed-Finanzierung für Start-Ups und KMUs). Die zugrundeliegenden Kataloge zulässiger Veranlagungen sollen entsprechend angepasst werden (in Einklang mit EU-Recht). (s.97) Reform und Attraktivierung des Privatstiftungsrechts im internationalen Vergleich unter Stärkung der Begünstigtenstellung (s.32) <U+21D2> Jawoll! Bei den Stiftungen sollte man noch etwas konkreter werden, aber die Pensionskassen sind ein riesen Schritt, um Wachstumskapital aus Österreich zu mobilisieren und die gesamte Gesellschaft an den Digitalisierungsgewinnen teilhaben zu lassen. 13) Dachfond zur Wachstumsfinanzierung errichten Aufbau eines nationalen staatlich kofinanzierten Technologie-, Innovations- und Wachstums-Fonds, der Risikokapital zur Verfügung stellt und so die nachhaltige Etablierung von europäischen Schlüsseltechnologien unterstützt (aufbauend auf bestehende Mittelstands- und Gründerfonds) (s. 323) Ausbau der Verfügbarkeit von Wachstumskapital für Start-Ups und KMUs (Finanzierungsvolumen € 2 Mio. bis € 20 Mio.) in Zusammenarbeit mit privaten Investorinnen und Investoren. Mögliche internationale Beispiele wären z.B. Modell Schweiz (Corporate Venture Fund unter Einbindung österreichischer Leitbetriebe) oder Modell Dänemark (Dachfonds/Fund of Funds Lösung). (s.97) <U+21D2> Wichtiger Punkt, Umsetzung ist entscheidend – Agilität und ausreichende Kapitalausstattung sind entscheidend, um auch international eine Rolle zu spielen. 14) Entscheidungsstrukturen bei Förderungen beschleunigen & transparenter gestalten Planungssicherheit und Bürokratieabbau bei Förderungen (z.B. Entscheidung über Förderanträge innerhalb definierter Fristen, objektive Wirkungsziele, Abwicklungskooperationen von Bund und Ländern) (s. 92) <U+21D2> Sehr gut, bitte rasch umsetzen und Fristen ambitioniert setzen. 15) Social Entrepreneurship nachhaltig fo¨rdern Zielgruppenspezifische öffentliche Finanzierungsinstrumente bzw. Ausweitung und Öffnung bestehender Finanzierungsprogramme für Social Entrepreneurs (s.98) Prüfung einer Reform der Gemeinnützigkeitsbestimmung durch Ausweitung auf Social Entrepreneurs (s.98) <U+21D2> Absolut sinnvoll. 16) Fo¨rderbonus fu¨r Teams mit weiblichen Gru¨ndern fla¨chendeckend einfu¨hren Die Bundesregierung bekennt sich zur Stärkung der Rolle von Frauen in der Unternehmerschaft und damit zu spezifischen Förderprogrammen in der Gründungssituation. (s.96) <U+21D2> Konkretisierung wünschenswert. 17) Professionelles Standort-Marketing starten Den Erfolg österreichischer Unternehmen auf ausländischen Märkten stärken und ausbauen: Alle bestehenden Bemühungen in der Außenwirtschaft – von den Ministerien, von Branchenvertreterinnen bzw. -vertretern und privaten Initiativen – künftig noch besser koordinieren (s.90) Aktive Bewerbung des Standorts Österreich im Ausland, durch verstärkte Zusammenarbeit aller relevanten Stellen des Wirtschafts- und Außenministeriums, sowie der Wirtschaftskammer Österreich (s.90) Ausrichtung der ABA-Unit „Work in Austria“ als zentrale Plattform für die Anwerbung von Spezialistinnen und Spezialisten aus dem Ausland (s.87) <U+21D2> Die Bündelung der Koordination durch eine Organisation macht Sinn. Bitte dabei nicht auf die speziellen Bedürfnisse von Startups vergessen – enger Austausch mit Gründern macht hier Sinn. 18) Wettbewerbsfa¨hige Rot-Weiß-Rot Card fu¨r Startups einfu¨hren Rot-Weiß-Rot-Karte (RWR-Karte) reformieren: Konsolidierung des gesetzlichen Rahmens, One-Stop-Shop bei der Austrian Business Agency, Antragstellung vereinfachen, Verfahren straffen, Senkung von Gehaltsgrenzen (s.87) <U+21D2> Yes! Das klingt vielversprechend. Bitte jetzt wirklich ambitioniert sein und keine halben Sachen machen. Berlin schafft eine Antwort binnen 5 Werktagen, Frankreich gibt überhaupt Kontingente frei – jede Verbesserung ist gut, für echte Wettbewerbsfähigkeit müssen wir uns aber an den internationalen Best Practices orientieren. 19) Regionale Startup Cluster fo¨rdern und international profilieren Auf Stärken bauen: Bestehende Stärken wie z.B. die Mobilitätsindustrie, erneuerbare Energien und Umwelttechnik, Biotechnologie, Mikroelektronik, Landwirt- schaft, Tourismus und andere müssen weiter ausgebaut, weiterentwickelt und durch gemeinsame Bemühungen der Wirtschaft und der Politik international beworben werden. (s.88) <U+21D2> Sinnvoll, internationale Bewerbung ist definitiv noch ausbaufähig. The Bad Wenn alle oben angeführten Punkte schnell umgesetzt werden, dann ist das schon ein riesiger Schritt für die österreichische Wettbewerbsfähigkeit im Bereich Innovation, Technologie und Startups. Trotzdem gibt es ein paar Punkte aus der Austrian Startup Agenda, die wir im neuen Regierungsprogramm besonders schmerzlich vermissen: 1) Trend Monitoring für zukunftsfitte Lehrinhalte Unser Bildungssystem ist zu träge – derzeit implementieren wir gerade die Änderungen, die wir schon vor 20 Jahren hätten einführen müssen, anstatt uns mit den Anforderungen des Arbeitsmarkts der Zukunft zu beschäftigen. Wir hoffen, dass die neue Bundesregierung das erkennt und unserem Ruf nach einem Rat fu¨r zukunftsfitte Bildung, der durch kontinuierliches Technologie- und Trend Monitoring ja¨hrlich Empfehlungen fu¨r neue Lehrinhalte auf allen Bildungs-Levels gibt, doch noch nachkommt. 2) Gewerberecht ins 21. Jahrhundert bringen Bei den letzten Regierungsprogrammen war die dringend notwendige Reform der Gewerbeordnung stets enthalten, wurde am Ende aber nie sinnvoll umgesetzt. Es ist traurig, dass die bestehenden Marktteilnehmer hier scheinbar erfolgreich für eine Beibehaltung der zumeist protektionistischen Auflagen lobbyiert haben. Um Unternehmertum in Österreich wirklich zu erleichtern braucht es hier entweder eine komplette Neuordnung nach sinnvollen Kriterien, oder zumindest eine Befreiung für Jungunternehmen in den ersten Jahren. 3) Förderprozesse flexibilisieren Es ist gut und wichtig, dass sich die neue Bundesregierung vorgenommen hat das Fördersystem zu entbürokratisieren. Um Förderungen allerdings wirklich attraktiv für Startups zu machen, ist eine Flexibilisierung der Förderprozesse mindestens ebenso wichtig. Innovative Jungunternehmen leben von ihrer Fähigkeit schnell und unkompliziert auf Marktfeedback zu reagieren – wenn diese Agilität durch rigide Förderrichtlinien zu Grunde geht, dann verlieren Förderungen schnell ihre positive Wirkung. Hier sollte also unbedingt noch nachgebessert werden. 4) Startup Visum auf Schiene bringen Mit der dringend notwendigen Reform der Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte setzt die neue Regierung einen wichtigen Schritt, um Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen die besten Mitarbeiter nach Österreich zu holen. Gleichzeitig haben sich Türkis und Grün zum Ziel gesetzt auch die besten Unternehmer anzulocken (…wollen wir uns in Zukunft koordiniert dafür einsetzen, internationale Unternehmensansiedlungen … für den Standort Österreich zu gewinnen., s.88). Um diesem Ziel gerecht zu werden, wird auch eine Reform des sogenannten Startup Visums notwendig sein, das in den vergangenen Jahren durch viel zu strikte Kriterien und ausufernde Bürokratie ganze 3 Mal vergeben wurde. 5) Unabha¨ngigen Startup Beirat einberufen Bei aller Zuversicht vermissen wir ein Element ganz besonders – die nachhaltige Verankerung der innovativen Gründer-Perspektive in öffentlichen und politischen Institutionen. Besonders in der Startup-Welt, in der Veränderung die einzige Konstante ist, macht ein regelmäßig festgesetzter Dialog mit Experten aus der Praxis viel Sinn, um Pläne laufend zu aktualisieren. Unser Vorschlag: Ein unabhängiger Startup-Beirat der die Regierung bei Tech-Agenden unterstützt und direkt Feedback zu geplanten Initiativen gibt. The Noteworthy Auch mit 37 Empfehlungen deckt unsere Austrian Startup Agenda nur einen Teil des notwendigen Reformbedarfs in Österreich ab. Deshalb freuen wir uns, dass es auch einige weitere Punkte im Regierungsprogramm gibt, die aus einer Startup-Perspektive spannend scheinen: Österreich als Greentech Hotspot Neue Sektoren erschließen: Entstehende Sta¨rken, in denen O¨sterreich relevante Wettbewerbsvorteile aufweist, mu¨ssen vor dem Hintergrund der Technologieneutralita¨t weiterentwickelt werden, O¨sterreichs internationales Profil darin gesta¨rkt und durch o¨sterreichische Produkte weltweit ein Beitrag zur CO2-Reduktion geleistet werden – wie z.B. digitale Gescha¨ftsmodelle, forschungsintensive Industrien, Modelle der Kreislaufwirtschaft, die E-Mobilita¨t, die Nutzung von gru¨nem Wasserstoff in Verkehr und Industrie, Gesundheitswirtschaft und andere Bereiche, die auf O¨sterreichs Verbindung von Grundlagenforschung, angewandter Forschung und industriellem Know-how bauen. (s.88) Stärkere Ausrichtung nationaler Maßnahmen am „Green Deal“ der EU-Kommission (s.88-89): Identifikation und Umsetzung von Leuchtturmprojekten im Bereich der O¨kologisierung Entwicklung eines strategischen Maßnahmenplans fu¨r Umwelttechnologien sowie fu¨r die Kreislauf- und Recyclingwirtschaft Fo¨rderung der Entwicklung einer regionalen Kreislaufwirtschaft sowie Kreislaufwirtschaftsprojekten Koordinierte Teilnahme an relevanten IPCEI-Programmen (Important Project of Common European Interest), z.B. Mikroelektronik, Wasserstoff, Batterien Umsetzung einer „Green Finance Agenda“ auf europäischer Ebene: Im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel werden wir auch den tatkräftigen Beitrag von Start-ups und KMUs brauchen, die jene Innovationen beschleunigen, die uns ein CO2-neutrales Leben und Wirtschaften ermöglichen. Die Bundesregierung wird sich daher auf europäischer Ebene dafür einsetzen, dass Banken für Kredite, die effektiv dazu beitragen, den Übergang zu einer nachhaltigen, klimaneutralen Wirtschaft zu beschleunigen, weniger Eigenkapital hinterlegen müssen. Ein solcher „Green Supporting Factor“ würde die Vergabe von „grünen Krediten“ erleichtern und somit einen wertvollen Beitrag zur Erreichung unserer europäischen Klimaziele leisten. (s.72) <U+21D2> Eine einmalige Chance hier wirklich Vorreiter zu sein. Wir haben schon einen bemerkenswerten Greentech-Cluster in der Steiermark und sind mit der Türkis-Grünen Regierung hier sowieso im internationalen Rampenlicht. Umso wichtiger ist es, dass wir hier sofort in die Gänge kommen und schon im ersten Jahr die zentralen Eckpunkte auf die Straße bringen. Österreich als Culture Tech Hub Österreich als innovative internationale Plattform für die Verschmelzung von Kunst, Kultur, Technologie und der digitalen Welt etablieren (s.49) Stärkung interdisziplinärer Zusammenarbeit zwischen Kultur-, Techszene und Start-ups sowie Universitäten und Forschungseinrichtungen, um nachhaltig unser kulturelles Erbe von morgen zu schaffen <U+21D2> Spannend. Wie wärs mit Startup-Features beim Neujahrskonzert? In jedem Fall ein guter Gedanke, hier eine stärkere Vernetzung zu fördern und die internationale Strahlkraft von Österreich im Kulturbereich mehr zu nützen. Gründer und kleine Unternehmen werden entlastet Das GmbH-Mindeststammkapital auf 10.000 Euro senken. (s.95) Veröffentlichungspflicht in Papierform in der Wiener Zeitung abschaffen (s.92) Ausweitung Gewinnfreibetrag: Investitionserfordernis erst ab einem Gewinn von 100.000 Euro (s.77) Lohnverrechnung vereinfachen (s.92): Strukturelle Vereinfachung der Lohnverrechnung (bessere Koordinierung der einzelnen Player: Finanzamt, Gebietskrankenkasse und Gemeinden) Harmonisierung der Beitrags- und Bemessungsgrundlage so weit als mo¨glich Reduktion der Komplexita¨t und Dokumentationserleichterungen Pru¨fung der Vereinfachung und Reduktion von Ausnahme- und Sonderbestimmungen Verpflichtende Anfu¨hrung der Dienstgeberabgaben am Lohnzettel <U+21D2> Großartig. Auch hier gilt das Motto: It’s all about the (quick) execution! Open Data als Standard Entwicklung einer Umsetzungsstrategie, um das Prinzip Open by Default für nicht personalisierte Daten des Bundes zu etablieren. Ausnahmen zum Schutz von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern sowie unternehmensspezifischen Daten sind zu definieren. (s.322) <U+21D2> Sinnvoll und dringend. Zukunft der Arbeit Breiter gesellschaftlicher Dialog der Bundesregierung unter Einbindung aller relevanten Stakeholder (Sozialpartner, Zivilgesellschaft etc.) über die Zukunft der Arbeit, vor allem der Aspekte Digitalisierung, Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf, Arbeits- und Lebensqualität (s.261) Evaluierung einer Verbesserung der sozialen Absicherung der Gruppe der Selbst- ständigen (ehem. SVA-Versicherte) im Rahmen der Zusammenführung der Träger SVA und SVB zu SVS (s.95) Rechtssicherheit in der Abgrenzung von Selbstständigkeit und Dienstverhältnissen: Der Dienstnehmerbegriff soll im Sozialversicherungs- sowie Steuerrecht vereinheitlicht und klarer umschrieben werden, um Rechtssicherheit zu schaffen. Dabei ist sowohl auf die Privatautonomie (bzw. Entscheidungsfreiheit, „Recht auf Selbstständigkeit“) als auch auf Missbrauchsfälle im Bereich der Scheinselbstständigkeit ein besonderes Augenmerk zu legen. Hierbei sind im Besonderen die Mehrfachversicherung und damit in Zusammenhang stehende Probleme zu evaluieren. (s.95) <U+21D2> Das Thema wird uns noch länger beschäftigen, da unsere Sozialleistungen so stark an Anstellungsverhältnisse gebunden sind, der Trend aber definitiv zu mehr Flexibilität und Selbständigkeit geht. Die Länder, die früh eine Modernisierung der Sozialssysteme schaffen, werden in Zukunft viel besser dastehen. Dementsprechend erfreulich, dass die Bundesregierung hier aktiv den Dialog sucht.","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AS-Stammtisch-66-26-1-300x196.jpg","January 3rd, 2020","de",0.999801576137543,4.24364438913472e-05,0.936371773481369,0.00067810923186092,0.0629076783079654
"https://austrianstartups.com/set-records-straight/","AustrianStartups","Setting the records straight","When I saw the cover of one of Austria’s leading business magazines on the weekend, I was intrigued. With big letters, it read, “Startups are bombarded with grant-millions, traditional SMEs are left in the lurch”. Taking into account that the recent government startup package of €185 million seems minimal in comparison to the more than €19 billion of grants offered by the state of Austria in general, I was wondering whether they knew of any new initiatives. They do not. Instead, the respective story includes several unsatisfied SME founders complaining about the alleged startup love by the government. One of them is actually quoted saying that because of the large amounts of public money, “startup founders don’t know sleepless nights, or how it feels to hit the bottom and get up again”. At that point, I got really irritated. Did he ever make the effort to come by at a startup and experience their reality firsthand before making such comments? He would have found out that no substantial grant is paid out without the founder adding significant private contributions. Every single startup founder would tell him about their personal rollercoaster ride and those sleepless nights. His comment is so far off the mark that it is difficult to take it seriously. Still, I believe that, as a community, we can learn a lot from this article. I am convinced that the increased public awareness about startups is ultimately positive. We desperately need more entrepreneurial spirit and enthusiasm about innovative new technologies in Austria and for that startups need to be present. However, when I read the lines above, it’s clear that this hype has also lead to some misunderstandings. It seems that considerable groups of our society have an unrealistic image of startups. To put it bluntly, in their worldview, startups are a bunch of hipsters playing foosball and living off grant money. Now some of you might say, “let’s not care what people think of us – we will do our thing with or without public support”. But I believe this is not just about keeping political support to further improve conditions for startups – this is also about the talent pool at our hands. We will only be able to attract more of the right people to found or work in startups if the public starts to understand what startups are really about. I believe we currently have a small window of opportunity to position ourselves as an international hub for innovative young companies and I’m not willing to let such misunderstandings get in the way. It will be the job of us, the community, to set the record straight. For that, we need to insert more facts into the public discussion. As already explained above, the startup package is only very small in comparison to the complete grant volume of Austria – considering the wide-ranging positive effects of innovative entrepreneurship (know-how, jobs, and economic competitiveness), probably too small. And yet, many people seem to have the impression that startups are bombarded by public money and everyone else is left behind. To change that, we finally need to get reliable data about our ecosystem and use those findings to educate the public about the realities of Austrian startups and why it makes sense to improve conditions for them. This is our aim with the Think Tank project we are working on – to finally move the basis of these discussions from gut feelings to facts. Last but not least, it will also be our job to help mainstream media outlets portray startups in a more realistic way. People need to understand that founding or working in a startup is not about becoming a millionaire while playing foosball. It is incredibly tough and comes with the ever-present risk of personal failure. But it also enables you to have an impact and grow massively on a personal level. It will be our job to tell the right stories to better communicate that. To quote my fellow AustrianStartups colleague Daniel Cronin, “not just shiny success stories but stories showing how true success is created: grit and determination as well as bloody hard work”.

If no one is paying for it, your product will never fly off the shelves. This month’s Stammtisch was all about customers. Finding them, keeping them and loving them. Actively Pursue Your Customers No customers, no company. Call potential customers and convince them, that your startup is the right fit. Consistency is key, especially in the beginning. Don’t give up and don’t go in unprepared. Stalk them on Facebook if you have to. And be ready to put on your (sales) boots and leave your desk. Networking and talking to people is equally important when it comes to getting the word out and potential feedback in. Customer development is not just about selling your product, it’s learning about the needs of your potential future customers. Don’t be Afraid of your Customers, learn from them! The idea of interacting with potential customers might be scary at the beginning. But especially at the early stages, where you’re probably not going to have a sales team, you’ll have to interact with customers. And those customers will tell you what they don’t like. But that’s a good thing! Get as much (viable) feedback as you can and adapt appropriately. After all, your product is for them. Love Your Customers Closing customers is one thing, but keeping them is a whole other story. Satisfied customers are your long-term goal. Listen to their complaints, find out what their needs are, and always treat them like a valued partner. Dedicated customer support will never go unnoticed. Document Everything and Learn About Your Customers To grow your customer base also means to keep track of what went right and what went wrong when interacting with them. It’s never too early to start with that. Know how you can reach them, what works for them and change your next sales approach accordingly. Different regions, cultures and industries will require different approaches or even different product features. The key to that is documenting every sales related interaction down to every single text message. It may seem tedious but it will be worth it at the end. So that’s how you build and expand your customer basis. Call them, text and stalk them, love them. Present your product consistently; Try, test, learn, document and refine all the time and the customers will follow.

Get as much feedback as you can as early as you can Don’t be afraid of someone stealing your ideas. Share them with people inside and outside of the industry. Listen to what they have to say. Having an extra set of eyes —or five— giving feedback will always benefit you and outweighs the potential risk of someone “stealing” your ideas any day. There are going to be a lot of people with the exact same idea out there anyway. Proper execution is what will set you apart from your competitors, bringing us to the next key requirement when launching a startup. A good team is everything Having a good idea is only half the battle. Turning your idea into a functioning company will require a team that works well together — both personality and skill-wise. Always keep that in mind when recruiting. An impressive CV doesn’t automatically mean great social skills — a key ingredient when it comes to sales staff for example. And don’t neglect your gut feeling when talking to potential future employees. If it doesn’t feel right, it usually won’t work out down the road. Trust yourself but stay realistic Thinking big is what entrepreneurs do. And having a vision of what could be can be great motivation. Commit to your vision. Learn everything you can possibly learn to help realize that vision. But also stay realistic. Know what you and your team can and cannot do. Overestimating one’s own success and capacities is one of the main reasons young startups fail. Ask yourself the right questions Before doing anything else, you should ask yourself some questions: Why do I want to start a company? So why do you? Think about why you want to launch your own startup. Some people tend to think launching a startup is easy money. It’s not. It’s long hours and sleepless nights but it’s something you create and form yourself. It’ll require you to learn and adapt fast to overcome new challenges every day. If that sounds like something you can endure and enjoy, don’t waste any time and go for it. Who do I want to work with? This cannot be stressed enough. Think about what you need from your team. Right now and in the future. And then hire accordingly. Your team members need to have an open mindset, the ability to work with others and need to be able to adapt fast. The right skill set is key. Don’t be afraid to say no to potential applicants. What do I Want to Achieve in the Long run? Think about where you want to go with your idea, what you want to achieve. What could be your potential impact? Don’t overthink, but have a clear vision where you want to go. That’s it for this Stammtisch. Don’t be afraid to launch your own startup, but don’t be stupid about it either. See you at the next Stammtisch.

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-56-how-to-build-a-kickass-founding-team/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #56: How to build a kickass founding team","You’ve got an amazing idea? That’s great, congratulations! But do you also have the team it takes to make this idea successful? Are there specific indicators you should look for in potential co-founders? What about your first employees? And what happens to your own sanity when the company grows? That – and much more – was discussed at Stammtisch #56. Let’s just say, there is no right or wrong here – judging from the heated discussion between Rhina Portillo, Cozyo, Jakob Reiter, TheVentury and Matthias Blazanovic, bikemap. First, there is an idea. A little, tiny idea. You talk about it, dream about what would happen if it became reality. It’s all fun and games until reality strikes in the form of questions asked considering the movement and structure. “Are we really doing this? NOW?” “What are the next steps?” “Who is taking care of X, Y and Z?” The Marriage metaphor Co-founding is comparable to marriage. You will spend an awful lot of time with your co-founder(s). You will very soon share financial issues. You will fly high together and, but also crash together – and hopefully don’t burn – together. As we can read about past founding stories and also have heard at our last Stammtisch. There will be fights to be fought and there will be struggles ahead. But you will also motivate and pick each other up when it is needed. Our lesson learned this time: You should really take time to pick your co-founder wisely, because, as our one and only Daniel Cronin put it: “You don’t marry the first person you meet either, right?” Friends or Strangers? Founding with friends or strangers? Sure, founding with friends is great when everything’s rainbows and butterflies, but can you handle disagreements and fights as well without taking it personal? And do you complement each other? Are there skills needed in the founding team, that none of you have? Here you should choose wisely and rather focus on hard and soft skills incorporated by the person needed than simply personal emotional connection. However, you don’t always have the luxury of being picky (In need of a CTO, anybody?). But you can build a great founding team without even having met in person before incorporating the company – as Jakob Reiter remembers from founding his first company. Skype was a sufficient way to meet and the team has moved on to founding several companies together by now. What it comes down to is one question: Can we go through tough times together as well as the happy ones? Or, as Rhina puts it “Is this a person I would share financial problems with?” Friends or no friends, make sure you have contracts in order from the beginning. “You want to draw the papers up in case worst comes to worst, but then you never want to look at them again – hopefully” as Jakob says. Because of course, everything is exciting and everybody is happy doing this together in the beginning, but sometimes, things happen. And you want to be on the safe side, in case they do. You might not save the friendship but the business. Hacker, Hipster, Hustler Diversity in the founding team is one of the most important things, our panelists agree. “More often than not, you are surrounded by people who all have the same background, but what you actually need are other – complementary – skill sets in your team. And these are hard to find, sometimes”, as Matthias knows from experience. If you want to follow the “Holy Trinity of Founding Teams”, make sure your team consists of a hacker (again, CTO, anybody?), a hipster – somebody who loves the product, takes care of the UX and knows what the user needs – and a hustler – the manager in the team who takes care of the finances and all that great stuff. Easy, right? So, what makes a great co-founder? Great question! Not so easy to answer! After all, judging from the completely different answers we got to this question. Among others, honesty is an important characteristic. Picking somebody with a complimentary skill set to yours is something you should always keep in mind, too. And going with the financial theme: co-found with somebody who thinks about money the same way you do. But with all these rational decisions, don’t forget about a little craziness either: pick somebody who is just as passionate about making the business happen as you are and join in the craziness together.

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-57-how-startups-can-change-the-world-for-the-better/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #57:  How startups can change the world for the better","Tanking place last Tuesday at Impact Hub Vienna, Stammtisch #57 was all about Social Entrepreneurship. Hannah Lux (Vollpension), Frederik Debong (mysugr) and Peter Vandor (WU Vienna) discussed how startups can change the world for better. And let us tell you this, there are many ways they can! Social Entrepreneurs “Why would I found a business if I didn’t have the goal to change the world for better?” Hannah Lux drops a bomb with her first commentary of the night. And shows that social entrepreneurs are intrinsically motivated to follow a strong mission. A mission to have a positive impact on this planet – on a smaller or bigger scale. With this strong mission come tough decisions, though. Well, according to our podium guests, it’s not about “taking the easy way, it’s taking the way with more impact”. Measuring Impact Speaking of taking the road with more impact, the question arises: How do you properly measure impact? In a world of KPI’s and data-driven everything, how can we prove – with numbers – that impact is being made? “There is a whole industry focusing on this topic”, says Peter Vandor. “If I see people from all ages connecting with each other in a natural environment – when I see people blossoming in this environment – I know I have made an impact”, adds Hannah Lux. But is impact the only way to measure success in social businesses? Is the trade-off of being social not being economically successful? Is it just a nice dream of naive people who think they can actually change this planet? A hundred percent not. If anything, running a successful social business is way harder than a common profit-driven company. Because it has to be social AND a business. It has to have an impact while still being economically sound. Mission Drift What happens, though, when the venture gets bigger? When partners are coming on board or the company goes public? That’s the moment it gets harder and harder to prioritize having an impact. Mission drift is – in many cases – bound to happen. As soon as more stakeholders get involved, it’s easy to lose sight of what you set out to do in the first place. The company becomes a balance sheet and it’s all about investors and their return. “To avoid mission drift, you have to work on it from the beginning. Making sure the mission is ingrained in the team”, says Peter Vandor. And even when selling the company to a huge corporate, it’s possible to stay true to your mission, as Frederik and mysugr show: “Before selling, we made sure everything was going to stay the same. To have the same people making decisions. The same team. The same mission. And nobody is contractually forced to stay.” Love it or leave it. What’s left to say is this: It’s on you – don’t say “I wish somebody would make the world a better place”. YOU can make the world a better place. See you all at next month’s Stammtisch – #58, where you can tell us about how YOU want to make the world a better place, and find out how to score an investment at the same time. Shoutout to Hanna, Frederik and Peter for being part of April’s Stammtisch and inspiring us to have an impact!

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-58-private-investors/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #58: Private Investors","Anyone who has thought of creating their own business will stumble upon one major obstacle: funding. “How do I finance my startup?” is a question founders have to ask themselves no matter if they plan to start today, tomorrow or in ten years. While it’s important to consider that many successful startups managed to finance their growth through bootstrapping (only relying on existing resources), there are just as many cases in which more money is needed from the beginning. Especially if there is a race to a market and you need to grow quickly, working with external investors makes sense. One option for getting external financing on board is through a business angel, venture capitalist or other forms of private investment. Don’t wait for the investor to come If you want to get an external investor on board, it’s important not to simply “take money from anybody.” There will be unforeseeable ups and downs that accompany the founding process. So, make sure that the investor by your side is someone you respect and trust. Christoph Schnedlitz, CEO and co-founder of hiMoment recalls, “the first round of investment is the easiest and most difficult at the same time: You have to honestly show what you have to get investment, BUT you also have very little to show”. So, what can you actually put on display? Obviously, you need to show the very little you have in a very grand manner. Christoph says in order to do this convincingly: “You need a storyteller”. Most of the time, business angels don’t take you in before you’ve proven yourself and your business idea. This means, you must have reached a so-called “pre-stage” to actually attract an investor. To use business angel Hansi Hansmann’s words, “this means that you should have proven your business model to yourself for the first 6-12 months”. However, to do so, financial resources are necessary. Here, most recommend to go for the “3 F’s” (= Friends, Family and Fools), but, you might want to look into government grants and programs like “UGP”, as well. Finishing your first round of funding takes 6-8 months on average, according to Christoph. It’s a long process that you will want to have prepared for accordingly. You need deadlines and a, seemingly, never-ending calendar of events and people to talk to. “Know what you do, and who you need to talk to, and please keep careful track of your cap table!“ Hansi’s advice: Calculate how much money you need in the next 12-18 months and then derive the valuation of the company from this. Give away max 15-20% per round, ideally less. Have a viable business plan and know how much funding assistance you need, in addition be able to communicate what you need the assistance for. When you meet these prerequisites, it is time to start looking for investors. Be prepared and keep in mind that “you may need to speak to hundreds of investors before you find the right one for your startup” What they want – the power of FOMO Hansi expects his founders to have at least 3 different pitches very well prepared: one 10-15 second version – just to get attention; another one lasting 2 minutes, and a longer one (5-7 minutes). He stresses that there’s “normally one person in the team, who is the best presenter. So, let him/her rock the stage.” When interviewing for her Fund of Excellence, Natalia Corrales-Diez, goes through a 40-minute assessment with her applicants. This includes going through 750 criteria that calibrate to define a so-called “street fighter”. The assessment includes the participant’s vision, values and his/her “Plan B”. There is one approach Hansi personally advises against: “Don’t ever ask an investor to give you money directly. Just pitch how great what you want to do is. Everybody knows it’s only about money, anyways.” Also, investors are very susceptible to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Investors are quite insecure and don’t want to miss out on the next big thing – use this to your advantage! hiMoment, for example, created a special newsletter to spread the “feeling that there’s really something happening”. They made sure, their marketing channel was FULL of success stories, and even developed their own language by creating a new coaching framework. Christoph says, “you need to find a language to express what it is that you’re trying to sell them and make them like it.” The real asset is you Having a kickass team is not sufficient, though. When it comes to money you need to fulfill certain requirements. Even having a balanced team with experienced founders, operating in big markets with a great product, clear direction and revenue does not automatically make it easy to get money. You also have to get this information to the investor AND make him/her believe in you. For Hansi, it’s a balance of capabilities, a motivated team and at least one entrepreneur who is willing to go through a lot of frustration. In short, be amazing! Christoph’s key to success, for example, lies in selling. He believes in “sales power” – a fire in the eyes and a vision that’s tangible. For Natalia, the decisive factor is clearly individual: “We invest in a person. It’s only about your personality.” Big thanks again to firestarters.space. – an architecturally impressive new co-working space in Vienna – for having us! And, big shout out to our marvelous panel Christoph Schnedlitz (Co-Founder & CEO – hiMoment), Natalia Corrales-Diez (Managing Director – Fund of Excellence), and Hansi Hansmann (Business Angel) for a diverse and thrilling discussion.

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-61-bootstrapping/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #61: Bootstrapping","Bootstrapping. Some call it the holy grail of building a startup, others don’t even know what it means. So before we tell you about all the insights from our Stammtisch #61, let’s take a look at how businessdictionary.com understands bootstrapping: “Building a business out of very little or virtually nothing. Boot strappers rely usually on personal income and savings, sweat equity, lowest possible operating costs, fast inventory turnaround, and a cash-only approach to selling. Many of today’s largest corporations (such as Apple computer, Clorox Co., Coca Cola, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft) began as boot-strapped ventures.” So basically, bootstrapping means taking no outside capital and funding your business solely with your personal finances and your company’s first incomes. Sounds hard? It definitely is. However, there is a lot to it, according to our awesome panelists, Claudia Eder (tubics), Klaus Furtmüller (jobrocker and jobiqo) and Peter Steinberger (PSPDFKit). Why bootstrap? First things first – why should you consider bootstrapping? For many it’s a question of principle – not taking in any outside investment also means not giving away equity – the company stays truly yours. But Bootstrapping also means focusing on what should be at the core of every business – creating value for the customers. Since you need your customers to buy the product or service as soon as possible you’re extremely focused on making something people love and will pay for. Klaus Furthmüller put it like this: “You’ll learn how to make money”. When to bootstrap? As just discussed, one of the big advantages of bootstrapping is that you’re forced to focus on customer needs and development, building a great MVP, building something your customers will love and get value out of. There is no other way since you need to make money and making money depends on whether the customers like your product or not. Claudia calls this the “guiding star of bootstrapping”. In theory, we know that virtually every business should focus on this. But the reality often looks different. When Peter’s previous company scored an investment in the beginning, the team spent an entire year building a product before they started market testing. When not to bootstrap? As everything, bootstrapping has its downsides, too. One of them is that everything relies on you – and your co-founders, if you have some. Most likely, there is no money to hire a team in the beginning, so you have to do everything yourself, even the parts you are not good at or don’t enjoy that much. Additionally, you might not be able to grow as fast as you would like to. As Claudia says “Bootstrapped companies who have scaled without taking any investment have my biggest admiration”. So, after having bootstrapped successfully for a while and having built your first customer base, some might decide to look for an investment. In the end… As always, there is no right or wrong, when starting a startup. But focussing on your customers and getting them to show that they are willing to pay for your product will hardly be a mistake. What kind of learnings did you take away from Stammtisch 61? Do you have any questions? Let us know and we will forward them to our experts from the panel! Thank you all for this great discussion and evening!

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-63-hiring-internationally/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #63: Hiring Internationally","For Stammtisch #63 we discussed hiring internationally – a topic that has many different perspectives that need to be considered and a topic, that plays an important role for startups from the beginning We welcomed Sead Ahmetovic from WeAreDevelopers, Felix Häusler from Grape, Anna Iarotska from Robo Wunderkind and Christoph Bitzner from TheVentury. Why hiring internationally? Hiring internationally in general can have many different reasons. Maybe you want to increase your talent pool, or want to find people with specific technical skills, that are not easy to find in your country. Like Sead said, they see a lack of talent within Austria, especially when it comes to developers. Christoph agrees, “especially growth hackers are not easy to find here”. In his opinion, internationally talent is necessary to have a broader perspective and different opinions that lead a business to success. One of his “Aha” moments at TheVentury was when they hired a prior lawyer- now developer, who approached technical issues in a completely different way, which enabled totally new solutions and the development of new processes. Austria is a small market and in order to scale you need international experience and knowledge. By hiring only people from your country, you’ll keep a specific mindset within the company and therefore might overlook potential strategies and business opportunities in different markets. You need to look “over the Austrian Tellerrand”. International people all have a different cultural background. Culture is a powerful tool to success, that shapes not only working behavior and relationships, but also the enjoyment of work itself. It’s made out of all experiences, backgrounds and skills your employees bring to the table and will influence the environment you’re working in on a daily basis. What does it need to be hired internationally? When a company decides to hire an employee from overseas there are different things to pay attention to. You’re not only looking into technical skill sets of potential candidates. After all, our panel agreed, you can train them on the job and introduce them to company processes. It’s a broader skill set that you’re looking for- highlighted Christoph. At TheVentury potential candidates need to bring the right skill set, culture and passion to the table. Felix thinks that if somebody took the risk and chance to actually go to another country and work abroad, he or she- most of the time- has inevitably a better set of soft skills. “For us it’s not only about knowledge, but about increasing diversity and therefore success.” According to this article, divers teams can help a company to be 35% more likely, to have returns over their industry’s median. Remote or not? There are successful startups and companies out there that work mostly or even completely remotely – indeed there’s a whole database of such startups. Still, our panelists found remote work difficult and rather like their international employees within the country and favourably in the same room. “It’s way easier to coordinate and communicate with each other”, Felix relates, “because at some point it wasn’t possible to schedule any meetings with the whole team- having more than five different time zones to take into account”. This also made it more difficult to keep people. In some areas it’s simply necessary, e.g. product development and sales- they really need to understand the product. Anna, who’s company has offices in Austria and Asia thinks “there should always be someone on the ground”. Christoph found it difficult to build the same connection and relation even though they would stay connected over laptops, video chats etc. over the whole working day. But at WeAreDevelopers Sead realised that once you grow at a certain speed, hiring remote workers becomes more and more necessary. Bigger companies lose a lot of ground/money/projects if they do not manage to find fitting talent quickly enough. Allowing people to live wherever they want and work remotely can enlarge your talent pool dramatically. Challenges along the way of hiring internationally During our panel discussion we noted three big challenges when hiring internationally Language Barriers: According to Anna, Asia and the US are the biggest markets for international potentials, but especially with Chinese people they experienced high language barriers. She recalls that “there were many misunderstandings”. Regulations: This point stood out. All four panelists had, at some points, difficulties with getting people into Austria, or, even more often, keeping them here. All panelists recall difficulties getting so called “Rot-Weiß-Rot Karten” for employees (a working visa for 24 month). Felix said, they basically have a lawyer now to get through the proceedings more quickly, because they already lost an employee. “He had a small family, a wife and a kid. When they finally got the extension of their papers, they already needed to start the process for the next extension. So they decided to leave, because it was just too dangerous for them to have their kid taken from school one day by the police.” Sead also pointed out that a percentage of developers doesn’t even have a degree, therefore they might not even fit the criteria. And Anna added that only for a 10-weeks stay you already need a working permit. Taxes: Both, Anna and Christoph experienced high potentials turning down great job offers, because of high taxes in relation to their home country. In Anna’s case, the guy went back home, saying, he’s not interested in paying that much taxes. In Christoph’s case, the guy stayed, because the company explained and communicated all the taxes and basic insurance terms and their benefits. One positive point that is noteworthy though, is that the EU makes it possible to have access to over 500 million people that don’t need ANY visa! Startups love the EU! How to actually hire them? The experiences and opinions vary at this question. Grape is looking into hiring people from the Ukraine and Brasil, they focus on the youngest generation. The Ventury posts job ads in English. “So, if an international person is already interested, we can catch them.” RoboWunderkind is looking actively at people on LinkedIn and approaches them directly. At WeAreDevelopers it depends on the position you’re looking to fill, but they also rely on active sourcing and use social communities. In order to make international teams work effectively together, there are many different approaches: Structure, goals, rituals (according to Anna) A catchy onboarding process and actively spent time together out of the office, like company events (Christoph) Felix relies on having a special person within the team that new employees can connect to, take them to many events like AustrianStartups Stammtisch and other communities like Metropole Why work in Austria?

"https://austrianstartups.com/stammtisch-76-embracing-failure/","AustrianStartups","Stammtisch #76 Embracing Failure","To start with, why is failing important? Failure is not black and white: although it might hurt, it can also provide valuable insights. Failing is important as a record of your actions: you define the reasons of a failure and you learn from it (e.g. bad luck?, bad decisions?). Entrepreneurship after all is an iteration process. Do not forget that 90% of startups fail, so it’s not very likely to make it right with the first attempt. Of course, there are different ways of failing: you can fail with style, heroically but also in a silly manner. In every case, the worst thing to do is not to reflect on your failure. Reflecting about your mistakes provides new knowledge to you and in this way your failure will eventually become a stepping stone for your future. So why should we talk about failure? Surely, there are cultural parameters that frame failure as a stain in someone’s life – as stigma. However, failure happens to everyone, especially in business. So, here is the number one reason for talking about failure: it happens – we don’t have to hide it under the carpet. Failures are simply part of the game in entrepreneurship, although it is hard to talk about it. We are not proud of our failures therefore talking openly about them is an act of bravery. Failing means moving, not sitting and doing nothing – and via “failing forward” you gain since you are closer to the right approach simply because one wrong path has been crossed out. The generalization of this stance creates a learning culture: people learn from their own but also from other’s mistakes. Failed attempts inform our future decisions. Real effects of failure (non-theoretical) Failure can really hurt. Out of its philosophical or epistemological assessment it can have some very practical implications. It’s quite possible that there will be serious turbulence on a personal level – dreams may be destroyed, professional/financial problems may arise, relations may be damaged, there may be even legal implications. In some cases, even friends and associates may get hurt by your own decisions. Is there life after failure? True, failure is a hateful thing. There are people who really suffered after failures. Part of our cultural system is the “blame game” – some of us point their fingers easily. In the corporate world the situation may be even tougher. On the other hand, people are also understanding and empathizing beings! While others judge, others give support! And don’t forget the public perception of comebacks! Think of Herman Maier in the Austrian context (Herminator)! Failures can become a starting point for admiration! In this direction, don’t take “public judgment” too seriously: think that some judge you for fights that they never gave themselves. Your present wisdom could be an asset concerning investors and a great comeback could even make headlines about you! Are there differences between America and Europe/Austria in the perception of failure? There is a controversy concerning the differences in the reception of entrepreneurial failure between the United States and Europe. One view supports that the American culture is much more open to failure and American entrepreneurs respectively keener in learning from their mistakes in order to make better decisions in the future. This implies that American investors are more enthusiastic in following people that are passionate while Europeans although, better in keeping the risk small, are much more conservative. Another view promotes the similarities in the mentality of the two cultures which include taking a step back, emotional recuperation and reflection before the next step. Entrepreneurial spirit is also present in Europe/Austria. Maybe it is still lacking in tech fields but after all entrepreneurship is not just about technology. What are the main reasons that businesses fail? Rule number one: failure is about us as entrepreneurs. Blaming the customers makes no sense – you will never learn anything out of it. The absence of a market is the primary reason for the failure of a product/business. Other good reasons may be cofounders who are not on the same page or investors who do not have enough trust in the project. The alpha and omega for success is always the team: a good team can make a mediocre idea work, while a bad team can destroy a brilliant idea. 90% of success is doing, not thinking and this is the reason that most startups end up with something different than the initial idea, a fact that demands flexibility. In a nutshell Failures are an amazing source to learn from! Yes, it hurts, yes it may suck at the beginning, but it is part of the learning process so you have to accept it. Draw a line when you have to and embrace your failure (don’t let denial turn you into to a “non-failed zombie”). Don’t try to solve problems that nobody cares for and always pursue your dream with a kick-ass team. If you fail, take the time to reflect on what went wrong and start over again. And most importantly: don’t let anybody stop you!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0108-300x200.jpg","November 26th, 2019","en",0.993529438972473,0.0810166094452143,0.448005810379982,0.0739423744380474,0.39703518897295

Depends on the technology and on the company’s goals If you want to keep your business logic within your company –> keep front-end development internally Outsourcing option mainly for back-end development Outsourcing can be a solution if: You know about the team of the company that provides the service You know what kind of developer you are looking for Outsourcing can be challenging: Language Culture Communication Quality You have to build knowledge before outsourcing!

Are those the typical characteristics of an entrepreneur? Or is there more to the story? That’s what we were determined to find out at last month’s Stammtisch! Are age-diverse teams a thing? Let’s face it, our startup-bubble is filled with the young and hungry. When it comes to age – how diverse is our professional network, really? Then again, do we ever come in touch with people much older than ourselves? If you think about it, there aren’t a lot of chances to hang out with elderly people, other than your family members. So, it’s no surprise that age-diverse startups are rare –at least that’s what one might think. Typically young, typically old… We commonly attribute innovativeness, energy and curiosity, in short, entrepreneurial skills, to the young. Especially when it comes to startups, what do elderly really know? Entrepreneurs these days need to be tech-savvy, quick to adapt, and committed to their business 200% in order to potentially, maybe, eventually be successful. Who do you picture when hearing these keywords? Here’s the plot twist: a study conducted by Joshua Gans, a professor at the University of Toronto, shows that Silicon Valley founders who managed a successful exit are, on average, 47 years old. Imagine that! Valuing each other’s strength! Is it because older people have more experience, a better understanding of people, are more confident and better at sales? Whatever the reason, instead of thinking in stereotypes, it’s more than time to value each other for what we are good at, regardless of age – or anything else, for that matter. A number, the years we’ve lived, doesn’t define how and who we are. It’s all about the mindset. How many young people out there live a narrow-minded, mainstream life, while some older ones are longing to create something new, to make a difference? What would you do? “Would you found with a person significantly older than yourself?” I asked a friend today. “NO, definitely not!” Wow, I thought my friends were more open-minded than that. “I would start a company with somebody regardless of their age. What matters to me is the way they think. If they are up for new challenges, good at what they do and are an asset to the project, I would work with them. And you? What would you do? We are challenging you to go out and actively seek the company of people a good amount older than yourself. You might be surprised – and have stories to tell at our next Stammtisch! See you there!

This month’s Stammtisch focused on identifying and questioning outdated and often sexist business practices within startup and business culture in general. But first, let’s talk about the two important announcements of this Stammtisch. CEO and Editor in Chief of Metropole, Maggie Childs joined the board of AustrianStartups. Chances are you have already seen her at a Stammtisch before. On stage or in the crowd. We’re glad to have this experienced member of the startup community on board. Welcome Maggie! The second one is the newly released Austrian Startup Code of Conduct, which aims at providing a set of rules for a startup environment that has grown tremendously and is attracting a lot of new people. With this the Austrian startup community is taking a clear stand against unethical behavior. So check it out and give your pledge if you want to contribute to a professional and healthy startup environment in Austria. We want your support! That being said, here’s a quick rundown of this month’s Stammtisch topic and highlights. Bro! So why choose this topic and simultaneously release a code of conduct? Recent press coverage about issues at well-known international players of the startup ecosystem, such as Uber or 500 Startups has shown that there is still a lot of room for improvement in our society. Especially diversity and gender wise. And this month’s speakers definitely had their fair share of experiences that support that claim – inside and outside of the startup scene. “I know companies, typical old large-scale Austrian enterprises that have Christmas parties and afterwards everybody goes to the strip club. And it’s completely normal.”, Andreas Klinger from Product Hunt mentioned. “As a woman in a managing position you end up having to meet with people in those positions and they tend to be men. And then you get invited by one of them to a Stammtisch and then they tell you that you can’t come because you’re a girl. I’ve had this said to me three times and they were not even ashamed about it.”, Maggie Childs from Metropole added. And often these things tend to manifest beyond the settings of company-get-togethers. “I see a lot of old male founder teams and they go on to hire more white men and this doesn’t really stop. And when they’re already a team of 20 white men and they start talking about adding diversity to the team or they can’t find a man to fill the position, then they start thinking about hiring a woman. And when you join this team and it’s very alpha male-ish, with a foosball table in the office and “beer drinking Fridays” it’s not going to be a very welcoming environment.”, Floor Drees from sektor5/5starts explained. “I used to work for big corporations in Salzburg before I founded my own company. And we used to call it a Nudelsuppen or sausage fest because the majority of people working there were men.”, Johann Rath from TableConnect recalled. So how can we as a community move towards a diverse and fair working environment? We need to outline the benefits of diversity and speak up about sexism and harassment. When Maggie asked the crowd if they had witnessed sexism at their workplace several hands were raised. But the following question about who spoke up about it was met with a considerably smaller amount of hands. “And that’s what we can do. Talk about it. I think that’s a big step in the right direction. All of you would have made a difference by speaking up.” “Language is also very important. The language you use in your marketing and your external communication in general. It’s a powerful thing and you need to think about what you’re putting out there. And you also need to know how to speak up if you’ve witnessed something. So a collective understanding of how to talk about these issues is also very important.”, Floor added. The right amount of “faking it” Every entrepreneur has probably tweaked the truth a bit to buy more time or gain a slight advantage at some point. But every one of us also probably knows a story about a startup that turned out to be much less than expected. So where’s the line when it comes to “fake it ‘till you make it”? The story of Johann Rath’s TableConnect is an exemplary tale of when “faking it” turns into an actual product. Originally planned as a funny video, Johann and his colleagues uploaded a video of an iPhone connected to a table and turning it into touch-surface. The video went viral, leading to global media coverage. There were plenty of interview and acquisition requests and after rejecting offers for two years for obvious reasons, they decided to actually make TableConnect. Nonetheless, a lot of stories remain where “faking it” a bit too much ended badly for investors and founders alike. So what is ok and what is not when it comes to one of startup cultures most famed platitudes? “There’s a huge difference between faking something and having a vision. If you’re fundraising, you’re raising for something you will build in the end. It might not be there yet but that’s ok. But there is a fine line for sure. Faking it by not doing a life demo but recording it is fine but having a bot vote for your startup at a competition is not.”, said Floor “I know so many landing pages that pretend to be an actual product and pretend to have customers. But as long as it’s not fraud the market will decide. But if you need a little bit of bullshit like smart wording, why not?”, Andreas noted. So what should you take away from this month’s Stammtisch? Obviously, that we’re living in the 21st century. Be mindful of how your work environment is developing, celebrate diversity and equality, openly communicate about these things and most importantly, speak up about harassment and toxic behavior in your workplace. Oh, and don’t overdo the whole “faking thing”. Nobody likes fraud. See you at the next Stammtisch!

Die Corona-Krise trifft O¨sterreichs Wirtschaft hart. Auch Startups spu¨ren die Auswirkungen der Krise bereits unmittelbar: Umsa¨tze brechen ein, Gescha¨ftsmodelle funktionieren nicht mehr, laufende Fixkosten ko¨nnen nicht getragen werden und geplante Finanzierungsrunden werden in den na¨chsten Monaten nur schwer realisierbar sein. Ohne entsprechende Maßnahmen zur Unterstu¨tzung des o¨sterreichischen Startup O¨kosystems, drohen sowohl Jobs als auch bereits investiertes o¨ffentliches und privates Kapital verloren zu gehen. Eine Entwicklung die dem Standort nachhaltig schaden würde, da Startups essentielle Treiber von Innovation und Digitalisierung sind und eine Vielzahl von Arbeitspla¨tzen schaffen. Die bereits initiierten Instrumente der Bundesregierung stellen fu¨r viele Unternehmen eine u¨berlebenswichtige Unterstu¨tzung dar. Wie unsere vor kurzem veröffentlichte Umfrage zeigt, helfen die bisher vorgestellten Maßnahmen im Fall von Startups allerdings nur sehr bedingt: Nur 35% der Startups planen Kurzarbeit in Anspruch zu nehmen, 30% eine Stundung von Steuern & Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen. Fast die Hälfte der Startups erachten Überbrückungsgarantien (46%) und den Härtefallfonds (47%) für sich als ungeeignet, da notwendige Voraussetzungen nicht erfüllt werden können. Gleichzeitig sehen sich 85% der Startups direkt von der Krise betroffen und stehen vor allem vor einem zentralen Problem: Der kurzfristigen Liquidita¨tssicherung. Deshalb mu¨ssen genau hier die spezifischen Unterstu¨tzungsmaßnahmen ansetzen. Dazu hat O¨sterreichs Startup Community hat in den vergangenen Tagen die Kra¨fte mobilisiert: Aus den Ideen von dutzenden Gru¨nder*innen, Investor*innen und Stakeholder*innen sind zahlreiche Empfehlungen entstanden, die jetzt in einem Papier gebündelt wurden.

Acht von zehn Startups leiden unter den Folgen der aktuellen Lage und nur 58% sind derzeit optimistisch, die Krise zu überleben. Größtes Problem sind Liquiditätsengpässe, die durch massive Umsatzeinbrüche und das schwierige Fundraising-Umfeld entstehen. Rund ein Drittel der Startups rechnet folglich damit, Stellen abbauen zu müssen oder hat dies bereits getan. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich auch die innovative Kraft der Startups – fast die Hälfte arbeitet derzeit proaktiv an der Entwicklung von Lösungen gegen die Coronakrise. Startups sind anders. Die Umfrage zeigt auch, dass die bisher umgesetzten Hilfsmaßnahmen der Bundesregierung den Startups nur bedingt helfen. So planen derzeit nur 35% der Startups Kurzarbeit in Anspruch zu nehmen, 30% eine Stundung von Steuern & Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen, 24% den Härtefallfonds und 23% Überbrückungskredite. Fast die Hälfte der Startups sehen sich für Überbrückungsgarantien (46%) und Härtefallfonds (47%) als ungeeignet an – oftmals weil sie die notwendigen Kriterien nicht erfüllen.

Unsere Vorschläge dafür haben wir hier gesammelt. Die wichtigsten Fakten. 85% der teilnehmenden Startups leiden unter den Folgen der aktuellen Krise. 41% der Startups schätzen ihre derzeitige Lage als schlecht oder sogar kritisch ein – das ist ein Anstieg von rund 450% im Vergleich zur letzten Umfrage des Austrian Startup Monitors im Sommer 2019 (9%). 71% der Startup-Gründer schätzen das derzeitige Fundraising-Umfeld als schlecht oder kritisch ein. 42% der Startups haben dadurch große Probleme.

"https://austrianstartups.com/summary-visions-startups-austria/","AustrianStartups","A summary of “Visions for Startups in Austria”","With our paper “Visions for Startups in Austria”, we are suggesting five main key aspects we see as necessary to turn Austria into an innovation-driven economy of the 21st century by leveraging todays main catalyst of innovation and growth: startups. If we do not develop the right ecosystem in Austria to be a “magnet” for (very mobile) talents and startups, the consequence is that the existing ones leave to countries with better suited conditions or their ambitions. Thus we release the Executive Summary (PDF, 1 MB) and the Full Version (PDF, 2MB) in German. Following a summary in English There are 3 inevitable trends of the 21st century so far that are shaping the global economy with the potential to shake things up: A digitalization of the global economy, faster innovation cycles, and the global rise of young, ambitious talent. Startups are both a consequence and an accelerating catalyst of these trends. For Austria, it is therefore absolutely vital to have a flourishing startup ecosystem. The following 5 key facts need to be addressed to build a better foundation for that ecosystem: Future-oriented Education Education is the basis for a societal change in terms of knowledge-based evolution and development. We therefore think that making education future-ortiented is a vital factor for becoming a nation of entrepreneurs and knowledge-society. By modernizing our education system, we can support the most important factor of startups: talended, ambistious young people. We suggest introducing IT education starting from primary school; practical entrepreneurship education starting from secondary school; and introducing a founder initiative and “founders garages” at higher education instutions. Improvement of the overall Environment for Founders Various laws and institutional aspects in Austria are based on firms as they existed decades ago. Modern companies and startups have other requirements. Our aim is to make it simpler and easier for entrepreneurs to found, grow and move their startups in/to Austria. We suggest the introduction of a simple employee participation model for private limited companies; the adaptation of the new foundation promotion (Neugründungsförderung) and business start program (Unternehmensgründungsprogramm); extension of structural subsidies for startup ecosystem; modernization of the commercial code (Gewerbeordnung); support of flagship tech & entrepreneurship events; adaptation of the red-white-red card (immigration card for skilled employees) for startups. Mobilization of Capital from Private Investors Austria has an enormous demand (and unfortunately currently a big lack) when it comes to private venture and business angel capital. We missed the opportunity in the past few decades to encourage and properly incentivize private invstors to invest into local companies and startups. We therefore think that the following measures can effectively adress this problem: creation of tax incentives for Austrian private investors; creation of a fund-of-fund model with state Cornerstone Investment in privately managed funds; “unleashing” crowdfunding and cowdinvesting through suitable regulation; Creating incentives for (Austrian) institutional investors to invest in startups; provision of resources for networking and fundraising activities with international investors Future-oriented Public Grants We do have a wide-spread variety of public grants and government support schemes and various of these programmes were established within the past few years. Its good to have them and important for startups. Their current “modus operandi”, however, is not well suited for startups. Therefore we suggest: reallocation of funding to innovative start-ups and R & D; expansion of smaller, faster public grants that are easier to apply; gradual harmonization of the funding application structure; no longer prefering projects which have cooperations with scientific institutions; more tolerance for adapting the project focus during the project period; make the funding and financing chain more predictable Political Awareness for Entrepreneurship The topics of startups and hi-tech companies get much higher attention from politics in other countries. We need a stronger anchoring of the topics within the Austrian political system to improve changes in the ecosystem. Therefore we suggest: introducing a “Founder and Startup Commisioner” within the government; the topics Innovative young companies and startups should be high on the agenda of top politicians WE ALL ARE AUSTRIANSTARTUPS!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/austrianstartups_vision-300x169.jpg","November 27th, 2013","en",0.991450726985931,0.0516388259857194,0.622814252972603,0.295880039600888,0.0296669360250235

It started as a small grassroots non-profit initiative to make startups more visible in Austria and to help build an ecosystem to help them thrive. Since then, it has been one hell of a ride. Today, more than 30,000 social media followers, roughly 1,000 members and more than 50 partners make up our underlying support network. We have reached up to 160,000 monthly unique viewers on our communication channels, organized events for more than 10,000 participants in total and had an impact on several new government initiatives for startups by voicing the needs of the community. Since 2013, the Austrian startup ecosystem has evolved significantly and AustrianStartups as a living organization has evolved as well, trying to fill holes and implement suggestions from the community. As a result, if you ask five people what AustrianStartups does, you’ll probably get five completely different answers. So, to set the record straight, here is what AustrianStartups is planning for the future. Our vision for the future In 2018 we aim to regain focus and bring AustrianStartups to the next level, ready to take on the challenges of the years to come. It all starts with a belief we all share and have experienced first hand: Entrepreneurial thinking and acting are key for positive change. No matter if its a young entrepreneur, who wants to revive local bookstores in Vienna, a group of people who organize a non-profit job fair for refugees in Austria, or a few Ph.D. students launching a university spinoff working on a cure for specific cancer types. The more people feel empowered to develop solutions to problems instead of complaining about them, the better off society will be. In EU rankings, Austria has yet to reach competitive levels when it comes to entrepreneurial education and conditions. Our goal is to change this dramatically. In fact, our grand vision for the future is that entrepreneurship will be as common as skiing in Austria. This starts with nationwide skiing courses in schools and leads to Marcel Hirscher & Anna Veith tearing up the slopes in the Olympics. The role of AustrianStartups Ambitious goals need a team of collaborative players to make significant, sustainable change in a culture. We know we’re not alone in our efforts, but we believe we can play an important role. As an independent non-profit platform, we focus on three realms of influence: Inspire. Connect. Change. Inspire First of all, we aim to motivate people to develop solutions for problems themselves and provide them with valuable information on how to get off the ground. We want to help people get a realistic understanding of what it means to start your own business or initiate an innovative project: hard work, high impact, and a steep learning curve, but also that it doesn’t mean making fast cash. Our goal is to expand beyond our current community and create content that inspires the broader public and speaks to all generations. Connect Secondly, we strive to connect founders, supporters, entrepreneurial minds and policy-makers and enable exchange between them. This includes our various existing event series (Stammtisch, Office Hours, Stakeholder Roundtables & Vertical Uncovered) and will be expanded in the upcoming months. Change Third, we aim to research and analyse how Austria’s environment can change to give founders & entrepreneurial minds a greater chance for success. As an independent think tank that studies entrepreneurship and builds expertise around it, we will provide policymakers with comprehensive insights that have the power to trigger change. *What AustrianStartups is NOT: A special interest group (“Interessenvertretung”) or lobby organization for startups. We believe there are already plenty of special interest groups in Austria. We see a broad horizon for improvement, reaching beyond the direct needs and viewpoints of startups themselves. An association of startups (“Startup-Verband”). We are an open platform and welcome everyone who shares our vision to join us as a member or to join the team as a volunteer. This includes many startup founders, but also various other innovative minds. A platform that is affiliated/associated with any political party or political movement. We have always been and will always be politically neutral. New Look Our future vision comes with a fresh brand – starting with our logo. We wanted to stay true to our roots, but also signal a new beginning. Without any further ado, meet the new look of AustrianStartups: What’s next The first big project to launch us into this new era is already underway. In order to analyze current problems and identify potential solutions, we need much better, more comprehensive data. This is why we joined forces with several major institutions to create the Austrian Startup Monitor. Check it out here and (if you are a startup founder/manager) help Austria serve you better by taking 20 minutes to complete the survey!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Team-300x200.jpeg","March 20th, 2018","en",0.994394063949585,0.00045483040594263,0.638651311397552,0.000730549276340753,0.360163345932961

So in September, five startups won the chance to present their business concepts in front of 50 business angels. Kokoro The bigger the employee base the more complicated internal processes become. Kokoro focuses on the human side of that equation by aiming to improve the quality of life of employees and reduce staff fluctuation. The app collects and measures emotional data and turns it into Key Emotional Indicators to support and improve internal decision making within companies. Medworker If you’re a doctor or at least know a doctor, chances are you’ve heard an excessive amount of complaints about paperwork and the slow speed of bureaucratic processes accompanying said paperwork. Gathering, exchanging and organizing data can be hard when stacks of paper start piling up, so Medworker developed an app to connect multiple medical teams and retailers of medical equipment and make tedious paper communication a thing of the past. Image Biopsy Lab Although most medical staff considers diagnosing radiographs to be a simple standard procedure, the possibility of human error will always remain. Image Biopsy Lab created an A.I to automated this process and reduce the chance of false diagnoses. Just plug in your laptop, upload your radiographic images, let the robot do the rest and save some time while you’re doing it. No physicians needed. SpinaCare Ever experienced back pain during work? SpinaCare wants to change that by introducing a massage board designed for the workplace to reduce potential back problems. Just lean into it during one of your breaks, relax a little and do something good for your back – which is probably not in the best shape anyway. Abios Abios is an algorithmic biodata system that aims to improve psycho-psychic diagnostics. In layman’s terms: Abios can track your physical activity and personal sleep behavior which makes it useful in all kinds of different areas. Be it diagnostics, professional sports or just getting healthy and in shape. So no matter if you’re a professional athlete, sports enthusiast, a coach or a personal trainer, you should check Abios out. So these are the five startups that got a chance to pitch their concepts to over 50 business angels. Our next topic will be “Fintech Uncovered”. If your startup fits the bill and you’re looking for an opportunity to pitch your very own idea to a room full of people, who could take your startup to the next level, you should not miss out on this one!","https://austrianstartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vertical_Uncovered_aaia-820x461-300x169.jpg","September 20th, 2017","en",0.992873847484589,0.0020091556943953,0.677582681179047,0.00066293851705268,0.31974521279335

Our ambition with this project is first to let politicians know what startups need. Second to raise awareness for startups in this country, in order to highlight the importance and emphasize on what lasting impact startups could have in Austria, provided with the best conditions needed for a vibrant ecosystem (venture capital, taxes, subsidies, social insurance, regulations, etc). As by now, we handed over the paper to every political party in the Austrian parliament in the past few weeks and had good talks about their ambition to help us working on a more startup-friendly ecosystem in Austria. The joint handover to Minister Bures and Christoph Matznetter from SPÖ (Credit: Lucia Vilsecker) Harald Mahrer from Julius Raab Stiftung, an ÖVP thinkthank, accepted the paper Werner Kogler from the Green party at the paper handover (Credit: Lucia Vilsecker) Matthias Strolz and Niko Alm from the NEOS party accepted the paper Kathrin Nachbaur from Team Stronach accepted the paper Mr. Schellenbacher from the FPÖ at the Parliament’s Säulenhalle The idea of providing politicians with insights what startups really need was brought to our attention in May by several stakeholders and startups. AustrianStartups decided to gather the relevant data in cooperation with Pioneers and SpeedInvest and we started a joint Austrian-wide startup survey (from which SpeedInvest created the Austrian Startup Report 2013, an overview of the status quo in the startup ecosystem). Based on the results of this survey, the input of many stakeholders and productive meetings with all political parties we produced a paper to improve the startup scene in Austria. In July, August and September we gathered the startup scene in Vienna at our “Stammtisch” events to talk directly to politicians from various about their specific needs. Couple of weeks later, we had the first draft, which summed up the details for the final paper. Today (26th Nov 2013), this final paper was presented at a press conference together with the Austrian Startup Report 2013. The paper does not represent “demands” and can rather be seen as working paper to be used as broad yet detailed input for the most important areas that concern startups in Austria. It will be publicly available to everyone (startups, stakeholders, media and public), in order to spread the word and involve the whole community in making Austria a better place for startups! Our ambition with the release of this document is to help all Austrian startups to work in a more startup-friendly environment – now and in the future, because we believe Austria has to make the transition to a highly innovation-driven economy in the digitalized world of the 21st century. And startups are an important catalyst of this transistion. WE ALL ARE AUSTRIANSTARTUPS!

"https://austrianstartups.com/welcome-adrian-michael-farewell-can-daniel/","AustrianStartups","Welcome Adrian & Michael / Farewell Can & Daniel","Meet the New Board Members Adrian Zettl-Singh AustrianStartups & me I feel right at home at AustrianStartups. In fact, I’ve been a part of the AustrianStartups family since 2014, when I joined as part of the first official volunteer intake to manage and grow the social media presence. These past years have been a crazy, wonderful ride for me (personally and professionally), for AustrianStartups, and for the whole Austrian startup ecosystem. When I started out in the field, there were about 50 people in Austria who could be considered startup folk, so newcomers got to know the veterans rather quickly. In this small but growing ecosystem, the untamable spirit and support of this community helped my partners and me start and grow our company, TheVentury, to support innovators with key services in innovation management, data and software engineering, as well as growth marketing. We created the accelerator program ELEVATE for machine learning and AI startups from around the world, which enabled us to start building a portfolio of startup investments. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with and learn from some of the most ambitious and successful entrepreneurs and innovators in Austria and beyond. Today the situation in the startup scene has evolved, with all sorts of motivated players and innovators contributing to a thriving ecosystem. I like to think that I’ve grown as an entrepreneur and as a human, alongside this amazing community. And AustrianStartups was a key factor in my journey. Since AustrianStartups has provided me with endless insights and access, I’m honored to be able to contribute as a member of the board and hopefully give back of, to both the community and AustrianStartups as an organization. Big shoes & big plans When Can asked me to take over for him on the board I was hesitant. Firstly, because the shoes of this veteran startupper seemed too big to fill, but then the excitement kicked in. The challenge was just too intriguing to say no to. Thank you Can for all the inspirational talks and the trust you’ve placed in me! I can’t wait to tackle the big plans and challenges ahead! Execution is everything & education is the key I believe that execution is everything in innovation, and in order to execute well on your ideas, you need to develop the right skills and know-how. Ever since I began my startup journey, I’ve been able to spread the knowledge I gained by teaching entrepreneurship, digital business, growth hacking and digital marketing at various universities and programs. Playing a small part in enabling budding entrepreneurs to achieve their goals faster and more sustainably has been one of the most satisfying experiences of my career to date. I look forward to discovering what we as AustrianStartups can do to get skills and know-how out there, so that as many people as possible can feel equipped to at least consider the possibility of founding a company and following through with their ideas. Entrepreneurship the Austrian & European way I believe “entrepreneurship done right” is one of the most efficient ways to make a positive impact on society, and the Austrian and European perspective has a lot to offer when it comes to “doing it right.” Entrepreneurial innovation is particularly essential in times of climate crisis and accelerated socio-economic changes around the world. For years, we’ve been looking to Silicon Valley for innovation and the methods of bringing it about. We’ve learned a lot, but it’s time to confidently combine these learnings with our own DNA in a European context. I believe this combination will result in an efficient, sustainable and responsible approach to entrepreneurship, technology and innovation, leading to our own unique success factors. I’m particularly interested in how to best apply hypothesis-driven innovation methods (you know, all that lean startup and growth hacking stuff) to any situation and at any scale – individual, community, startup, corporate, government, anywhere really – with the goal of sustainable and responsible innovation and development.I’m excited to explore all this, and more, with AustrianStartups, and other stakeholders. Essentially whoever wants to talk about it <U+0001F642> Find me here. Michael Ionita History My affiliation to AustrianStartups began when startups were still to be a rare beast in Austria. Back in 2011, there were only a few individuals around with the courage to step forth into the startup jungle. For most other people in business, we startup folk, were regarded as business punks. Within the sphere of the Austrian mentality, this meant that our chances of success were deemed small to non-existent. To them, it almost seemed that we were attempting to take a shortcut to success. Nothing, however, could have been further from the truth. My RealLifeConnect Co-founder Jürgen Höbarth lay the groundwork for AustrianStartups, by building a Facebook fan page and growing it’s Likes to an impressive and respectable size. Back then, there were many and varied funky ways to doing so quickly. Jürgen however, moved to Hong Kong to expand the RealLifeConnect business overseas but didn’t want to leave the AustrianStartups community unattended so he decided to invite Vlad Gozman to be page admin and the rest is history as told in a previous blogpost. Thus, it began, and the association AustrianStartups was born. Now, nine years later, I was asked to join the board. Naturally, I said “yes!” <U+0001F642> Tick tock Here’s what makes me tick: I believe that we are living in the best ever time to pursue our (business) dreams. I believe that delivering value to people is the only way to create a sustainable business and I believe that things that are worth something don’t come easy! “Solving problems” is the essence of why we are here. I know that some of us crave to solve problems on a larger scale, at which point we need help, a team, a company or a community. AustrianStartups sets the stage on so many levels. It provides a stage on which we can express what we believe in, and build something to prove it. Most of all, AustrianStartups shapes the political landscape in startups’ favor, a priceless contribution. I look forward to using my role at AustrianStartups as an opportunity to give something back. What do you believe in? Come to the next AustrianStartups “Stammtisch” and share your thoughts and passion with us. My current focus At the moment, my main topic is “building successful tech & product teams”. I’m helping companies to build teams from the ground up, or re-build them after a tough period. This involves having a creative atmosphere, workflows, common beliefs and a vision to work towards. At AustrianStartups, I stand for technological progress and a numbers-driven approach, in order to innovate for you and measure our success. My background is technical, I started out earning a living by developing websites and apps back in 2004. Soon I discovered the Startup world with my Startup called RealLifeConnect – it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. After that I built a tech team practically from scratch for Mobfox, a $40M revenue company in the advertising industry. Now I’m helping Walls.io in building a tech team and growing the product. What I’m Passionate About? I’m passionate about all things tech and finding solutions that solve people’s problems at scale. I also have a thing for numbers – not in the traditional sense, which would require you to be a math genius to even grasp it – but in the sense that numbers are at the core of everything I do. Numbers guide my decision making, so I can rely on them more than on my gut feelings. I’m an avid golfer. I only started about eighteen months ago and am still far from awesome at it but I can hold my own in a round of business golf when needed. <U+0001F609> I have also been a Cuban Salsa dancer for 16 years, and you can find me at various Latino venues in the evenings. My most recent passion is helping AustrianStartups reach a position of sustainable growth, so that we can serve you even better. I aim to succeed with my fellow board members and our passionate team of volunteers, without whom we couldn’t function. Thanks for the trust you’ve placed in me. Let’s rock this ???????? Farewell Words Can Ertugrul A day in September… It was September 2013, a few weeks before the federal elections, and looking back, we had no clue what we were doing. That’s abundantly clear from a picture we took that day at our workspace on Spengergasse: Christoph Jeschke and I are both wearing blazers, not hoodies. We wanted to look serious. AustrianStartups was an unknown, newly-born initiative, and there we were sitting alongside Oliver Holle in front of a bunch of journalists. As a veteran, Oliver kept his cool. It was Christoph and my first-ever press conference. The stakes were high and I still remember how nervous we both were, amplified by the lack of sleep due to finishing and printing our “VisionsPapier” just in time. I don’t know what the bigger relief was back then, the press conference finally coming to an end or, over the next few days seeing that it did, in fact, lead to a big spark of public attention. That spark was crucial and the timing was just right. We did it! But who were we? I attended a wedding a few months ago, where the father of the bride said in his eloquent speech “Behind every person, there is another person.” So true. As Christoph and I sat at that table, there were many other people “sitting behind us”. Among them, and as part of the first board, were Adiam Emnay, Daniel Cronin, Vlad Gozman, and Patrick Manhardt. Behind the initial six of us, there were countless supporters and friends who helped us get started. The backbone of the initiative was made up of a community of hundreds who participated in our first survey, which was the foundation of the vision paper and press conference. Without the community’s involvement there would be no survey, no paper, no press conference, no initial spark, no AustrianStartups as we know it. The same can be said for every single thing that AustrianStartups has achieved as an organization: We’ve always been by the community, for the community. “We all are AustrianStartups” was our first slogan but it was so much more. Without the incredible, sometimes invisible work and dedication of the team, local representatives, supporters, partners, advisors, entrepreneurs and stakeholders, AustrianStartups could not have become what it is today. A heartfelt thank you to every one of you. You know who you are. Impact and growth, both mean change Looking at all the team members past and present, their shared values of curiosity and open-mindedness, their unshakable spirit, and their support for each other, makes me feel truly proud. Proud that I have been part of an organization that attracted so many bright and purpose-driven individuals who co-created a collaborative, engaging, and inclusive organizational culture. An organization set out to positively impact the ecosystem it is a part of, and at the same time one that, at its core, promotes professional and personal growth in everyone who is part of it. Impact and growth both mean change. And to be part of a change, we ourselves must change. I believe that is just as true for individuals as it is for organizations… and consequently also for their board members. It is from that perspective that I personally could not be happier that Adrian, who was among the first volunteers at AS, said yes to take my place on the board. For many years he has been the backbone of the AustrianStartups social media team, which he built from scratch. If getting to that first press conference was a sprint to create the needed spark in traditional media, Adrian and his team’s efforts were a marathon to build the organization’s content engine on digital media. That became part of the foundation of what AustrianStartups is today. With his upbeat personality alongside his exemplary and supportive leadership style, Adrian has become a valued colleague in the AustrianStartups team. In addition, with his long-lasting dedication for the startup community, as well as his valuable experience as an entrepreneur, he is the best successor I could have wished for. Thank you Adrian for years of great work and your contribution so far! I am equally excited about Michael joining the board and I want to express my gratitude to both of you for taking on this responsibility for years to come. I wish you two and the whole team an exciting continuation of the journey… You all are AustrianStartups. Daniel Horak Start with “why”?! As some of you might know, I started my first company, Spoken Language System (we developed virtual assistants, aka chatbots) almost 13 years ago. Back then, I was 20 years old and had no clue about startups or starting a company. In 2007, there was nothing even resembling a startup scene in Vienna, so connecting with other founders, sharing knowledge, getting feedback (much less funding) was a real challenge. We tried to grow for several years and got a small amount of public funding, but in the end, we failed and my cofounder and I decided to go our separate ways. After a few years in the corporate and consulting world, I made my way back into the startup world in 2012, starting Crowdinvesting platform CONDA with my co-founder Paul Pöltner Our aim was to change the way startups get funding in Austria. My past startup (failure) experience was a strong driver for launching CONDA, so when Daniel Cronin approached me in 2014 – we met a few years before at the second batch of the hackathon-style startup competition StartupLive and the first season of “2 minutes 2 million” on PULS 4 – and asked if I wanted to join the board of Austrian Startups, I immediately said “yes.” For me, this signified another missing puzzle piece in the burgeoning startup scene in Austria, and I was eager to be of help and foster positive change. The startup rollercoaster Running and growing my own startup and being part of AustrianStartups wasn’t always easy because both meant a lot to me and both “babies” brought with them countless ups and downs. Nevertheless, looking back on the past few years being part of AustrianStartups, working with so many great and smart people from different countries, achieving so many great things together – I couldn’t be prouder and more thankful. Six years ago I couldn’t have imagined how many great experiences I would make and what role AustrianStartups would play in the Austrian economy. Still, it’s just a beginning. As long as starting a company is a foreign concept for most of the population and children don’t learn about entrepreneurship in school there is still a lot to do. Let’s make change before we get changed Running CONDA now for over seven years has taught me a very important lesson: During the lifecycle of a startup, the founder(s) need to adapt to various roles – the company and its structure changes so the founders have to do so too. Another thing I’ve learned is that you should always be one step ahead and proactive, not passive – you need to embrace change. For me, AustrianStartups is also continuously changing because the ecosystem, the people and the technology changes. It was always important to me to try to go where we see a gap – to go where nobody else was going. We aimed to create new things, connect the dots and not by simply doing more of the same. That’s the reason why, some time ago, we started a process of change within the board and I am proud that we were able to convince Maggie Childs and (later) Katharina Unger as well to join us. And now it is time for the next step, which means that I will trustfully handover my board duties to Michael Ionita-Ganea. I am excited about the fresh ideas and perspectives that Michael is going to bring to AustrianStartups. AustrianStartups 4ever So it is time for me to say goodbye and a big thank you to each and everyone who was part of and supported AustrianStartups over the last six years. I loved the work we managed to get done and I can’t wait to see what the next years will bring. I won’t be totally gone, as I’ll be joining the advisory board and will always stay deeply connected to AustrianStartups. I wish all of you the best for the future and rock it!

"https://austrianstartups.com/what-can-startups-learn-from-darwin/","AustrianStartups","What can startups learn from Darwin?"," Entrepreneurship and science are often considered to be very distant relatives. While scientists discover the secrets of nature, entrepreneurs work on uncovering new opportunities to improve our daily lives. Still there are some common approaches that both entrepreneurs and scientists take to create innovations, such as experimentation. Whether you are studying the effect of chemical compounds on a virus or choosing the best advertising platform for your product – only experiments will give you a definite answer. A marketing team analysing the results from A/B tests to select the best background colour for their e-commerce platform uses quite similar statistical approaches as scientists. If we further compare scientific and entrepreneurial approaches to tackle a problem, we will find even more similarities. To make things spicier, let’s move away from the flickering monitors of the twenty-first century and explore what we can learn from the renowned scientist of the 19th century, the father of evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin. 1. Perfectionism is your enemy Competition is the best medicine against perfectionism. Charles Darwin was prompted to publish his groundbreaking book On the Origin of Species because of the threat of being scooped by another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace. Although Darwin was not satisfied with the quality of the early draft of On the Origin of Species, his minimal viable product, or MVP, this manuscript has become one of the most influential scientific books in the history of humankind. The early release of MVP is emphasized in the iconic book The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, who defines it as “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”1. The earlier you get feedback on your product, the more resources and time you have to improve it. 2. Ideas come first, details – last The theory of evolution developed by Charles Darwin has become an Ariadne’s thread for all branches of biology. It has created a general structure of the tree of life explaining how different species originated and evolved. Today it doesn’t matter if you are studying tiny molecules or giant elephants – evolution is the main guiding principle behind any biological discipline. Startups also use a general framework regardless of the industries they are operating in. Entrepreneurs start with ideation and creating prototypes. A process of trial and errors help startups to learn about customer needs and adapt to new challenges. Experimentation is a key to this growth process2. 3. Collect data before you jump to conclusions Charles Darwin spent almost five years as a naturalist on the ship “Beagle” travelling around the world. He collected evidence of different geological periods that our planet lived through in the past, dug up fossils of giant ground sloth in South America and documented data on the diversity and evolution of finches at Galapagos Islands. Darwin brought home fifteen notebooks from his journey filled with pictures and observations that played a crucial role in shaping his view of evolution. It took him almost two decades to explore these data systematically and turn the collection of facts into the fully formed theory3. In the modern world in which we are saturated with information the ability to extract and organise essential facts is a valuable skill. Since data is a fuel for growth hacking, companies that routinely analyse customer’s behaviour and use this information to adjust their products or services demonstrate sustainable growth in sales and attract new customers 4,5. 4. Your failures might be the seeds of your success Charles Darwin was definitely not the best student. In fact, he even dropped out of medical school at Edinburgh University. His father, a renown medical doctor, once told Charles: ”You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.” Well, Darwin turned his early passion for “rat-cathing” into his profession and became one of the most prominent scientists in the history of humankind. A great example of turning failure into commercial success which can be found in the world of product design is the humble Post-it. The small sticky paper that can be easily glued to your notes and torn off multiple times is wildly popular around the world. Post-it notes are produced and sold in colossal quantities – over 50 billion units per year. This product was originally developed based on a weak glue invented in 1968 by Dr Spencer Silver, a scientist from American company 3M. Actually, Dr Silver was aiming to develop a super-strong glue. Despite his best efforts, Silver’s glue was very weak. On the bright side – this weak glue was pressure-sensitive and reusable. Most people were unconvinced by a glue that did not stick properly, but Art Fry, a colleague of Dr Silver, came up with the bright idea of using it for reusable sticking paper. And so the Post-it was born, a product which is now sold in over 100 countries worldwide7,8. 5. Think big! Not only did Darwin found the new science – evolutionary biology – but he has also transformed our outlook on the world. The theory of evolution had a lasting impact on various components of our civilization including art, philosophy and politics. Radical innovations have profound effects on our lives. The most successful entrepreneurs are not the ones who sell the most, but the ones who transform industries. Big-picture thinking helps to achieve intermediate goals and communicate key messages to the general public. Would you be more interested to read an article about a company which develops novel rockets or about a company with ambitions to colonize Mars? Ask Elon Musk about it. Scientists and entrepreneurs know that there is no easy path to innovations. They have learned the hard way that experimenting, analysing data, fighting perfectionism, failing and starting over is the only viable approach to succeed in expanding our knowledge about the world and advancing our society. Probably the goals and approaches of science and entrepreneurship are not that different, after all? References: 1. Eric Ries, Minimum Viable Product: a guide.

It is an open place for all startups, stakeholders, and interested people, who are all encouraged to launch joint initiatives with us. The importance of visibility Some might argue that the startup scene in Austria isn’t that big. We are convinced, however, that it is rapidly growing and has a lot of great people who are pursuing great projects and initiatives for the community, as well as great startups in the community. This “community”, however, is difficult to grasp at times, for insiders and outsiders alike. The local Viennese startup scene does not really know what is happening in Tyrol, the different players in Styria might learn something from the experiences of the community in Upper Austria, and so on. Besides that, new entrepreneurs sometimes don’t know where investors or incubators are, investors sometimes don’t know about exiting startups and entrepreneurs sometimes don’t know about people who could act as a mentor to them. AustrianStartups wants to provide exactly this kind of visibility. Bringing everyone on one table There are shared interests but yet little coordination within “the community”… a shared initiative seems to be missing, that could leverage synergies. AustrianStartups is trying to fill this gap and connect the dots… not as a substitute to existing initiatives, projects, events, and organizations but as a shared layer for all of them. A neutral initiative and brand that brings the different stakeholders together and also aims to leverage and support existing initiatives that want to foster the startup ecosystem in Austria. A little bit of organization neededWe are so good together The neutral platform AustrianStartups acts as an aggregator and multiplicator for information, activities, and initiatives that are relevant to the startup community. Naturally, a form of organization is needed to funnel operations and ensure a structure that is bringing things forward. To ensure the most important part of it, the neutrality, we decided to create a non-profit organization (“Verein”), where any interested person can become a member. National Community, Aggregated Ressources & Common Voice To summarize, AustrianStartups intends to establish 3 pillars on which we hope the Austrian startup community can even grow bigger and get better connected: First, creating a more connected national community for startups in Austria, and bringing all entrepreneurs together through initiatives like local meetups, an online forum, aggregated content on our Facebook page, and regional representatives. Second, offering an in-depth and growing overview of the ecosystem itself, essential entrepreneurial tools, information, and events. Third, by bringing relevant stakeholders together with startups, we want to formulate up-to-date needs and demands, and face them together with the community… a common voice to the public, so to speak.

We see ourselves as community initiative that wants to create significant impact, not more, not less. We are also not a substitute to official and/or public institutions such as the chamber of commerce, public incubators, public support and/or grant institutions. We are an additional layer to them, trying to cater to the specific needs of startups, which are a bit different than those of small and medium enterprises. Aren’t startups just small & medium enterprises anyway? We believe that there is a difference between all entrepreneurs and specifically startups. All startups are entrepreneurs, but not all entrepreneurs (who we believe are all together the backbone of the economy!) are necessarily startups. If you see and define yourself as a startup, chances are high that you actually are one. If you are not sure, then the closest definition we could find would be along the thoughts of Steve Bank (best-selling author and one of the fathers of the Lean startup movement) and Paul Graham (Founder of Y-combinator): “A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.” – Steve Blank “A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.” – Paul Graham In other words: startups can come in all forms, but are united in their association with (potentially) fast/strong growth as well as their search for a scalable business model. They are mostly, but not exclusively, technology-oriented companies*, many of which seek to disrupt an existing market or to create a new market. * whereas technology includes, but is not solely limited to: Hardware, Software, Internet & Mobile Technologies, Communication, Bio-Tech, Medical, Robotics, Electronics, Mechatronics, Energy, Transportation, Environmental,… What YOU can do Sign-up for FREE and become a member to benefit from increasing specials such as newsletter, invitation to meetings (Stammtisch), be visible with your startup on the StartupMap, bring in your own project ideas for the startup ecosystem (and launch them with us), and have a vote in how and where AustrianStartups should be active… more goodies to follow. Companies, organizations and legal entities, which want to support AustrianStartups, can do so as supporting members. Currently we are talking with stakeholders, foundations, and individuals who want to contribute to AustrianStartups. We are open for talks with everyone, but want and have to ensure the neutrality of AustrianStartups at any time. Therefore, if needed, we would also decline a partnership with potentially interested supporting members. Beside the already announced supporting members, we are glad to present our main sponsors: the Internet Foundation Austria (IPA) known for its internet grant scheme netidee, which provides us with crucial support in the initial phase.

Mit der neuen Kategorie Landwirtschaft spricht greenstart weitere innovative Entrepreneurs an, die unser Land nachhaltig gestalten. Als Teil des Unternehmens Energiewende schaffen sie Green Jobs und stärken den Wirtschaftsstandort.“ Ob grüne, marktdynamische Stromversorgung, Nachhaltigkeit im Alltag mittels Gamification oder Photovoltaik-Einkaufsgemeinschaft für Unternehmen: „awattar“, „Ökogotschi“ und „Tausendundein Dach“ zeigen als Sieger des greenstart Wettbewerbes 2014 welch unterschiedliche Ideen und Konzepte eingereicht werden können. Mehr als 60 Einreichungen waren es im Vorjahr, mit der neuen Kategorie Landwirtschaft und der bereits etablierten Community wird heuer eine noch größere Vielfalt erwartet. „Die Top-3 greenstarter aus 2014 behaupten sich erfolgreich am Markt – das war unser Ziel und wir sind stolz auf diesen Erfolg. Heuer möchten wir den Weg fortsetzen und weitere grüne Geschäftsideen im heimischen Business etablieren. Wir schaffen damit konkrete Lösungen zur Umsetzung der Energiewende“, sagt Ingmar Höbarth, Geschäftsführer des Klima- und Energiefonds. Neuerungen für noch mehr Themenvielfalt und mehr Einreichungen In den kommenden Wochen und Monaten werden im Rahmen von greenstart in ausgewählten Klima- und Energiemodellregionen laufend Workshops abgehalten, bei denen Ideen für grüne Geschäftsmodelle entwickelt werden. Dabei wird eng mit den Nachhaltigkeitsverantwortlichen der Region zusammengearbeitet, um die Potenziale vor Ort zu identifizieren, Personen mit guten Ideen zu vernetzen und den Wettbewerb vorzustellen. Bewährte Formate werden fortgeführt Auch heuer erhalten greenstarter in einem zweistufigen Wettbewerb finanzielle Unterstützung, Workshops und Coachings in Kooperation mit dem Impact Hub Vienna und Preisgelder, um aus einer anfänglichen Geschäftsidee ein umsetzbares Konzept zu entwickeln: Im ersten Schritt können Start-Ups, Privatpersonen oder junge Unternehmen ihre neue Idee einfach und unkompliziert ab sofort bis 20.12.2015 einreichen. Nach Einreichschluss wählt die Jury die zehn vielversprechendsten Ideen aus. Diese TOP-10 erhalten im zweiten Schritt je € 6.000,- an Unterstützung für die Qualifizierungsphase, bei der in individuellen Workshops und Coachings aus der anfänglichen Idee ein ausgereiftes Geschäftsmodell erarbeitet wird. Eine erneute Bewertung entscheidet schließlich über drei Gewinnerprojekte – den Siegerinnen und Siegern winken je € 15.000,- Preisgeld. Alle EinreicherInnen profitieren Da die erfolgreichsten Ideen oft zu Beginn unentdeckt bleiben, hat sich greenstart zum Ziel gesetzt, alle EinreicherInnen zu unterstützen. greenstart.at fungiert nicht nur als Informations- sondern auch als Vernetzungsplattform – eingereichte Business-Ideen können online präsentiert werden.

Früher wurde er einfach auf die Felder ausgebracht, heute muss er aus ökologischen Gründen um teures Geld – rund 300 Euro pro Tonne – entsorgt werden. Aber es geht auch anders, ist der Firmengründer überzeugt. Er entwickelte in zweijähriger intensiver Arbeit das sogenannte RSR-Verfahren (Recovered Sludge Resources), einen mehrstufigen Prozess, in dem anorganische Materialien entfernt, Rückstände oxidiert und Phosphor zurückgewonnen wird. Phosphor und Brennstoff. Rückenwind erhält Green Sentinel durch die deutsche Klärschlammverordnung, die eine Phosphor-Rückgewinnung für mittlere und große Kläranlagen vorschreibt. Die BetreiberInnen müssen bis 2023 ein entsprechendes Konzept dafür vorlegen. Auch in Österreich ist mit ähnlichen Vorschriften zu rechnen. „Das wahre Potenzial des Klärschlamms liegt jedoch nicht im Phosphor für die Düngemittelindustrie, sondern im hohen Heizwert, der über jenem von Braunkohle liegt“, erklärt Scheiböck-Ortner. „Unser Ersatzbrennstoff kann in gängigen Feststoff-Heizkesseln ab 50 kW eingesetzt werden.“ Daniel Scheiböck-Ortner ist Biotechnologe und hat drei Jahre Berufserfahrung in den Bereichen Abwassertechnik und Industrieanlagenbau. Dabei betreute er auch Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte. Sein Team setzt sich aus bestens qualifizierten, jungen Technikern zusammen, die zusätzliche Erfahrung aus den Bereichen Verfahrenstechnik sowie Industrieanlagenplanung und Bau mitbringen. Darüber hinaus unterstützt ein unternehmenseigenes Expertenboard aus Branchenkennern und Betriebswirten mit seiner Expertise. Startbereit. Am 1. August wurde die GmbH gegründet, Ende des ersten Quartals 2021 soll die erste Anlage fertig sein. Green Sentinel bietet stationäre Aufbereitungsanlagen für Kläranlagen und für Energieversorger, die schon bisher Klärschlamm thermisch verwerten, zum Kauf an. BetreiberInnen kleiner Klärwerke können auch eine mobile Anlage anmieten. greenstart, die Start-up-Initiative des Klima- und Energiefonds, erwies sich als sehr nützlich. „Vor allem die Vernetzung ist für uns sehr wichtig“, sagt Scheiböck-Ortner. „Dabei sind der Klima- und Energiefonds und die Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen (KEM) für uns unverzichtbar.“ Er hofft, dass seine ganzheitliche Lösung für den Umgang mit Klärschlamm in möglichst vielen KEMs diskutiert und umgesetzt wird. Großauftrag. Die ersten Anlagen werden aber wohl nach Deutschland gehen. Aber auch hierzulande ist das Marktpotenzial gewaltig. Denn in Österreich fallen jährlich 235.000 Tonnen Trockenmasse an Klärschlamm an – und die BetreiberInnen können mit der neuen Technologie zwischen 40 und 70 Prozent der Kosten im Vergleich zur Entsorgung einsparen.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/treatment-plant-wastewater-2826990_1920.jpg","29.09.2020","de",0.99958735704422,0.00770171731710434,0.744207143783569,0.144513219594955,0.103577874600887

Das ließ dem Großhändler keine Ruhe und er begann zuerst allein, dann gemeinsam mit dem Photovoltaikspezialisten und ehemaligen Geschäftsführer der Ertex Solar-Amstetten, Martin Aichinger, an einem salzwasserbeständigen Photovoltaiksystem zu arbeiten. Vier Jahre lang widmeten sie sich die beiden der Entwicklung, bevor sie im Vorjahr die SolOcean GmbH gründeten. Salzresistent. „Schwimmende Photovoltaik ist nicht neu“, erklärt Guger. „Aber nur unser System hält auf Dauer auch Salzwasser, Strömung und Wellen stand.“ Herkömmliche Photovoltaikpaneele werden an der Vorderseite verglast und auf der Rückseite mit einer Kunststofffolie versehen. SolOcean verwendet dagegen auch für der Rückseite Glas und lässt die Paneele bei einem österreichischen Produzenten fertigen. Eine spezielle Randversiegelung gewährleistet, dass mindestens 30 Jahre lang weder Wasser noch Salz eindringen können. Durch die natürliche (Wasser-)Kühlung und die Oberflächenstruktur der Paneele liefert die „Floating Photovoltaik“ von SolOcean auch ein gutes Fünftel mehr Strom als vergleichbare Anlagen. Den selbst entwickelten zwei Quadratmeter großen Floater, auch Schwimmkörper genannt, lässt SolOcean beim Kunststoffspezialisten Rehau produzieren. Dieser besteht aus UV-stabilem und salzwasserresistentem HDPE-Kunststoff und verfügt über bis zu 430 Kilogramm Auftrieb. Für ruhige Gewässer bietet SolOcean auch eine abgespeckte Version mit weniger Auftrieb an. Die Floater werden aneinander und an Mooringleinen befestigt sowie mit einer patentierten Steckverbindung verschaltet. Die ebenfalls patentierte Solarglasbeschichtung sorgt für eine nahezu selbstständige Reinigung des Kraftwerks durch Wind und Wasser. Vögel werden mit Ultraschall vergrämt – denn so eine kleine schwimmende Insel fernab von Fressfeinden wäre natürlich ein einladender Nistplatz. Sonne statt Diesel. „Ich habe bei einer Malediven-Reise vor einigen Jahren mitbekommen und danach recherchiert, dass die Inseln jährlich mit 517 Millionen Liter Diesel beliefert werden – das entspricht etwa 1,5 Millionen Tonnen jährlichem CO2-Ausstoß“, so Guger. „Land ist hier sehr kostbar, aber rundherum gibt es unendlich viel Meer. Auf einer vergleichsweise winzigen Meeresfläche könnte der gesamte Inselstaat mit Sonnenstrom versorgt werden – und das bei einer Amortisationszeit von lediglich 3,5 Jahren. In Kombination mit einer Speicherlösung würde auch die Versorgung in der Nacht sichergestellt – allerdings bei der doppelten Amortisationszeit.“ Erste Aufträge der Malediven und aus Bayern liegen bereits vor. Im Herbst soll ein allererstes SolOcean-Kraftwerk in Niederösterreich errichtet werden. Die internationalen Aufträge hofft Guger im ersten und zweiten Quartal 2021 umsetzen zu können. Auch für Österreich sehen Guger und Aichinger Marktpotenziale. „Wollen wir in Österreich die Klimaziele erreichen, werden die vorhandenen Dachflächen für die Photovoltaik nicht ausreichen“, meint Guger und schlägt vor, Speicher- und Stauseen für die Solarstromgewinnung zu nutzen. „Würden wir ein Drittel dieser Fläche nutzen, entspräche das einer Leistung von fünf Gigawatt oder zwei mittleren Atomkraftwerken.“ Künstliche Gewässer nutzen. „Wir sind glücklich, unter die Top-10 von greenstart gekommen zu sein, und wurden daraufhin auch schon mehrfach von verschiedenen Unternehmen und Energieversorgern kontaktiert“, freut sich Guger. Von den Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen wünscht er sich vor allem, dass diese die schwimmende Stromproduktion „einmal andenken“.

Bei der gestrigen Preisverleihung übergaben Sektionschef Günter Liebel und Klima- und Energiefonds-Geschäftsführer Ingmar Höbarth den drei Gewinner-Teams Preisgelder von je 15.000 Euro. Umweltminister Andrä Rupprechter: „Ich gratuliere den drei Gewinner-Teams herzlich. Mit ihren Ideen und ihrem Engagement reduzieren sie den CO2-Ausstoß und sind gleichzeitig wirtschaftlich erfolgreich. Außerdem lösen sie eine positive Kettenreaktion aus: Die jungen, klimaschonenden Unternehmen gehen vorbildhaft voran und inspirieren damit viele weitere.“ 47 Projekt-Ideen wurden bei greenstart eingereicht, zehn Start-Ups schafften es mit vielfältigen Ideen ins Finale und entwickelten diese sechs Monate lang unter professioneller Begleitung zu marktfähigen Geschäftsmodellen weiter. Die zehn Start-Ups stellten sich anschließend einer Fachjury und einem Online-Voting, welche die TOP-3 kürten: Die „2-Kammern-Organismenwanderhilfe“ ist eine universell einsetzbare Fischtreppe, die neben der Gewässerdurchgängigkeit im Bereich von Querbauwerken auch elektrische Energie bereitstellt. Das Team von „E²T – Efficient Energy Technology“ hat ein Mini-Kraftwerk aus Photovoltaik und Speicher entwickelt, das von EndkonsumentInnen selbst installiert werden kann und bis zu einem Viertel des Strombedarfs im Haushalt deckt. „Fahrrad der Zukunft“ möchte die Fahrradproduktion mit einem Kunststoff-Spritzgussverfahren revolutionieren, welches den CO2-Ausstoß um über 50% senkt und zudem die Fahrradrahmenproduktion zurück nach Europa bringen könnte. Ingmar Höbarth, Geschäftsführer des Klima- und Energiefonds freut sich über den Erfolg von greenstart: „Viele der mittlerweile 30 jungen Unternehmen, diewir mit greenstart begleitet haben, sind höchst erfolgreich am Markt. Wir planen in den nächsten Monaten eine neue Ausschreibung, bei der wir uns wieder auf spannende, neue Business-Ideen freuen.“ 2-Kammern-Organismen-Wanderhilfe – FISHCON WER WIR SIND: Wir von der 2-Kammern-Organismenwanderhilfe wollen zeigen, dass der ökologische Gewässerschutz und die Wasserkraftnutzung auch vereint werden können. Mit unserer innovativen Fischschleuse kann die Fischwanderung schonend und einfach ermöglicht werden und der Leitstrom ohne großen Mehraufwand energetisch genutzt werden. Dies ist für die Umwelt gut – aber auch für die Wirtschaftlichkeit! WARUM GREENSTART? Von der Idee zum Business – das war unser Ziel bei greenstart. Nach der Entwicklung und Patentierung des Systems war es notwendig, das unternehmerische Knowhow im Team zu stärken und Aufmerksamkeit zu gewinnen. Dafür ist greenstart ideal! WAS WIR SUCHEN: Wir suchen Standorte für erste Pilotanlagen und Unternehmen, die wie wir an die 2-Kammern-Organismenwanderhilfe glauben und als Partner Bauteile der 2-Kammern-Organismenwanderhilfe (Turbine, Schieber und Co.) fertigen möchten bzw. uns im Vertrieb unterstützen wollen. E²T – Efficient Energy Technology WER WIR SIND: E²T ist ein Spin-Off der TU Graz und hat das einzigartige Kleinstkraftwerk „SolMate“ entwickelt. SolMate ist ein kleines Kraftwerk (bestehend aus Photovoltaik und Speicher), welches am Balkon angebracht und einfach in eine gewöhnliche Steckdose eingesteckt wird. Der selbstproduzierte Grünstrom wird über die Steckdose zurückgespeist und kann über die normalen Stromleitungen in der gesamten Wohnung genutzt werden. WARUM GREENSTART? greenstart ist eine super Möglichkeit, um unser Produkt in der Bundeshauptstadt zu bewerben, Netzwerke zu nutzen und wertvolles Feedback zu unserem Business-Modell zu erhalten. WAS WIR SUCHEN: In erster Linie suchen wir potenzielle VertriebspartnerInnen und Unterstützer im Bereich Sales, Marketing und PR, denn in diesen Bereichen haben wir kaum Erfahrung. Fahrrad der Zukunft WER WIR SIND: Wir haben uns zum Ziel gesetzt, Fahrräder und deren komplettes Herstellungsverfahren grundlegend zu revolutionieren. Wir bringen recycle- & wiederverwertbare Kunststoffe in eine unverwechselbare Formensprache und funktionalisieren ihre Oberflächen. Mit unserer patentierten Verfahrenstechnik zur Herstellung von Fahrrädern können wir die Herstellungskosten und den CO2-Ausstoß um über 50 % reduzieren und bringen die Wertschöpfungskette wieder zurück nach Europa. WARUM GREENSTART? Im Zuge unserer Entwicklungsarbeit ist uns bewusstgeworden, welchen riesigen ökologischen Nutzen wir durch die Substituierung des Werkstoffs Aluminium erzielen. greenstart ist hierfür die ideale Plattform, um unser Ergebnis der Fachjury und der breiten Öffentlichkeit zu präsentieren. Das Programm von greenstart hat uns sehr geholfen den Business-Plan im Detail zu durchleuchten und daran zu feilen. WAS WIR SUCHEN: Interessante Menschen, die mit einer Vision die Realität verändern! Personen, mit denen man sich austauschen kann und die mit ihrer Erfahrung zum Erfolg beitragen können.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/Die-TOP-Start-Ups-Sieger-des-Wettbewerbs-greenstart-pra¨miert.png","21.11.2017","de",0.997650325298309,6.68096918161609e-05,0.828561991453171,0.000176737641595537,0.171194480382837

Dort, wo 99,9 Prozent der Menschen nur noch „Bahnhof“ verstehen, wird es für Philipp Hungerländer erst richtig spannend – besonders, wenn die zu lösenden Probleme aus der Praxis stammen. Hungerländer ist, obwohl erst 35 Jahre alt, Professor an der Universität Klagenfurt und CEO der Hex GmbH. Das im Juli 2017 gegründete Unternehmen widmet sich der Entwicklung innovativer Software für logistische Probleme. Kilometer sparen. Kunde der Hex GmbH sind die ÖBB, für die Hungerländers Team eine Software entwickelte, die Loks und TriebfahrzeugführerInnen immer dorthin schickt, wo sie gerade gebraucht werden. „Nun testen wir eine Cloud-IT-Lösung für den Betrieb von Mikro-ÖV-Systemen“, erklärt Marissa Florian, Chief Business Development Officer bei Hex. „Oft werden die Fahrten noch mit menschlicher Brainpower geplant. Kommen aber mehrere Fahrzeuge oder auch mehrere Bus- und Taxiunternehmen ins Spiel, wird die optimale Routenplanung des Bedarfsverkehrs kompliziert. Hier liefert unser Algorithmus Optimierung und Informationen in Echtzeit.“ Seit September 2019 dient das Untere Drautal mit seinem Rufbus namens RUDi für Hex als Pilotregion. Bestehende Bus- und Bahnlinien werden von der Software berücksichtigt, schließlich sind RUDi und andere österreichische Mikro-ÖV-Systeme als Ergänzung und nicht als Konkurrenz zum öffentlichen Verkehr ins Leben gerufen worden. Gleichzeitig dient die Software auch der Personalplanung und der Abrechnung von Fahrten. Aktuell entwickelt das Team eine Handy-App zur Buchung von Mikro-ÖV-Fahrten. Maßgeschneidert. Hex adaptiert die Software für die jeweiligen AnwenderInnen. Denn es gibt Rufbusse, Anrufsammeltaxis, Dorfmobile, Seniorenfahrtendienste oder einen Mix verschiedener Systeme, unterschiedliche Tarifsysteme und Zahlungsmethoden, ehrenamtliche und bezahlte LenkerInnen, aber auch zusätzliche Angebote einzelner Gemeinden – zum Beispiel ein Abholservice für mobilitätseingeschränkte Menschen. Auch mit Elektrofahrzeugen kennt sich der Algorithmus aus und vergisst nicht auf Ladepausen. Derzeit genießen Florian und Hungerländer die Vernetzung, den Austausch und den „Blick von außen“ im Rahmen des Klimafonds-Start-up-Wettbewerbs greenstart. „Die Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen sind eine wichtige Zielgruppe für uns. Wir hoffen auf einen offenen Austausch“, sagt Florian. „Die Software lässt sich per Videokonferenz sowohl in der Administrator- als auch in der Kundenansicht vorstellen. Umgekehrt sind wir sehr an den unterschiedlichen regionalen Bedürfnissen und Herangehensweisen an den Mikro-ÖV interessiert.“ Gründung. Hungerländer plant, für die Mikro-ÖV-Software ein eigenes Start-up zu gründen. „hex.drive“ lautet der Arbeitstitel. Neben Software und Support bietet Hex auch die Mitentwicklung regionaler Mobilitätskonzepte an. In den nächsten Jahren soll nicht nur im heimischen Mikro-ÖV gehext werden, sondern auch im benachbarten Ausland, vor allem in Südtirol und Bayern.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Mock-up-scaled.jpg","30.09.2020","de",0.99929541349411,0.000189628699445166,0.948691248893738,0.000309841649141163,0.0508092455565929

Zwei Teams betreiben Web-basierte Services für nachhaltige Mobilität im ländlichen Raum: „Triply“ ist dabei spezialisiert auf effiziente Transportkonzepte für Veranstaltungen, um die Sicherheit von BesucherInnen zu erhöhen. Die Echtzeit-Mitfahrplattform von „ummadum“ richtet sich an PendlerInnen und ist mit einem Punktekonto verknüpft, das in der regionalen Wirtschaft zum Einkaufen verwendet werden kann. Das Ziel von „Reisebunt.com“ ist es, mittels kostenloser CO2-Kompensation das Reisen klimafreundlich zu machen – für jede Reisebuchung über die Plattform werden Bäume in Äthiopien gepflanzt. Zu den Finalisten-Teams aus dem Bereich Landwirtschaft zählen „micromacro“, die LandwirtInnen mit ihrer App eine niederschwellige Möglichkeit bieten, das Potenzial klimaschonender Hecken voll auszuschöpfen. Um die Effizienz der Pflanzenproduktion geht es dem Team von „Etagrow“: Ihre neuartige Technologie zur Beleuchtung von Gewächshäusern reduziert den Energieverbrauch um 50%. Der achtsame Umgang mit Ressourcen ist auch für die weiteren TOP-10 von hoher Bedeutung: „CLEANVEST by ESG+“ ist eine digitale Plattform, die es PrivatinvestorInnen ermöglicht, klimaschonende und sozial nachhaltige Fonds zu finden und in sie zu investieren. Die robusten, einfach zu reinigenden Mobiltoiletten von „Öklo“ tragen ebenfalls zur Ressourcenschonung bei: So müssen die Hinterlassenschaften nicht mit hohen Energieaufwand geklärt werden und pro Toilettengang werden ca. 5 Liter Trinkwasser gespart. Das Team hinter „Plasticpreneur“ entwickelt einfach herzustellende und kostengünstige Maschinen zur Verarbeitung von Kunststoffabfällen. Um die Vermeidung von Plastikmüll geht es auch bei „Meine Wollke“: Die wiederverwendbare, gesunde Slipeinlage aus Bio-Baumwolle ersetzt zahlreiche Wegwerfprodukte.

Den Auftakt des Bühnenprogramms machte Christoph Wolfsegger, Programm-Manager des Klima- und Energiefonds, der mit seinem Beitrag deutlich machte, dass die aktuellen Entwicklungen rund um das Weltklima zwar „big“ und „serious“ sind, aber daher auch Möglichkeiten für „big and serious Business“ bieten. Um den Klimawandel einzubremsen, sind enorme Investitionen in CO2-sparende Unternehmen notwendig. „Erfolg ist immer geplant“ In der folgenden Podiumsdiskussion ging es unter dem Thema “Building & Developing Sustainable and Green Business Ideas” um die internationalen Rahmenbedingungen für „grüne“ Start-Ups. Unter der Moderation von Dejan Jovicevic (DerBrutkasten), diskutierten die beiden Start-Up-GründerInnen Janice Goodenough (HYDROGRID) und Ugo Ugbor (PP Energy) mit Alois Posekufa Mhlanga (UNIDO) und Christoph Wolfsegger als zwei Vertretern von Institutionen, die GründerInnen unterstützen. Mhlangas Aufgabe ist es, Start-Ups und etablierte Institutionen in verschiedenen Ländern zusammenzubringen. Gemeinsam mit Ugbor unterstrich er, dass ein internationaler Blickwinkel sehr hilfreich ist – denn der Klimawandel macht nicht an Staatsgrenzen halt; und eine Business-Idee ist nicht notwendigerweise dort am effektivsten, wo der Gründer oder die Gründerin gerade lebt. An die anwesenden Start-Up-GründerInnen gerichtet, gab Goodenough zwei wichtige Hinweise für eine erfolgreiche Business-Idee: Sie muss ein reales Problem lösen und skalierbar sein. „Erfolg ist immer geplant“, betonte Ugbor die Wichtigkeit einer strategischen, überlegten Herangehensweise. Interaktion, Austausch & Networking Anschließend kamen die BesucherInnen selbst zu Wort: In drei Diskussionsrunden zu den Themen Energie, Mobilität und Landwirtschaft brachten sie ihre eigenen Sichtweisen ein und stellten ihre Business-Ideen vor. Die anwesenden ExpertInnen, Coaches, ehemalige greenstart-TeilnehmerInnen und die weiteren Anwesenden gaben Feedback zu den Business-Ideen und möglichen nächsten Schritten – wie beispielsweise einer Teilnahme bei greenstart. In lockerem Ambiente bei Speis und Trank von regionalen Start-Ups wie beispielsweise den greenstart-Alumni Hut&Stiel und HELGA konnte der interaktive und inspirierende Abend ausklingen.

Auch in der Buchhaltung machen viele kleine Rechnungen mehr Arbeit als eine große. Der Nachteil bei der Beschaffung wie bisher: Die Waren kommen oft von weit her – und mitunter bleibt gleich nebenan ein Landwirtschaftsbetrieb auf seinem frischen Obst und Gemüse sitzen. In Österreich fallen pro Jahr zwischen 150.000 und 200.000 Tonnen „Überschussware“ an. Vom Feld in die Küche. Dazu planen die FirmengründerInnen eine Online-Plattform, auf der die KüchenchefInnen alles vom Apfel bis zur Zwiebel bestellen können. „Wir besorgen Obst und Gemüse bei verschiedenen regionalen Betrieben, kümmern uns um die Logistik und liefern die Ware dann mit einer Rechnung.“ Mitgeliefert wird ein Zertifikat, aus dem hervorgeht, wie viel CO2 mit dem Einkauf eingespart wurde. Nur Produkte, die saisonal nicht regional verfügbar sind, werden vom GemüseGepard beim Großhandel besorgt. Aber auch hier wird auf möglichst kurze Transportdistanzen geachtet. Ende August startete ein Testlauf mit zwei Gastronomiebetrieben. Wenn alles wie geplant klappt, soll die Bestellplattform im zweiten Quartal 2021 online gehen. Vienna first. In einem ersten Schritt möchte sich der GemüseGepard auf den Raum Wien beschränken und sein Angebot sukzessive auf andere österreichische Ballungszentren ausdehnen. Auch Convenience-Produkte sollen angeboten werden – schließlich schneiden die meisten Gastronomiebetriebe ihre Pommes nicht mehr selbst. Bis zum Markteintritt nächstes Jahr freuen sich die FirmengründerInnen auf neue Kontakte zu Betrieben aus den Bereichen Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelverarbeitung und Gastronomie. Ein neuer Vertriebsweg für landwirtschaftliche Produkte – das könnte auch den Obst- und Gemüsebauern in den Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen helfen, Lebensmittelverschwendung zu vermeiden und verloren geglaubte Überschüsse doch noch an den Mann oder die Frau zu bringen.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/b61a5fc6-ba23-43bd-bef8-cc3e0cc34bae.jpg","29.09.2020","de",0.999159038066864,0.0650972127914429,0.838079810142517,0.0667847245931625,0.0300382245332003

Innovation-Farm Innovation-Farm entwickelt und produziert in einem lokalen Netzwerk in der Region die „Roundgrip“ Metallbereifung für Agrar-, Kommunal- und Baumaschinen. Mit ihrem Fertigungsnetzwerk produzieren sie Just-in-time mit kurzen Produktionswegen ein 100 % österreichisches Produkt. Die „Roundgrip“ Metallräder können gleich mit mehreren Vorteilen punkten: Sie schonen die Umwelt, weil sie den Boden belüften und somit die Wasseraufnahme fördern, laufen vibrationsfrei und dennoch mit bestem Grip um Grünland, sind voll recyclebar und haben keinen schädlichen Gummiabrieb. Außerdem haben sie eine lange Lebensdauer und durch die Selbstreinigung wird Futterverschmutzung vermieden und so die Gesundheit der Tiere gefördert. Lignovations (in Gründung) Lignovations bietet mit seinen kolloidalen Ligninpartikeln einen nachhaltigen, biologisch abbaubaren und unbedenklichen Ersatz für problematische synthetische Inhaltsstoffe wie UV-Filter, Emulgatoren, Antioxidantien oder antimikrobielle Inhaltsstoffe. Das Lignin wird aus verholzter Biomasse gewonnen und mit einem patentierten Prozess in multifunktionelle, industrietaugliche kolloidale Partikel umgewandelt, die in einer Vielzahl an Endprodukten wie z.B. Sonnencremen, Lacken, Anstrichen, Holzschutz, Verpackungen und funktionellen Textilien eingesetzt werden können. Der Einsatz von nachhaltigen kolloidalen Ligninpartikeln verringert den Verbrauch fossiler Ressourcen und ersetzt Stoffe mit schädlichen Auswirkungen auf Menschen, Tiere und Umwelt. Plantika (in Gründung) Ganz nach dem Motto „Kopf hoch! Es wird grün“ produziert und entwickelt Plantika Dachbegrünungs-Module zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität in der Stadt. Für die Produktion der Module werden ausschließlich recycelbare oder natürliche und kompostierbare Materialien verwendet. Das patentierte Konzept ermöglicht auch die Begrünung von Blech- und Ziegeldächern. Diese bilden zwar den größten Teil der Dächer, sind aber mit den heutigen Methoden nicht begrünbar. Zudem bietet Plantika auch vertikale Fassadenbegrünung und modulare Einheiten zur Begrünung von Fensterblechen. REED.uce – noise protection technologies Mit dem steigenden Ausbau des Straßennetzes und der wachsenden Besiedelung von verkehrsnahen Gebieten wächst auch das Bedürfnis nach Ruhe und die Notwendigkeit für Lärmschutzmaßnahmen. Um einen Beitrag zur Nachhaltigkeit im Lärmschutz und im Straßenbau zu leisten hat REED.uce eine 100 % ökologische Lärmschutzwand aus Schilf (engl.: reed), Thermoholz und Lehm entwickelt. Die REED.uce ökologische Lärmschutzwand bietet gegenüber konventionellen Produkten (aus Beton, Aluminium oder chemisch imprägniertem Holz) zahlreiche nachhaltige Vorteile: sie besteht aus erneuerbaren, regionalen Ressourcen, ist rückbaubar im Sinne der Kreislaufwirtschaft, senkt CO2-Emissionen und bietet ein wertvolles Zuhause für Insekten.

Die TOP-3 Hut & Stiel – die Wiener Pilzkultur WER WIR SIND: Hut & Stiel steht für Stadtlandwirtschaft, unter Verwendung lokal vorhandener Ressourcen und umweltschonender Prozesse. Kern des Projektes ist die Zucht von Speisepilzen auf Kaffeesud – ein Abfallprodukt mit großem Potenzial. Die frisch geernteten Pilze werden direkt mit einem Lastenrad ausgeliefert bzw. auf Märkten verkauft. Kurze Transportwege garantieren höchste Qualität und Frische. Die Pilze werden auch zu Pesto, Sugo und Aufstrich verarbeitet. WARUM GREENSTART: greenstart bietet uns eine tolle Plattform, um unsere Idee der Speisepilzzucht auf Kaffeesud zu verbreiten. Das große Medieninteresse sowie das Netzwerk an ExpertInnen und deren Input und Know-How waren sehr hilfreich für die Entwicklung von Hut & Stiel im letzten Jahr. WAS WIR SUCHEN: Einen zusätzlichen Standort in oder um Wien. Da der Pilzzucht-Keller an den Kapazitätsgrenzen angelangt ist, halten wir momentan die Augen offen nach Möglichkeiten uns zu vergrößern. Dazu benötigen wir einen geeigneten neuen Standort bzw. Unterstützung bei der Suche, Planung und Finanzierung. nahgenuss – Bio-Schweinefleisch im Direktvertrieb WER WIR SIND: nahgenuss.at bietet Bio-Schweinebauern die Möglichkeit, Bio-Schweine als Ganzes – von der Nase bis zum Schwanz – an KonsumentInnen zu verkaufen.

WARUM GREENSTART: Wir sehen unser Projekt nahgenuss als einen wichtigen Beitrag zum bewussten Fleischkonsum. WAS WIR SUCHEN: Bio-Bauern und -Bäuerinnen, die ihre Bio-Schweine in Zukunft auch Ab-Hof verkaufen wollen. Kunden und Kundinnen, die ihr Fleisch in Zukunft regional und bio einkaufen. Menschen, die über uns berichten, ihren FreundInnen von uns erzählen oder uns einfach Feedback geben. Wohnwagon – Wege zur Autarkie WER WIR SIND: Wie sieht die Zukunft des Wohnens aus? Wir möchten mit unseren Projekten dazu inspirieren das Thema neu zu denken und zu zeigen, wie nachhaltiges, selbstbestimmtes Wohnen konkret aussehen kann! Der Wohnwagon versorgt sich dank Wasseraufbereitung, Strom- und Wärmeproduktion selbst – ohne externe Anschlüsse. Auf unserer Webplattform bieten wir einzelne Module und Lösungen für nachhaltiges Wohnen an und unterstützen mit Planung und Beratung bei der Umsetzung – vom Tiny House bis zum Mehrfamilienhaus!

"https://greenstart.at/news/im-rythmus-des-algorithmus/","Greenstart","Im Rythmus des Algorithmus","Etwa 30 Prozent des österreichischen Gesamtenergiebedarfs entfallen auf die Industrie. Bis zu einem Fünftel davon könnte allein durch eine optimierte Betriebsführung eingespart werden, wissen Bejamin Mörzinger, Markus Hoffmann und Anna Pölzl. Sie gründeten im Mai die Campfire Solutions GmbH, um dieses Potenzial zu heben. Forschungsarbeit. Die Idee zur Firmengründung hatte Mörzinger während der Arbeiten zu seiner Dissertation an der Technischen Universität Wien. Zuvor hatte er als Projektassistent am vierjährigen TU-Großprojekt „BaMa – Balanced Manufacturing“ mitgearbeitet und dabei einem österreichischen Halbleiterhersteller geholfen, seine Kältemaschinen mit zehn bis 20 Prozent weniger Strom zu betreiben. Die Grundlage dafür waren eine gesamtheitliche Betrachtung der Produktionsabläufe und eine Reihe von Software-Tools zu deren Optimierung. Nun entwickelt das Start-up eine eigene Optimierungssoftware namens KEEA – Knowledge-based Energy Efficiency Advisor. „Was KEEA macht, könnte man mit der Tätigkeit eines Psychotherapeuten umschreiben – nur dass nicht Menschen, sondern Fabriken gewissermaßen auf der Couch liegen“, erklärt Pölzl. „Die KundInnen geben uns ihre Daten, ihre Ziele sowie ihr typisches Verhalten bekannt und beantworten unsere Fragen. Daraus erstellt KEEA täglich eine Liste verschiedener Optionen, um diese Ziele zu erreichen.“ Tipps vom Computerhirn. Diese Vorschläge betreffen zum Beispiel den effizienten Einsatz der Maschinen oder die Erhöhung des Eigenverbrauchsanteils betriebseigener Photovoltaikanlagen. So können Maschinen, die nicht den ganzen Tag benötigt werden, bevorzugt dann in Betrieb genommen werden, wenn die Sonne kräftig scheint. „Gleichzeitig bietet KEEA auch die Möglichkeit, die erzielten Fortschritte bei der Energieeffizienz zu tracken“, so Pölzl. „Das ist besonders für jene Branchen sehr praktisch, die gesetzlichen Vorgaben zur Senkung des Energieverbrauchs unterliegen.“ In einem ersten Schritt konzentriert sich das Start-up auf den Stromverbrauch. Im Jänner 2021 soll die Plattform online gehen. Aktuell kooperiert Campfire Solutions mit zwei Unternehmen aus der Verpackungsindustrie im Rahmen eines Customer Advisory Boards sowie mit einem großen Energieversorger, um KEEA zur Marktreife zu führen. Noch 3 weitere Unternehmen werden als Entwicklungspartner gesucht – und auch ein neues Büro ab September.

"https://greenstart.at/news/jeder-einkauf-zaehlt/","Greenstart","Jeder Einkauf zählt","Jede und jeder einzelne kann viel zum Klimaschutz, zur Erhaltung der Biodiversität und zur Verbesserung von Produktionsbedingungen beitragen. „Allein die Lebensmittelindustrie ist für 26 Prozent der globalen CO2-Emissionen verantwortlich“, erklärt der Entrepreneur Markus Linder. „Aber auch andere alltägliche Kaufentscheidungen haben große Auswirkungen. Das reicht von der Wahl des Stromanbieters bis zum Kauf von Hygiene- und Körperpflegeartikeln.“ Unerwünschte Ingredienzien. Mit den meisten Duschgels kauft man nicht nur Unmengen an Plastik, sondern auch Palmöl. Eine palmölfreie Seife als Ersatz spart nicht nur Abfälle, sondern nimmt auch Druck von Regenwäldern und ihren bedrohten BewohnerInnen. Dass die kalifornischen Mandelmonokulturen wegen des hohen Pestizideinsatzes ganze Bienenvölker sterben lassen, ist bekannt. Dass nun auch Lachse dran glauben müssen, weil die umgebenden Gewässer für die Mandelbäume fast leer gepumpt werden, wissen nur die wenigsten. „Das Ziel unserer App ist, KonsumentInnen durch Information, aber auch durch Nudging und Gamification dabei zu helfen, ihre Einkäufe mit ihren eigenen Werthaltungen in Einklang zu bringen“, so Linder. „Schon beim Verlassen des Supermarkts erfahren UserInnen, wie viel CO2 sie eingespart oder wie viele Bienen sie durch ihr Kaufverhalten gerettet haben.“ Individuelle Kriterien. Dabei verzichtet INOQO ausdrücklich auf den erhobenen Zeigefinger. Die UserInnen können sich zu Beginn der App-Nutzung ein eigenes Profil erstellen, in dem sie festlegen, welche Aspekte ihnen wichtig sind und welche Inhaltsstoffe sie vermeiden möchten. Zur Auswahl werden eine Reihe an Kriterien aus den Bereichen Klimaschutz, Biodiversität und Gesundheit stehen. Auch soziale Aspekte wie Arbeitsbedingungen werden in die App einfließen. INOQO arbeitet dazu an einer neuen Technologie, um ein passives Tracking der eingekauften Waren zu ermöglichen. UserInnen müssen also nicht wie die KassierInnen jedes Produkt einzeln scannen oder eintippen. „Mit unserer App können KonsumentInnen die Änderungen in ihrem Einkaufsverhalten nachverfolgen und sie können ihr Profil jederzeit um neue Kriterien ergänzen“, sagt Linder. Sanfte Anstöße dazu wird es über die App und einen Newsletter geben. Partner für „grüne“ Marken. Finanzieren möchte sich INOQO über AnbieterInnen nachhaltiger Marken. Einerseits bietet die App die Möglichkeit, Zielgruppen mit Werbung punktgenau zu erreichen, anderseits verrechnet das Start-up eine kleine erfolgsabhängige Prämie für die Vermittlung neuer KundInnen. Im Lauf des Jahres soll eine Beta-Testphase starten. Bis dahin suchen Linder und seine Kollegin Hélène Saurais noch nach Unterstützung im Bereich Softwareentwicklung. Auch Firmen, die schon in der Testphase mit ihren Produkten in der App vertreten sein wollen, sind willkommen. Sehr hilfreich erlebte Linder auch das erste Coaching sowie den Austausch mit anderen GründerInnen im Rahmen von greenstart. Die Teilnahme an der Start-up-Initiative des Klima- und Energiefonds habe außerdem bereits für einige mediale Aufmerksamkeit gesorgt. „Auch die Klima- und Energie-Modellregion sind extrem spannend für uns“, meint Linder. Denn er sucht auch Bundesländer oder Regionen als Launchpartner und Premium-User. „Unsere App wird es möglich machen darzustellen, wie riesig der positive Effekt nachhaltigen Konsums ist, wenn sich ganze Regionen daran beteiligen. Sie wäre also gerade für KEMs ein geeignetes Tool im Bereich der Bewusstseinsbildung.“","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/3_INOQO.png","29.09.2020","de",0.998414516448975,0.000278576044365764,0.826272189617157,0.001821911893785,0.171627253293991

"https://greenstart.at/news/mehrweg-kuehlbox-statt-trockeneis/","Greenstart","Mehrweg-Kühlbox statt Trockeneis","Der Online-Handel boomt. Auch immer mehr Lebensmittel werden online bestellt und an die Haustüre geliefert. Das ist jedoch oft auch mit hohen CO2-Emissionen verbunden – nicht nur wegen des Transports, sondern vor allem wegen der Kühlung. „Kühl- und Tiefkühlware wird beim Transport meist mit Trockeneis – also mit festem Kohlendioxid – kalt gehalten“, erklärt temprify-CEO Moriz Lanzerstorfer. „Dabei entweichen große Mengen des Treibhausgases.“ Das belastet nicht nur das Klima, Trockeneis führt immer wieder auch zu tödlichen Unfällen durch Ersticken. Deshalb darf Trockeneis auch nicht im Postversand verwendet werden. Box mit Kühlakku. Das geht besser, dachten sich Lanzerstorfer und seine Mitgründer Nikolas Loidolt und Christian Bachleitner-Hofmann. So gründeten sie Anfang 2018 ihr Unternehmen temprify trading GmbH und entwickelten in Zusammenarbeit mit der Post passiv gekühlte Transportboxen. Die Kühlung erfolgt durch Akkus – ähnlich jenen für Kühltaschen, mit denen Familien schon in den 70er-Jahren ihre Schnitzelbrote und Schartner Bomben mit ins Freibad nahmen. Freilich sind die tempriBoxen weitaus stabiler und sollen mindestens fünf Jahre der nicht selten unsanften Behandlung auf Fließbändern und durch ZustellerInnen standhalten. Die Box für Kühlware besteht aus expandiertem Polypropylen (EPP). Die Box zum Transport von Tiefkühlware hat eine harte Polypropylen-Außenschale und wird mit Vakuumpaneelen gedämmt. Ein Einlegegitter sorgt dafür, dass die Luft um die Ware zirkulieren kann. „Dadurch reicht auch für den Transport von besonders sensibler Ware ein einziger vorgekühlter Akku aus“, erläutert Lanzerstorfer. Werden die Akkus auf -26° C gekühlt, können Produkte in der tempriBox mehr als einen Tag lang auf -18° C gehalten werden. Nach 32 Stunden sind es noch immer -15° C. Durch eine Plombierung mit Sicherheitsetiketten lässt sich erkennen, dass die Box unterwegs nicht geöffnet wurde. „Wir wollen jedoch nicht nur unsere Boxen vertreiben, sondern auch maßgeschneiderte Gesamtlösungen für das Handling temperatursensibler Produkte anbieten“, ergänzt Lanzerstorfer. Neben der tempriBox, die speziell für den Paketversand von Tiefkühlware entwickelt wurde, konnte das bewährte temprify-Kühlsystem auch an spezielle Kühlboxen für die taggleiche Auslieferung von Kühl- und Tiefkühlware (+2-8° C, -18° C) angepasst werden. Derzeit laufen Pilottests mit diversen Online-Supermärkten in Österreich, Deutschland und der Schweiz. Darüber hinaus möchte man ein System zur schnellen Vorkühlung der Akkus entwickeln. Weiters könnten die Waren dank tempriBoxen auch in ungekühlten Abholstationen zwischengelagert werden. Investoren gesucht. Bereits seit vergangenem Jahr ist die tempriBoxen-Serie in ganz Österreich im Paketversand von Tiefkühlware im Einsatz. Ende des Jahres sollen die neuen Boxen für den Lieferservice von Online-Supermärkten in Serie gehen. Um den großen Schritt auf den internationalen Markt zu stemmen, suchen die Jungunternehmer einerseits Vertriebspartner und anderseits Venture-Capital. An greenstart, der Start-up-Initiative des Klima- und Energiefonds, schätzt Lanzerstorfer vor allem den Austausch mit anderen Start-ups und ExpertInnen sowie die mediale Aufmerksamkeit, die temprify nun zuteil wird.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/temprify_Teamfoto-7-scaled.jpg","30.09.2020","de",0.998677909374237,0.000594761571846902,0.918902218341827,0.0350047126412392,0.0454982854425907
"https://greenstart.at/news/mit-dem-zug-nach-vietnam/","Greenstart","Mit dem Zug nach Vietnam","Gleich nach seiner Matura unternahm Elias Bohun eine Reise nach Vietnam. Da ihm Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaschutz wichtig sind, wollte er jedoch nicht fliegen und wählte die Bahn. Auf nach Asien. traivelling bietet Standardpakete von Wien nach Hanoi, Tokio und Bangkok an, stellt auf Anfrage aber auch individuelle Reisen zusammen. Die Tickets werden den Reisenden vorab zugesandt oder auf der Strecke hinterlegt. Denn hinter den EU-Grenzen gibt es oft nur Papier-Tickets. Aber wie lange fährt man eigentlich mit dem Zug bis Hanoi? „Mindestens acht Tage“, sagt Bohun. „Wir empfehlen aber, sich zumindest 16 Tage Zeit zu nehmen und Zwischenstopps in den Städten und Ländern auf der Route einzulegen, zum Beispiel in Kiew, Moskau, in der kasachischen Hauptstadt Nur-Sultan oder auch in den chinesischen Tropen.“ Dementsprechend richtet sich das Angebot von traivelling an Menschen, die sich für das Reisen Zeit nehmen, sei es – wie Bohun selbst – gleich nach der Matura, während der Uni-Ferien, in einem Sabbatical-Jahr oder auch in der Pension. Das Bahnfahren selbst ist bereits Teil des Erlebnisses. Statt mit dem Flugzeug in kürzester Zeit in einen anderen Teil der Welt versetzt zu werden, erlebt man in der Bahn die Übergänge zwischen unterschiedliche Klimazonen und Kulturkreisen – vor dem Fenster, aber auch in den teils historischen Waggons selbst. „Ich habe während meines ganzen Aufenthalts in Vietnam nicht so viele Menschen kennengelernt wie im Zug nach Hanoi“, meint Bohun. Aufbauarbeit. „Als Firmengründer hat man immer hundert Dinge gleichzeitig zu tun. Da hat uns greenstart sehr geholfen, unsere Milestones zu definieren und uns Deadlines zu setzen“, sagt Bohun zur Start-up-Initiative des Klima- und Energiefonds. Er genießt auch den Austausch mit anderen Start-ups. Unterstützung beim Aufbau des Unternehmens erhält der 19-jährige Elias Bohun von seinem Vater Matthias. Aktuell investieren die beiden viel Arbeit in die Entwicklung eines Online-Tools zur Buchung der komplexen Reisen und suchen dafür Verstärkung im Bereich IT. Mit dem Tool sollen potenzielle KundInnen ihre Routen auch selbst zusammenstellen können. An InvestorInnen wären Vater und Sohn Bohun ebenso sehr interessiert. Last but not least möchten die beiden ihre Kontakte zu KompetenzpartnerInnen in Sachen weltweite Buchung von Bahn- und Fährentickets ausbauen. Preiswerter Osten. Einige Ziele sind derzeit tatsächlich nicht mit der Bahn zu erreichen, zum Beispiel Indien oder der Großteil Afrikas. Dafür sind politische und militärische Konflikte sowie Failed States verantwortlich. „Es stimmt für Europa leider noch immer, dass Bahnfahren teurer als Fliegen ist“, rechnet Bohun. „Aber nach London beispielsweise kommt man über Brüssel zu vergleichbaren Preisen auch mit dem Zug. Und im Osten ist Bahnfahren weitaus günstiger als hierzulande.“ So kostet eine Bahnreise von Wien nach Hanoi etwa 650 Euro pro Richtung.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Vor-Transsib.jpg","30.09.2020","de",0.998801827430725,3.13504751829896e-05,0.996033132076263,0.000597289006691426,0.00333821028470993

Die beiden Brüder aus Graz motiviert das steigende Interesse der Kunden an Bio-Qualitätsfleisch. „Wir kennen viele Bio-Bauern, die sich für Fleisch keine gut funktionierende Vertriebsschiene aufbauen können, weil es ja eine besondere Logistik braucht. Dafür ist nahgenuss.at jetzt da“, erklären sie. Ganz und ganzheitlich – von der Nase bis zum Schwanz Der Kunde hat direkt mit dem Bauern Kontakt. Mit ihm können dann auch diverse Details geklärt werden. Der Kunde bestellt – mindestens – ein ¼ Schwein. Das sind rund 20 kg oder zwei Fächer in der Tiefkühltruhe. Ist das ganze Schwein verkauft, wird es geschlachtet und der Kunde kann es – in Teile zerlegt – abholen. In manchen Fällen wird es sogar geliefert. Jeder Bauer hat seine Lieferzeiten, mancher schlachtet jede Woche, der andere viermal im Jahr. „Die Bauern verkaufen das Schwein ‚von der Nase bis zum Schwanz‘. Daher gibt es keinen Verkauf einzelner ‚Gustostückerln‘. Bio-Schweinefleisch hat einfach höchste Qualität. Da können alle Teile des Tieres schmackhaft zubereitet werden“, so die beiden nahgenuss-Gründer. Bezahlt wird direkt bei den Bio-Bauern. Micha Beiglböck: „Die nahgenuss-Bauern können für das Bio-Schweinefleisch einen günstigen Preis anbieten, da der Zwischenhandel wegfällt.“ Chance für kleine Bio-Bauern Bio-Schweinefleisch hat einen ganz geringen Marktanteil. Nur 2 Prozent kommen aus ökologisch nachhaltiger Landwirtschaft. Bio-Schweine können Sonne, Regen und Wind spüren und rasten auf Stroheinstreu – so wie es sein sollte. Das Futter kommt fast immer vom eigenen Hof und wird nicht aus Übersee importiert. Und: „Bio-Schwein schmeckt viel besser!“, ist Micha Beiglböck überzeugt. Micha Beiglböck: „Wir sehen nahgenuss.at als Beitrag zur Förderung besonders der kleinen bäuerlichen Familienbetriebe. Gerade beim Schweinefleisch ist der Marktdruck für die Bauern groß. Es heißt: Entweder Ställe mit mehreren hunderten oder sogar tausenden Schweinen oder zusperren. Dabei gibt es – davon sind wir überzeugt – genügend Konsumenten, die gutes Fleisch suchen und bisher nicht wussten, wo sie es bekommen können.

Bei der virtuellen Preisverleihung wurden die drei Gewinner-Teams prämiert. Dieses Jahr konnten sich die Start-Ups Green Sentinel, Traivelling und Rebel Meat über den Titel „greenstar 2020“ sowie über ein Preisgeld von je 15.000 Euro freuen. Der Wettbewerb für nachhaltige Business-Ideen geht nun erstmals gleich ohne Pause in den nächsten Durchgang. Dieses Jahr heißt es deshalb: Nach der Preisverleihung ist vor der Einreichung, denn schon ab heute (bis 8. März 2021, 12 Uhr) können grüne Start-Ups wieder ihr eure nachhaltigen Ideen einreichen! – alle Informationen dazu findet ihr HIER. Bundesministerin Leonore Gewessler: „Ich gratuliere den drei Gewinner-Teams herzlich. Zugleich zeigen sie – wie alle anderen greenstarter in den vergangenen fünf Jahren – wie man mit innovativen und nachhaltigen Ideen Business machen kann. So werden grüne Ideen zu green Jobs, sichern den Wirtschaftsstandort Österreich und machen unser Land auch ein Stück lebenswerter.“ Ingmar Höbarth, Geschäftsführer des Klima- und Energiefonds: „Die greenstarter leisten mit ihren neuartigen Lösungsansätzen zur Reduktion des Treibhausgas-Ausstoßes einen wichtigen Beitrag. Auch heuer war das Potenzial der zehn FinalistInnen enorm. Wir freuen uns auf viele weitere Business-Ideen, denn der mittlerweile sechste greenstart Durchgang startet bereits heute.“ Im letzten halben Jahr konnten alle TOP-10 Start-Ups ihre Geschäftsideen mit Workshops, Coachings und ExpertenInnenberatung erfolgreich weiterentwickeln und von der finanziellen Unterstützung des Programms profitieren. Die zehn Start-Ups stellten sich anschließend erneut einer Fachjury und einem Online-Voting, bei dem die Öffentlichkeit für ihre Favoriten-Teams stimmen konnte. „And the winners are“: Das Team von „Rebel Meat“ hilft mit ihren Bio-Burgerpatties bestehend aus 50 % Fleisch und 50 % hochwertigen Pilzen, Hirse und Gewürzen, den Fleischkonsum zu reduzieren – ohne auf das Fleischerlebnis verzichten zu müssen. Eine Alternative zu Reisen mit dem Flugzeug bietet das Vater-Sohn-Gespann von „Traivelling“, die mit ihren Ticketpaketen klimaschonende Bahnreisen in Europa und sogar bis nach Asien ermöglichen. Das „Green Sentinel“-Team hat ein neuartiges Verfahren entwickelt, mit welchem werthaltige Produkte aus Klärschlamm gewonnen und wiederaufbereitet werden können. Die Online-Veranstaltung zum Nachsehen: Start für neue greenstart Einreichungen! Auch in der sechsten Runde des Programms „greenstart“ sucht der Klima- und Energiefonds in Kooperation mit dem Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz (BMK) wieder mutige JungunternehmerInnen, die mit ihren innovativen, Treibhausgas-einsparenden Projektideen und Start-Up-Konzepten die Jury begeistern. In den Bereichen erneuerbare Energien, Energieeffizienz, Mobilität, Landwirtschaft / Bioökonomie und in der neuen Kategorie Klimawandelanpassung, können nachhaltige Ideen bis zum 8. März 2021 (12 Uhr) online auf www.greenstart.at eingereicht werden. Alle Infos dazu findet ihr HIER. Aller Anfang ist ein Einreichformular Die Reise zum greenstar 2021 beginnt mit dem Ausfüllen des Antragsformulars. Danach wählt eine Fachjury jene Business Ideen aus, die das größte Marktpotenzial bei gleichzeitig hoher Treibhausgas-Einsparung haben. Die TOP-10-Start-Ups bekommen dann ein halbes Jahr begleitende Öffentlichkeitsarbeit, finanzielle Unterstützung (jeweils 10.000 EUR) sowie organisiertes Coaching und Networking zur Verfügung gestellt, um ihre Idee weiterzuentwickeln. Ein Online Voting und nochmalige Bewertung durch die Jury entscheidet dann schlussendlich darüber, wer im nächsten Jahr als TOP-3 greenstar prämiert wird und eine zusätzliche Unterstützung in der Höhe von jeweils 20.000 Euro bekommt. Terminhinweis: Ideen-Workshop am 11. Februar 2021 Für alle Interessierten, JungunternehmerInnen und Start-Ups mit nachhaltigen Business-Ideen findet am Donnerstag, 11.

Da sind sich Medizin, Klimaforschung und TierschützerInnen einig. Doch Gesundheit hin, Klimakrise und Tierfabriken her – es schmeckt uns einfach. „Ich habe schon viele Menschen erlebt, die sich vorgenommen haben, auf Fleisch zu verzichten, dann aber nur wenige Monate durchgehalten haben“, sagt Philipp Stangl, einer der Mitgründer von Rebel Meat. „Daher haben wir ein Produkt entwickelt, das unseren Hunger nach Fleisch stillt und trotzdem einen wichtigen Beitrag für Gesundheit, Klimaschutz und Tierwohl leistet.“ Know-how. Maßgeblich an dieser Entwicklung beteiligt war und ist Stangls Kollegin Cornelia Habacher. Sie studierte Molekulare Biologie, schrieb ihre Dissertation über molekulare Vorgänge beim Fettstoffwechsel und arbeitete für internationale Forschungsinstitute. Stangl selbst bringt mehr als sechs Jahre Erfahrung in der Start-up-Welt mit und regelt bei Rebel Meat Operations und Finanzen. Halb so viel Fleisch im Burger-Patty bedeutet halb so viel Methan-Emissionen aus Rindermägen. Das Fleisch stammt von einem oberösterreichischen und einem Waldviertler Biobetrieb. Auch die Biokräuterseitlinge und die Biohirse – beides wertvolle Proteinlieferanten – kommen aus Niederösterreich. So können außerdem die Transportwege kurz gehalten werden. Für Gastronomie und daheim. Seit vergangenem Herbst können die Patties von Rebel Meat in einigen Wiener Burgerlokalen genossen werden. „Nun ist unser Premiumprodukt auch im Großhandel vertreten, und wir arbeiten mit Hochdruck daran, es auch österreichweit in den Einzelhandel zu bringen“, erklärt Stangl. Eine Expansion auf den deutschen und den Schweizer Markt ist ebenfalls geplant. Preislich sind die Patties von Rebel Meat mit jenen für Bio- oder Veggie-Burger vergleichbar. „Dass wir es in die Top-10 von greenstart geschafft haben, ist für uns eine Auszeichnung und motiviert uns sehr“, so Stangl. „Wir sind nach wie vor auf der Suche nach weiteren Vertriebspartnerschaften und sind auch offen für gemeinsame Produktentwicklungen.“ Auch „Clean Meat“, also aus Muskelzellen gezüchtetes Fleisch, ist für das Start-up ein wichtiges Thema der Zukunft. Solange die industrielle Fleischproduktion auf dem Markt vorherrsche, müsse man alle Alternativen nutzen, um den ökologischen Fußabdruck zu senken und Tierleid zu verhindern, meint der Firmengründer. Bewusstseinsbildung. Stangl freut sich auch auf potenzielle Kooperationen mit Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen. Rebel Meat-Burger würden gut zu KEM-Events passen. Auch die Abhaltung von Vorträgen oder Workshops – zum Beispiel im Rahmen von Klimaschulen-Projekten – wären für das Rebel Meat-Team vorstellbar.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Rebel-Meat_Fischer_MG_3943-scaled.jpg","30.09.2020","de",0.999561905860901,0.00938471034169197,0.789718866348267,0.00285414885729551,0.198042243719101

Allerdings sind auch die Probleme durch die Überfischung und den ausgeprägten Chemikalien-, und Antibiotikaeinsatz in der industrielle Fischzucht enorm.“ Dazu kommt der energieintensive Transport über weite Stecken, denn über 60 Prozent der in der EU verzehrten Fische werden importiert, der Großteil aus China. Rein pflanzlich. „In jedem Supermarkt findet man vegane und vegetarische ‚Fleischprodukte‘, jedoch kaum pflanzliche Alternativen zu Fisch“, so Simsa. Diese Marktlücke möchte der Jungunternehmer schließen. Wenn alles klappt, könnten die ersten Räucherlachsfilets aus pflanzlichen Proteinen, Ölen und anderen Zutaten ab Herbst 2022 in der Gastronomie serviert werden. In einem weiteren Schritt will Legendary Vish auch im Lebensmittelhandel Fuß fassen. Sehr wichtig ist Simsa die Textur des Produkts: Es soll nicht nur nach Fisch schmecken, sondern auch so aussehen wie ein Fischfilet und sich im Mund danach anfühlen. Im Herbst plant er die Firmengründung und möchte sehr viel Forschungsarbeit in den richtigen Biss des Produkts investieren. Denn bisher wurden 3D-Drucker in der Nahrungsmittelindustrie vor allem für Schokolade oder Teigprodukte eingesetzt, jedoch kaum für innovative Produkte. Innerhalb eines Jahres soll auch der größte Teil der Prototypentwicklung des „Fischfilet-Druckers“ fertig sein. Gründertrio. Simsa studierte Lebensmittel- und Biotechnologie an der Universität für Bodenkultur in Wien. Aktuell arbeitet er in Göteborg an seiner PhD-Arbeit. Die Idee zur Firmengründung entstand gemeinsam mit zwei PhD-KollegInnen, Hakan Gürbüz und Theresa Rothenbücher. Gürbüz bringt Erfahrung im Bereich des 3D-Drucks ein, und Rothenbücher lernte während ihrer Arbeit im Tissue Engineering die Zusammensetzung von Geweben und Organen (also auch Fleisch) zu optimieren. Nun begeben sich die JungunternehmerInnen auf die Suche nach Laborplätzen für fünf bis sechs Personen, nach einer Anschubfinanzierung in der Höhe von 200.000 Euro sowie nach weiteren MitstreiterInnen aus den Bereichen Ernährungswissenschaften und 3D-Druck. „Auch wenn es mit Workshops und Coachings erst losgeht, sind wir jetzt schon von greenstart begeistert“, sagt Simsa. „Dank der bisherigen Öffentlichkeitsarbeit im Rahmen des Programms haben sich bereits mehrere Print- und Onlinemedien, aber auch potenzielle InvestorInnen bei uns gemeldet.“ Von den Klima- und Energie-Modellregionen wünscht sich der Jungunternehmer bei der Bewusstseinsbildungsarbeit auch das Thema Fisch miteinzubeziehen.","https://greenstart.at/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/3-Legendary-Vish.png","30.09.2020","de",0.999046802520752,0.223351925611496,0.73744809627533,0.0301269795745611,0.00907301064580679

Wie stark Medienberichte zum Bekanntheitsgrad beitragen, konnten die meisten Teams bereits erfahren – ob durch TV-Beiträge oder dank der Medienresonanz von greenstart. Wie man die PR-Arbeit weiter professionalisiert und an die richtigen Medien-Kontakte kommt demonstrierten Karin Wiesinger und Dirk Moser von Grayling Austria in der „PR-Session“. Bereit für die zweite Halbzeit Der Nachmittag war den TOP-10 selbst vorbehalten: In knackigen Vorträgen präsentierten die greenstarter ihre Business-Ideen und bisherige Erfolge. Als Experten-Jury gaben Lena Gansterer (Impact Hub Vienna), Christoph Wolfsegger (Programm-Manager Klima- und Energiefonds) und Consultant Werner Krendl konstruktiven Input. So entstand ein Umsetzungs-Fahrplan für die finalen Schritte um jene Ziele zu erreichen, die sich jedes Team zu Beginn des Programmes im März selbst gesteckt hatte.

There are various schools of thought on which of these should come first. Stanford’s Biodesign program teaches the needs-led approach based on early stakeholder engagement. The age-old “Technology Push” approach starts with IP, and often has to search for or establish an unmet need. Starting with people or money is less common. A deeper dive into case studies of successful MedTech societal impact teaches us that we should consider all of these factors as substitutable. You are almost certainly familiar with examples of pivoting a technology to another unmet need, but how do you build a stronger business case by swapping Intellectual Property, People and Money?  More about the guest speaker: Professor James E. Moore Jr., Ph.D. The Bagrit Chair in Medical Device Design Department of Bioengineering Imperial College London Prof. Moore received his PhD in 1991 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, followed by postdoctoral training at the Swiss Institute of Technology at Lausanne, where he also helped set up a new biomedical engineering lab. In January 2013, he joined Imperial College as the Bagrit Chair in Medical Device Design, and started a new masters program in medical device entrepreneurship. To date, eight spinouts have resulted from this program that have attracted more than £4 million in grant and professional investor funding. Prof. Moore is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. Prof. Moore’s research interests include Cardiovascular Biomechanics, Stents, Implantable Devices, Atherosclerosis, and the Lymphatic System. His research focuses on the role of biomechanics in the formation and treatment of diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. His cardiovascular biomechanics research includes the first studies of the effects of stents on both blood flow patterns and artery wall stress. This work resulted in the development of two novel stent designs aimed at optimizing post-implant biomechanics for the prevention of restenosis. He is currently developing two technologies for preventing and resolving secondary lymphedema, which forms subsequent to cancer surgery. Along with his funding from government, charity, and industry sources, Prof. Moore has received multiple patents for medical devices and testing equipment. Prof. Moore has also co-founded two startup companies, with another two about to emerge.","no_image","April 7, 2021","en",0.994486093521118,0.000394594942918047,0.826460421085358,0.00275829993188381,0.170386642217636

The EU Circular Economy Action Plan, alongside the Green Deal, promotes that all products in the EU need to be developed in a sustainable way. This starts with the design for the circularity of products and services but also looking at circular solutions along the entire Value Chain. Looking into circular solutions should become part of the business development of each Spin-off, and it is important to understand that circularity is a lot more than thinking about recyclability. So, quite often the potential of circularity is not explicitly considered when building the business case. In this workshop, you will gather an understanding of which business opportunities exist when applying circular thinking. We will look at tools to identify the potential and how looking into the entire circular value chain can show potential to bring your ideas to an application in business. We will open the minds to see what partners along the circular value chain would need and how you can tap into these opportunities. Based on a case study you will learn how you can use the Circular Canvas to identify solutions by applying good practices of circularity. • Have a good overview of what opportunities for circular business models exist • Know what is required to make your solution more circular • Have experienced working with a powerful tool to activate your team and stakeholders • Get an idea of which steps you can go to further embrace the circular thinking Andreas Ellenberger is Co-Founder and CEO of Circonnact, an organization focusing on the application of circular economy in urban areas, supporting companies and communities to explore, create and implement regenerative circular solutions. For more than 20 years he has been delivering changes successfully in small, medium and large companies and organisations. After graduating in Business Administration at the University of Gießen, Germany, he supported and ran projects and programmes and was IT department lead for a financial services group. 12 years ago, he became a certified project management trainer and developed project governance structures for medium-sized companies and business units. In more than 250 trainings he helped the participants to become well equipped to handle projects and changes with an open mindset and professional methods and tools, always focusing on how to transfer the know-how into the reality of the participants. He organized the collaboration of the Horizon2020 research project Sport Infinity to develop circular sports products and noticed that circular thinking is motivating people to find new innovative solutions and to cooperate. Since 2014 he is actively involved in spreading the ideas of a circular economy, with a focus on how to work in an agile and collaborative way to ensure the implementation is future-proof and based on the contribution of all stakeholders.

Presently HeartGenetics is part of ImpactLab Group. She is also a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Técnico Lisboa (IST), University of Lisbon. She holds a Ph.D. in Computer and Electronic Engineering. She has a degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from Católica School of Business and Economics. As a Professor at IST since 1995, she developed the Computational Biology field. Her scientific expertise is in the areas of Bioinformatics, Nutrigenetics, Human genetics, Health Informatics, Algorithms, and Data Mining.

ELIXIR unites Europe’s leading life science organisations in managing and safeguarding the increasing volume of data being generated by publicly-funded research. The Talk will focus on: The engineers abroad: adventures of an entrepreneur in the hostile lands of personalized medicine Personalized medicine is nowadays more than a buzzword, as it has become a vision that can be realized by building tools, interventions and products tailored to the individual person or patient, based on their predicted response or potential risk of disease. A field with this description looks like the perfect space for engineers to intervene. This is particularly true if we think that any business around this topic should use digital technologies in order to be scalable and attract investment. Alas, things are not so simple and reality differs from this perception. In this talk, I will present the work that, as an engineer, I have been developing at HeartGenetics, in the difficult field of personalized and preventive medicine. I will describe the adventure of moving from academia to the industry and how difficult it is to guarantee the convergence of several key factors: the engineer’s vision of a new medical product, the soundness of the underlying science, the need for patient-oriented medical practice, and, finally, the standardization and process efficiency needed to achieve scale and attract investors.

They share their international experiences, dos and don’ts and lessons learned during inspiring talks and answer questions in interactive Q&A-sessions.   More about Stefan Nagel Stefan is a Partner at Round2. He Joined Jan, Christian and Isabella at Round2 after spending more than ten years at McKinsey & Company advising clients in the telecommunications and high-tech sectors on strategy and corporate finance topics including large transactions and transformations, and also in particular how fact-based steering and financial planning drives key decisions and ongoing operational management. During this time, Stefan developed a passion for technology-driven products and their value generation impact on the economy overall and in the shaping of “how life works” in societies across the world. Working with large corporates, he built a perspective on how large cooperations work, how smaller and younger companies can work with these organizations and what structures and processes need to be build when scaling businesses. He brings this experience to bear in the identification and evaluation of potential candidates for Round2 financing and in working with our portfolio companies as they continue on their growth path. Besides Round2, Stefan is engaged as business angel, helping early-stage companies to build their pre-dominantly B2B software businesses. Born in Germany, Stefan lives with his wife and two sons in Vienna. He has a degree in business from WHU – Otto-Beisheim Graduate School, Vallendar and spent parts of his studies in the US and in Russia.   More about Round2 Capital Partners Round2 is a financing partner for European scale-ups with digital and sustainable business models. In the scale-up phase, outstanding entrepreneurs manage to transform their business from a successful venture into a real company. Round2 offers the innovative funding instruments and insights needed to master this transformation process. Founded in 2017, Round2 has pioneered revenue-based finance in Europe: a flexible, non-dilutive funding instrument.   The Talk will focus on… A study evaluating 3,200 high growth internet startups showed that 74% of ventures which failed, did this due to premature scaling. Therefore, we asked ourselves, how can startups create actual value and consequently build sustainable business models to avoid this trap? Heads up – there are no such things as checklists which will guarantee the success of a venture! However, working with over 20 European tech scale-ups provided us with valuable insights on what it means to build businesses sustainably. During this session, we will introduce you to our learnings and findings on how to think about value creation and how this translates into a venture’s sustainable growth. Moreover, we will show you why the different approaches of value creation ask for different financing solutions. Last but not least, we will share with you why we, Round2 Capital, pioneered revenue-based finance in the European funding ecosystem since 2017, and how it fits into the big picture of sustainable business building. ——————————————- *** During the event, photographic and video material will be taken.

They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary co-founder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls “the torture.” Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. Great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, “I didn’t quit.” ‘’ Ben Horowitz, author The Hard Thing About Hard Things Being a first-time founder has its blessings and its courses. During this session, we want to talk about the realistic goals of embarking on the exciting and challenging journey of starting your first business. Especially if you have been working in the academia for the past years and you want right now to make the leap and start your own company based on your research results, you will have a better experience starting a spinout if you are armed with some expectations about your likely journey. Spinning-out requires a clear time and usually also money commitment, and its success highly depends on the founder team’s passion, irrational optimism and deep faith the technology they’ve developed. From writing their first business plan to their first investment and scaling up, 4 founders from 4 different TU Wien- affiliated companies in different stages share their experience with transforming their research into successful products or services. At the end of the workshop you will:  Guests: Nermina Mumic – CEO & founder Legitary Nermina graduated with honours from Vienna University of Technology with a master’s degree in Technical Mathematics. After her studies she gained profound experience as a data scientist in a leading global IT consulting company, developing AI solutions for various industry applications.

Based on her research results, she founded Legitary GmbH as a spin-off from Vienna University of Technology. Legitary is the winner of the world’s leading music startup competition Midemlab.

In the special case of establishing a university spin-out, the number of founders is likely to be higher, the team members fulfill various roles and have a different level of commitment to the day-to-day running of the company. As a provider of resources and permissions, you can expect the university to become a significant shareholder as well. Splitting the equity equally among university and/or founder researchers might be detrimental to the spin-out in the long-run. So how to make sure everyone gets his / her fair share of equity? This workshop covers important topics like the size of the shareholding, how to split founder equity dos and don’ts and possible consequences, how to tackle founders who don’t commit 100% or want to continue their academic path as well as provide you with some tools to ease the process of splitting the founder’s pie. At the end of the workshop you will: Guest Lecturer Lucanus is Founder and Managing Partner of Calm/Storm Ventures, a founder network and boutique venture capital firm based in Vienna, Austria.

Babett Kürschner People need to be aware that what they see on social media isn’t necessarily real.Nicole Chan, 22, on how edited social media posts can influence users’ self-esteem. The impact of social media on its users’ mental health has been a topic of interest for years but has become even more relevant in the midst of the current pandemic. As the usage of messenger apps and social media platforms is going up, tech founders can draw important conclusions for their own startups from studying the steps of established companies like Facebook when it comes to the impact of their technology on users’ well-being. For this week’s Responsible Tech Insights, we are focusing on the effects people’s online presence has on our life away from the screen. We spoke with Nicole Chan, who gathered an online following of close to 4,000 followers through showcasing her makeup looks. After grappling with the negative aspects of being a public persona, she decided to deactivate her account to take a two-year break from social media platforms. Nicole Chan, 22, is currently living in London, United Kingdom. Source: Instagram @whichnicole Let’s start at the beginning: what were your first experiences with social media platforms? My first experience with social media… I think I must have been eight when I registered on Facebook. Actually, it wasn’t even me who signed up, my mother created an account for me so she could add me as a friend. I didn’t use the platform until maybe a few years later. I was around twelve when I started posting quite frankly random pictures and status updates. It wasn’t anything like today where hundreds of “friends” see your posts, it was mostly family and people I knew in real life I was connected with anyways. It was a completely different time back then. Social media is an entirely other environment today. For example when I downloaded Instagram as a young teen I thought it was a photo editing app at first. The app was fairly new back then and I assumed the main feature was the filters you could apply to your images. What I didn’t know was that every time I edited and saved pictures, I was simultaneously posting them publicly on my profile. I only realised my feed was public after one of my friends eventually commented on one of my posts. It might seem silly now but that’s how much of an uncharted territory social media was back then. Ah, that’s tricky. Do you recall any other negative experiences? Well, as teenagers we started using messaging apps. MSN Messenger was very popular in Macau, an autonomous region on the south coast of China, which is where I’m from. But at one point some of us also registered on American dating websites, we must have been around thirteen at the time. We used fake profiles of course and were essentially trolling people, pretending to be somebody else. Looking back it was clearly reckless but none of us really thought it was dangerous at the time. We also had a “Gossip Girl” copycat in Macau. They anonymously posted private details in a very harsh way on their Facebook page, just like in the TV series. Even years later we don’t know who was behind the account, though my friends and I have a hunch. Thankfully I was never written about but a lot of my friends got mentioned. Their names were slightly changed but we all knew who the posts were about. There was a post about somebody I knew who had broken up with their boyfriend but ended up sleeping with his best friend. Very standard teenage drama. But it was posted publicly on Facebook, for everybody to see, the next day. It must have been incredibly humiliating for her, especially since somebody she knew well probably sent in the tip. This was a while ago and at this point, we’re using social media in a completely different way of course. Today I’d say we mainly see these platforms as a way to build our reputation and portray ourselves to others in a certain way. And a lot of times this environment can get quite toxic too, I’m not going to lie. We asked Nicole to edit one of tech2impact’s team members to demonstrate the stark contrast between altered and unaltered photos. Source: Babett KürschnerWhat features of social media contribute to this environment in your opinion? For me, I^d definitely say it’s the addictiveness of it. For example, when I meet people in real life and follow them on social media later, I keep checking if they follow me back and get a bit anxious if they don’t. It’s like some sort of stamp of approval. Did they really enjoy talking to me if they don’t follow me back? Actually, this is a good indicator of how seriously people take themselves online. If they follow me back instantly they’re usually great to communicate and connect with, they’re more carefree about their image online. But the ones who take their time tend to be more shallow and see it more from a cost-benefit perspective. It can be genuinely exhausting and experiences like these led me to decide to take down my profile for about two years. Could you tell me a bit more about the reasons behind shutting your account down? So, it was mostly the pressure to keep up with creating better and better content. I was constantly trying to one-up myself, even though I’m not even an influencer with hundreds of thousands of followers. I felt under pressure and it simply wasn’t enjoyable anymore. I got incredibly fed up with it. I switched to using an account where I only followed my closest fifty friends. I hardly posted anything there, it was mainly to keep in touch with them. At first, a lot of people didn’t understand why I would deactivate my account if I had a lot of followers but it was never about that, metrics didn’t actually matter to me. But you re-activated your account again, right? What has changed in your approach to social media since then? Yes, I did. At this point when I scroll through my feed and see other people’s perfect bodies it doesn’t matter to me anymore. I’m way less likely to be negatively influenced by it because I gained perspective and know that what I’m seeing online probably isn’t real anyways. I use apps like FaceTune, I know how to get the perfect body, the perfect face. One swipe here, one swipe there… Speaking of, I actually edit my photos way less than I used to too. I started feeling more confident about my body. Nowadays I only add a subtle natural filter with a skin-smoothing feature and maybe slim my jaw a bit. Models on billboards have been edited by professional photographers for decades. The only difference now is that it’s relatively easy to access and use these editing tools. “A lot of times makeup looks just won’t show up on camera without editing.” Source: Instagram @whichnicoleWhat’s your take on photo editing apps like FaceTune in general? I think it’s important for users to know how widely these filters are used on social media nowadays. I have a disclaimer on my profile where I clearly state how edited my pictures are. The way I look in my posts isn’t how I actually look. But if you don’t know that’s the case, you’re bound to compare yourself to an unrealistic beauty standard. I’ve had friends come up to me to tell me that they deleted Instagram because it made them feel horrible. It made them think they needed to drastically change their looks and it really wasn’t healthy for them. But online platforms shouldn’t have such a negative influence on their users. You should open an app and feel motivated or happy, not insecure about yourself. Anything else you’d like to say to wrap up our conversation? I think people need to be aware that everything they see online is very superficial. What they see online isn’t necessarily real. Everybody’s putting out the best version of themselves, nobody’s an exception. If you look at your own profile you’re most likely creating a curated picture for others to see. At the end of the day what matters most when you use these platforms is how you feel afterwards. Social media should make you feel good. It should be used to connect with people, to raise awareness of important issues, to keep in touch with friends from all over the world. Technology should add something positive to your life. Period. Because if it doesn’t, what’s the point of using it in the first place?

"https://tech2impact.com/connecting-the-unconnected/","Tech2Impact","Connecting the unconnected"," Connecting the unconnected “Let’s create something valuable.” Jorge Rios Bridgefy Born in Mexico Living in USA Focus: Digital Divide Tech: SDK Jorge met his co-founders at an international hackathon in a team, where they together represented Mexico. As they were the only team not having access to wifi, on the way to the hackathon, they came up with the idea of building a product – an app – that will work without the internet. A few years later, this idea became a company called Bridgefy. What is Bridgefy? Bridgefy is connecting the unconnected by providing companies with software that makes mobile apps work without the internet. We license our software to companies and they can integrate it into their mobile apps and the end-users then simply can use those without the internet. The way it works is instead of using the internet, we connect devices using Bluetooth and thus allow for a regional and national network. With Bluetooth, you can connect over 150 meters and by hopping on other devices, we can also connect over larger distances. It’s basically a chain of devices that allows for communication without having access to the internet. Everything is secure and Bluetooth is also very energy efficient. In which parts of the world is your app used mostly? Or on which occasions? Right now we are trending in India, because of the Kashmir conflicts. Last year, we were trending in Mexico City because of the earthquake and then in Iran and Hong Kong because of the political protests. These are some examples, but I would say that generally when people know that they’re going to be in a large event, that’s when they think of Bridgefy. And it’s not only for political events but also for music festivals. We have a lot of download spikes whenever there’s going to be a large music festival, like Coachella. What about regions with generally bad access, like some rural areas, is this an area of interest? It definitely is. We actually met with the United Nations this year and we hope to be starting several projects with them in which we help people in the developing regions. We know that we can promote economic and social development with our technology. If people are able to buy or sell things, have a network for logistics or receive educational content – this can make the difference and boost development. We can provide people with this infrastructure in an accessible and easy way and we know that we can make a difference. So we’re really excited about what’s going to happen in this regard. What is your connection to the Sustainable Development Goals? Bridgefy’s technology addresses multiple development goals, including the reduction of poverty, the creation of infrastructure and to boost economic growth. If we create this network and provide people with tools, then it will allow them to address several problems. We’re not focused on just one goal, we’re focused on providing people with the infrastructure to solve as many problems as possible. This includes doing a better job or finding a job, being able to participate in commerce, receive educational content, and staying safe during natural disasters or a refugee camp. That’s why we’re really convinced we are a perfect partner for the United Nations, as the majority of their agenda is aligned with ours. What do you think is or was your biggest challenge as a founder? This year, the biggest challenge was adapting to all the COVID-19 changes. Now people don’t go to events or protests, so downloads went down significantly. We had to learn, investigate, and adapt to this and find new ways of managing the company. We saw that we can’t just keep depending on large events, as they won’t be happening anytime soon. Our biggest problem still is that many people, especially with a privileged background, don’t believe that this is a problem we’re trying to solve. They don’t know that so many people need access to means of communication. They think that everybody has access to the internet, always, because they do. That’s something that we’re constantly trying to educate people on. We have to raise awareness so that people understand how important and how needed this is for everybody. What do you love most about being the founder of Bridgefy? My favorite thing is to get feedback from the app users, especially when they say things like “Thanks to this app, I was able to go to this concert and I lost my girlfriend and I found her again” or “Thanks to this app, l could find my family, after the Mexico City earthquake”. When receiving this feedback, I’m getting that sense of actually helping people and this is definitely my favorite part. What was your best moment as a founder? I would say convincing Biz Stone, one of the Twitter founders, to invest in Bridgefy. He is the high technology world superstar and has already built several million dollar companies and is invested in Slack, Square, and many more. Convincing somebody important is a really cool experience. I like counting on him as one of our investors and one of our advisors. What is also very important to me is being able to build a team that I like working with every day and being able to keep that team. Do you have some established habits or routines with your team to have a good team culture? Yes. Every day we check-in at 9 am on Slack to know how everybody is doing and if anyone needs help with anything. I also encourage my team to be honest and say if they don’t feel like it. Everyone should be able to express it and not having to hide anything. Some days you just simply don’t want to work and that’s totally okay, we’re humans, we’re adults. Another thing we do at least once a week is having a face to face meeting to check on how the person is doing. That’s not so much about the job, because we talk the whole week about the job. It’s more about questions like “How are you? How’s your family? How are you feeling? Is there anything you need?” You know, taking care of the human part of the company is very important. Generally, I would say a lot of communication and honesty is the key. Did you establish any habits or routines for yourself as a founder? Yes. I learned that listening to your body and paying attention to your mind is very important. You can’t just keep working 14 hours a day, every day. If your body is asking you to rest, eat, sleep, or to simply stop thinking about work, you have to listen to it. Because in the long run it will accumulate and you can be seriously affected. You should never sacrifice your well-being for a company. Yes, you have to put all of your heart into it and you have to put all of your attention to it if you can, but not to the point where you can affect yourself on a personal basis. That’s just not worth it. What is your advice for future founders? So, in my opinion, there are two types of founders: the ones building companies to get money and the others to create value. The founders that create companies to make money don’t always succeed, but if you create value, then you are doing exactly the right thing to then earn money. If you create value for different people, organizations, companies or governments, then it’s much easier to make money once you’ve become an essential part of their lives/work. Whereas if you only create a company to make money, then yes, of course, you can be successful and of course, you could do it, but there are easier and faster ways of getting rich than building a tech startup. If you create value, then wealth will follow. So, let’s create something valuable.

"https://tech2impact.com/from-science-fiction-to-life-sustaining-organs/","Tech2Impact","From science fiction to life-sustaining organs"," From science fiction to life-sustaining organs “I am totally convinced that this technology is going to be normal in a decade or two.” Lutz Kloke Cellbricks Born in Germany Living in Germany Focus: Health Tech: Bioprinting Lutz is by training a pharmacist, but by some weird coincidence he ended up doing his Ph.D. in tissue engineering. The work on his thesis made him go deeper into the topic and finding his passion for bioprinting. After finishing his thesis he was sold on the idea of printing implantable material and providing bioimplants. So he turned his hobby and interests into a company – Cellbricks. What is Cellbricks? Our mission is to solve the organ donor shortage by bioprinting transplants. We have developed a new bioprinting technology that allows us to create complex three-dimensional structures made of biopolymers and cells. With this, we can produce organ-models, living 3D cell cultures, and scaffolds. Additionally, we are also aiming to empower researchers to investigate functional human tissues for fundamental biological research or advanced regenerative therapies. How did you come up with the idea of Cellbricks? It’s basically the same startup story like with everybody else: you start with a hobby/field of interest and make it your primary work – or at least this is how I ended up with Cellbricks. After my Ph.D. thesis, I had nothing, I just had my degree. If I would have gone to the banks and told them “look, I want to do bioprinting because I think this is the future and we are gonna print organs or transplants” I wouldn’t have gotten any funding. But the good thing is that the German government gives funding to deep tech ideas that you want to commercialize. So, in 2015 I started with Cellbricks and in 2016 I was able to found the legal entity. Since then we are working as a bioprinting company, selling printed products and working as a collaborator for academia, hospitals, and for the industry. We basically build them their individual 3-dimensional models. That’s the short story of how Cellbricks started and we grew ever since – we started off with three people in 2015 and right now we are 15. But honestly, that’s the question I get always asked and it’s the hardest one to answer. The weird part is that I am just totally convinced that this technology is going to be normal in a few years or a decade. This science-fiction idea of going to the doctor and he/she is going to print an organ or life material and implant it into your body will be reality sooner or later. Also, we will get used to the fact that it’s better to create something new than to implant plastic or material that is derived from animals. I am entirely sold on that idea, but it’s hard to explain how I came up with it at the very beginning. I worked in the field, and to me, it was obvious that 3D printing would advance to printing biological material, and if I wouldn’t do it, somebody else would do it. I guess it kinda grows with you when you work in the field and you get passionate about it, right? Did you ever plan to found a company? How is it to be a founder? I actually decided to found a company because it was the only way to keep working in the field after my PhD. Now I’m my own boss, I can decide how we move and I love this. But on the other hand, I still need to focus on getting money, so basically, the economic situation is my boss (laughs). This means that I cannot really completely freely decide where to go because I’m also responsible to get revenue. As a founder, there are many fields to take care of – building up a company, developing the technology, finding customers, getting revenue, and so on. You have to balance the company between economic and scientific growth – we cannot act as a pure R&D company, as we are an economic entity that sells its products. What was your best moment and biggest learning as a founder until now? I guess there is no specific “best moment”. It just makes me really happy whenever I think of our journey and remember where we came from and what we have accomplished so far. It’s a good feeling. And my biggest learning I would say was to learn to say “No” to people or projects in order to stay focused. Where do you see Cellbricks in 5 years from now? In 5 years I want us to be an established player in the field of regenerative medicine via bioprinting. That is basically the goal I’m looking towards. I want us to grow into a company that is on the one hand advancing science (especially in drug development) and on the other hand, is exploring the way on how we can use the technology to speed up regenerative medicine. What do you think in which timeframe is it realistic to have 3D printed organs? It’s hard to estimate how long it will take. Due to regulations, it will take a while – especially life-sustaining organs like a beating heart or liver. It’s not like you are allowed to implant something into the body just because you can print it, there are a lot of regulations and this is good. You need to pass many tests before and this will take years to decades. I don’t have a clear date for when there will be the first life-sustaining organ ready to be implanted. But implantable material, which is not life-sustaining, I think this will take place sooner. So to conclude, to implant a printed beating heart will still take time, but there will be devices or material that will be implanted for sure in this decade.

"https://tech2impact.com/improvement-of-lives-as-an-imperative/","Tech2Impact","Improvement of lives as an imperative"," Improvement of lives as an imperative “The best moments are always when someone’s life improves by using your product” Louis Zantema Reducept Born in The Netherlands Living in The Netherlands Focus: Chronic Pain Tech: Virtual Reality Louis Zantema is a Doctor of Psychology and most likely the only specialist whose aim is to make himself dispensable as a therapist. His company Reducept unites his passion for gaming with his passion for improving his patients’ lives through evidence based psychological and educational interventions, redesigned for Virtual Reality. What is Reducept and how was the idea born? Reducept is a non-medical virtual reality therapy for people with chronic pain. I worked as a psychologist in hospitals for many years, mainly in chronic pain wards. I met my Co-Founder Margryt Fennema at The Medical Center Leeuwarden and we started out by identifying what type of patients are running into difficulties at the hospital. Margryt and I realised that if there’s a group that’s really hard to treat, it’s victims of chronic pain. There are so many people who suffer from it and it’s not really a well-known issue in wider society. 40% of all loss of work worldwide is due to lower back pain. That’s huge! What we noticed when we spoke with patients is that a lot of them had a really similar disease pattern. Most people with chronic pain we spoke to didn’t have physical reasons for their pain. They found it really hard to grasp why they were hurting and how to move forward with their therapy because they were sort of at the last stop. In most cases, medication or surgery didn’t help anymore. Margryt and I saw this really big group of people with a problem that was hard to solve, so we decided to do something about it. How did you come up with your approach? Well, we did a lot of testing and experimented with offering therapeutic exercises and education on websites, in apps – and eventually in virtual reality too. The interesting thing about VR is that it captivates its users and we were quite astonished that this was the case even for chronic pain patients, who usually struggle with their attention span due to the medication they take. After noticing that it was much easier for them to learn and grasp things in VR we got really excited and other people got excited too, which is how we managed to raise our first round of funds and subsidies to create the prototype. We had some ideas on what types of exercises to implement. I was treating patients with chronic pain at the hospital so I knew from experience what tactics worked especially well. But in-person treatment is an incredibly slow process. It would take me 15 or 20 hours to have one patient, well, up and running so to speak. After a lot of positive feedback for our prototype from patients we started to raise more money through startup competitions, other subsidies and an investor. Our MVP was ready by September last year and Reducept launched as a B2B business in the Netherlands. Could you walk us through one of the VR exercises? We’re applying a lot of different mental strategies that could help patients to cope with their pain. All of our exercises have different theoretical backgrounds. There’s an exercise where you first choose the spot where you feel pain, enter your own nervous system and “shoot” at your own pain, the gamification aspect here is really important. This exercise will actually influence the part of your brain that is responsible for creating that pain in the first place. Just by doing this exercise and sort of “tricking” their brain, our patients’ pain scores drop and stay low for a long period of time. We also have relaxation and cognitive exercises and we’re working towards adding mindfulness activities to train patients to not focus on their pain all the time. What is it like being a founder for you? I think I’d describe myself as an “unintentional founder”. I was really happy with working as a psychologist but then this opportunity came along. Helping patients through Reducept gave me so much energy that I decided to just go with it. To be honest, I don’t think being a founder is more or less special than running a business or being a freelancer. I’m still doing something that is related to psychology, even though it is completely different from being a psychologist at a hospital. You can create an impact in so many different ways and it’s up to you to decide how you want to do it. What were your biggest challenges and your best moments so far? Biggest challenge… That’s a hard one. I think the biggest challenge was finding the right people to work with. We have a team of 14 and finding the right people doesn’t only mean finding somebody with the right skill set but also with the right focus and dedication. This also applies to investors and other stakeholders, everybody needs to have the same goal in mind.In the long run, we wouldn’t want investors to conflict with our purpose for example. Investors are always looking to make money and money is nice, don’t get me wrong! But it shouldn’t be the biggest focus of your company. The best moments are always when someone’s life improves by using your product after all. Luckily we have many of these moments. We sometimes get emails from patients, one even published a whole article in a patient magazine detailing how our technology helped them. Things like these are what drive us, it’s still sort of a surprise sometimes but it never gets old. Do you have any habits that help you stay on top of things? Yeah, I think it’s really important to prioritize tasks when you build your company. It’s really easy to get caught up in doing things that don’t actually benefit your end goal. So if you’re stuck and don’t have time to work on and improve your product anymore, you should take a look at your processes and find out what’s hindering you from moving forward. Focus is super important, you have to decide what has to be done and what your priorities are for example. In my case, I often ask myself if what I’m doing helps someone with chronic pain or not in the long run. For example, I feel like writing blog posts is sort of a drag and it might be easier to put it off and call somebody from our team to discuss stuff about MailChimp instead. Think of what helps develop your purpose. In my case, it’s creating content so I’d be better off focusing on that. Is this also something that’s reflected in your company culture? Yes definitely, I think we’re really focused as a group. The most important aspect about our team is that everybody really wants to help our end-user – people with chronic pain. It’s the same for our clients too. They buy Reducept because they want to improve their own pain or want to treat their patients, not necessarily to make money fast. Of course, you can profit from Reducept but if you work in healthcare it’s primarily about improving the lives of people. All startups in this industry care about doing research and improving medical technology to some extent. Where do you see yourself and Reducept in the next three years? I hope that in a couple of years we’ll be known as the best online treatment for chronic pain worldwide. I also think that utilising VR definitely has its limits and I’m curious what the future is going to hold for our treatments’ integrations in augmented reality and smartphone devices. Do you have any advice for founders that are at the very beginning of their journey? I think the best advice is still to find a group that really has a need, you can read up on this in many books. Create something completely different and don’t just improve an existing product or service. Find a gap you can fill and identify your target audience. I would also advise everybody to really think about their organisational goals and make sure they are truly worth striving for. If you want to do something for many years you have to find value in it, otherwise I believe it won’t work. In my opinion one of the things you should also really be focusing on as a startup is trying to sell the product you have as soon as possible. Last year we did a lot of pre-sales based on our prototype, we went to practices and told them about its potential. I know that some startups are less focused on sales and more focused on getting more subsidies and funding. It’s a shame because if you test out the saleability of your product too late, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to get feedback from your customers from an early stage. Do you have any recommendations for our readers? “The Courage To Be Disliked” by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi and most stuff from Seth Godin, especially his podcast or book. He’s all about purpose as well. It’s about making slow progress instead of applying some magic trick and believing you can instantly change your habits and achieve success.

"https://tech2impact.com/sdg-3-good-health-and-well-being-using-tech-to-drive-global-health-forward/","Tech2Impact","SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being: Using Tech to Drive Global Health Forward"," SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being: Using Tech to Drive Global Health Forward Sarah Klimt tech2impact On the occasion of World Health Day, this year’s theme focuses on building a fairer and healthier world. Indeed, the COVID-19 continues to be a challenge for humanity, but it has also revealed deeper underlying issues, namely the inequalities in global health. There is no doubt that the pandemic’s impact has adversely affected all of us, especially those who have already been vulnerable before the crisis are facing the brunt of the pandemic. Vulnerability comes in all forms, such as inadequate access to, or lack of, healthcare services and factors outside the health sector. Low income, lack of safe environments, clean water, nutritious food, and many more, can also affect good health adversely. Truly, the crisis has shown how an individual’s socio-economic background plays a decisive role in accessing healthcare services. For this reason, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is urging leaders to tackle such inequalities by: Encouraging a bottom-up approach, promoting collaborative work between affected communities and the governments to tackle inequalities collectively.Collecting reliable health data, which in turn allows for better decision-making, making sure that taken actions have an impact.Ensuring that the governmental approach addresses the root cause of inequities and direct funds in primary healthcare.Enhancing international mechanisms to guarantee equitable access to vaccines, tests, and treatments.Implications of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Good Health and Well-Being Looking at the global progress of the Sustainable Development Goal 3 across critical areas such as child health, maternal health, HIV, immunisations have been compelling. The last two decades have seen an improvement in reducing neonatal deaths, under 5-child mortalities and reduced maternal mortalities (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 (Source: WHO Statistics) However, COVID-19 continues to threaten existing healthcare systems and discourage routine health check-ups with catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, current emphasis needs to be directed towards accelerating global health to counteract the adverse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. “According to a recent study, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased, the increase in child and maternal deaths could be devastating: 118 low- and middle-income countries could see an increase of 9.8 to 44.8% in under-5 deaths per month and an 8.3 to 38.6% rise in maternal deaths per month, over a period of six months.”SDG Progress Report 2020 Also, around 70 countries have halted their childhood immunisation programs due to the pandemic. WHO statistics indicate a global increase in non-transmissible diseases, like diabetes, regardless of whether it is an emerging or established economy, leading to the majority of global deaths per year. In this sense, promoting the uptake of technology can be an essential force to target the eroding state of healthcare systems caused by the pandemic. Let’s take a closer look at it in the next section. Uptake of Technology to Make Healthcare Accessible Virtual health applications have been made available for more than a decade ago. But their uptake has been relatively slow in the healthcare industry. Due to the pandemic, more investments have gone into virtual health technologies, thus challenging traditional approaches. In terms of investment, in 2019, digital health was a global market of around $350 billion. Virtual health applicationshave been categorised across three categories: telehealth, digital therapeutics, and care navigation. Research suggests that virtual health applications are bound to receive increased investments, with remote monitoring being a prominent focus area for future investments (Figure 2). Figure 2 (Source: McKinsey, 2020)It is not surprising that virtual health adoption is receiving more attention as their applications create opportunities such as: Offering new high-quality services to patients, especially for elderly patients and those patients suffering from chronic illnesses. Findings suggest that virtual health is perceived to be a convenient and cost-effective way to access healthcare services.Accessing new markets across different geographical areas – for example, extending healthcare services to rural areas.Our tech2impact ecosystem startups use diverse tech approaches, from robotics, telehealth to digital platforms and many more to enable SDG 3.

The platform provides an integrated teleconsultation option, which, together with the other features, allows for better engagement between patients and doctors. The need for responsible tech to avoid amplifying inequalities As much as technology is needed to drive global health forward, the role of responsible technology to avoid pitfalls can’t be understated. This year’s World Health Day theme, building a fairer and healthier world, can be achieved with the help of digital health technologies. The general consensus highlights the role of technologies enabling better healthcare access to marginalised or rural communities, the elderly, and those suffering from chronic illnesses. However, a critical aspect to consider is not to fall into the trap of believing technology alone will advance health equity. First, we need to take the complex socio-economic and socio-cultural structures and other factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender into consideration before developing technological solutions. Second, we then need to provide a technological solution that does not overlook these aspects and include them in their strategic and planning processes. For example, not recognising a contextual factor such as the problem of race blind data across digital health applications, can leads to systematic discrimination in digital healthcare services. Context is key – in life and in Good Health and Well-Being Essentially, the aim is to use tech to empower all patients and not exacerbate existing inequities in the health sector. We can succeed in this aim by placing importance on contextual analysis. An approach that helps to understand the importance of local knowledge is to use community-based participatory research. In this respect, scholars have highlighted the importance of involving marginalised communities, researchers, and tech innovators by advocating for community engagement practices. At tech2impact, we are keen to promote tech with a purpose. Together, with the Institute for Technological Ethics, we have developed the Responsible Tech Assessment. The test allows you to identify and position your startup across different areas such as business and technological ethics, health, social, and democratic risks within the larger network of social-cultural understanding. To gain in-depth insights on your performance across the listed areas make sure to take the assessment.

Least of all social networks that deliberately try to attract users that have been banned or shunned on other platforms due to their disruptive and counterproductive behaviour. We’re talking about Parler, a so-called alt-tech platform whose star fell as quickly as it rose in 2020. Initially, the platform proclaimed to be a “safe space” (or rather echo chamber) where users could express their opinions without regulations or censorship. But Parler fell victim to social risks that have afflicted the fate of many other alternative social networks across all political and ideological spectrums: anti-social behaviour and hijacking by bad actors. While Parler, a hotbed for xenophobia, antisemitism and right-wing extremism, might not be a prime example of technology acting responsibly towards society, there is a lot to be learned from its struggle to prevent diminishing trust and confidence in their product. Parler is imploding. pic.twitter.com/tmfk52666q— Parlertakes<U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> (@parlertakes) December 14, 2020An example of the content that can be found on Parler. Source: Twitter (@parlertakes)Sounds interesting but what exactly is Parler? Parler is “a non-biased free speech-driven entity” founded by two computer scientists, John Matze and Jared Thomson. It received its funding from angel investors like the prominent conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, as it doesn’t display any ads and is not profitable as of now. From a UX standpoint, it’s similar to Twitter with posts that can be shared (or “echoed”), rated and commented on. Its mission statement to “enable productive, polite discourse among people with differing interests, life experiences, and viewpoints” is in strong contrast to Parlor’s active users, who are overwhelmingly right-leaning and to some extent radicalised. The network is most popular in the Americas, the U.S. and Brazil to be more specific. However, it had initially caught on in the Middle East and in Europe too. At one point, conservative members of the British parliament romped about alongside anti-government extremists and QAnon conspiracy theorists. Parler is often mentioned in the same breath as other alt-tech platforms that cater to right-wing communities such as 4chan. Why did it become so popular then? The emergence of alternative social media networks is fueled by users’ increasing dissatisfaction with existing platforms. The messaging app Telegram gained popularity by explicitly emphasising its focus on privacy and data encryption features, that WhatsApp is reportedly struggling to implement. In a similar way, Parler saw a steep increase in user registrations after Twitter changed its policy towards the tweets of the current U.S. President Donald Trump. While adding a flair about disputed facts seems like a drop in the ocean of stopping the spread of misinformation to some, to others this was enough to boycott the platform and switch to Parler – at least temporarily. Its community guidelines are fairly short. They emphasise Parler’s minimal involvement in monitoring and removing content, something that definitely appealed to an audience disgruntled by their perceived censorship through bigger tech companies. The chronological layout of users’ feeds was seen as a positive contrast to sometimes untransparent algorithms of other platforms that favour certain posts without any real explanation. Creators on platforms such as Instagram accuse the tech giant of bias and censorship every time a new algorithm update is rolled out. By displaying posts in the exact order they were released Parler tried to circumvent this issue.. I can’t get past the captcha! Anyone know a fix? Beyond frustrating..I’ve tried on iPhone, pc and the app <U+0001F92C>A quote from a disgruntled Parler user who struggles with some of its features. Source: “Who Is Moving To Parler?” Facebook group So, where did it go wrong? Firstly, proclaiming oneself as a safe haven for individuals who have been banned from conventional social networking sites due to their breach of community guidelines set the tone for the type of discourse to come. Secondly, Parler fell victim to something tech2impact and The Institute of Technological Ethics describe as “social risks”: the consequences of bad actors using technology in unintended and harmful ways. There are 2 key social risks that lead users to turn away from alternative social networks, including Parler. Anti-social behaviour One of the main reasons Parler has taken a hit with its user base is the various reports of high-profile QAnon figures being impersonated on the platform. QAnon is a (disproven) far-right conspiracy theory, driven by anonymous leaders who post regular “updates” on fringe websites. An administrator of one of these websites has publicly spoken out about Parler, as somebody had created a verified profile on his behalf, pretending to be him. Another example was the fake profile of right-wing English media personality Katie Hopkins. After she was banned from Twitter for violating their policies, an account claiming to be Hopkins was set up and quickly verified on Parler. This account went on to raise $500 for a supposed lawsuit against Twitter that was of course fabricated. The CEO of Parler ended up publicly apologizing and verifying the real Katie Hopkins himself, but at that point, users had already begun to become suspicious of the platform. Bad actors & hijacking Letting misinformation and conspiracy theories spread might have been one of the core USPs of Parler. But the same practices that were put in place to “ensure free speech” (i.e. not using algorithms but volunteers to filter content) lead Parler to be susceptible to third parties utilising the platform for their own gains. Reportedly, the platform is an easy target for the spam of pornographic material of actors using the site to promote their own services. Mechanisms that should disable auto-play of videos seem to not always work, which leads to users being confronted with graphic imagery they might not necessarily want to see. Another example: MeWe, a different alt-tech network is currently grappling with the hijacking of their platform by gun and drug dealers. Their mission statement was to give “the power of the internet back to the people”. Hey @GregAbbott_TX! This dude is saying stuff on Parler. <U+270C><U+FE0F> pic.twitter.com/guvMdDJMQW— Parlertakes<U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> (@parlertakes) December 14, 2020A conservative politician campaigning on Parler. Source: Twitter (@parlertakes)With that being said, what are the implications of all this for tech founders? Technology founders who set out to create alternative social media platforms amongst the quasi-monopolists Facebook, YouTube and Twitter need to be extremely careful to not create something even more harmful. Creating an environment that adds value and not harm to their users lives can be a tightrope to walk. The implications of social risks are detrimental to users’ wellbeing, self-esteem and mental health. While bigger companies like Apple and Microsoft have their fair share of controversies with regards to this, their operations are more robust due to size and experience. Startups’ reputation and performance on the other hand can be heavily affected by even just one incident. Without taking social risks into account, tech companies are vulnerable to anti-social behavior and bad actors that can taint the experience of their users. When it comes to Parler, these and other factors are leading to the erosion of meaningful interaction and a drastic slowdown of their growth (which definitely isn’t a bad thing, all things considered). But regardless of Parler’s twisted business model and mission statement from the get-go, there are valuable lessons to be learned for startup founders about the need to plan ahead for social risks of all sorts. If you want to find out more about your startup’s status quo when it comes to social risks and other topics such as business ethics or socio-cultural understanding, take the Responsible Technology Assessment here – it only takes 15 minutes!

"https://tech2impact.com/tackling-climate-change-with-big-data/","Tech2Impact","Tackling climate change with big data"," Tackling climate change with big data “I think we are just at the beginning of a massive revolution” Lubomila Jordanova Plan A Born in Bulgaria Living in Germany Focus: Climate Action Tech: Big Data Lubomila is the founder of Plan A, an impact tech startup that uses big data to tackle climate change. Doing this wasn’t always her plan at all. Lubomila has always been working in finance, first in investment banking, then in VC, and afterwards in a FinTech start-up in London. But something happened that changed her focus and career path a bit. How did you get involved with sustainability, climate change, and Plan A? A few years back, I went on a trip to Morocco, to explore the best places for surfing. This trip was definitely an eye-opening experience. I expected to see beautiful places to surf, but everything was really polluted, mostly covered in plastic. For the first time my eyes were open to the negative impact we, humans, had on our planet. After this experience I got back to London and started to dig deeper into the topic of pollution and climate change, spending all my free time for the next 6 months educating myself on climate change and the correlation it had to pollution through online courses, books, and scientific papers. The knowledge I accumulated showed me that the situation worldwide was actually much worse than what was communicated across channels. My next step was to conduct a vast survey with 300 people and 100 companies to understand the behaviors and opinions about climate change. This was the final straw. After this I was beyond convinced that addressing climate change needed a different approach. I quit my job and founded Plan A. How did all of this reflect on your personal life? I changed a lot in my daily life. Firstly, I have stopped taking any kind of transportation – I take my bike everywhere. Moreover, I don’t eat meat for 5 years now and I don’t eat processed products that are processed. Last but not least, I haven’t bought new clothes in the last 4 years. Ever since I started working on Plan A, I have so much respect for what nature gives us and her intelligence. This has helped me live a very minimalistic life – I don’t really have materialistic needs anymore. Somehow during this whole journey of consumerism, we ended up developing unnecessary needs for owning items. I can comfortably say I am beyond this. It’s quite shocking when you see the statistics on how many items an average person buys per year. So, what is Plan A? Plan A has developed the first Carbon Reduction Software which helps businesses calculate, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint monthly, while automatically building each month a tailored sustainability action plan and offsetting schemes, according to the footprint of the company. The technology behind the software uses insights from the Plan A algorithm which analyses over 300,000 data points to predict and prioritize the most critical environmental issues and the way industries and companies impact these environmental changes. For us, data has been very important since day one, as our fundamental basis is to respect the facts. I have made sure that we follow scientific principles and all the work that we do follows what the climate data science field has taught us. What was your best moment as a founder until now? There are so many! The first team member, our first event, our first “thank you” email, our first corporate client. In the last 6 months, the most exciting was the response to our software release. After we released the product, we had a waiting list of 300 companies within a few weeks. This was the proof that people and the companies where they worked were waking up to the urgency of climate change. What more would a Greentech startup dedicated to the reduction of emissions want? Do you think that being an impact founder is more challenging? I generally think that being an impact founder and any other entrepreneur involves the same activities and entrepreneurial challenges. You need to build a solid structure, a good team, set some tests to understand what your customers want, and develop an amazing offering people love. As long as there is a business model that allows the company to sustain itself, and to grow on a long-term basis, then the challenge for an impact and another tech startup is the same. One of the unique features of any impact startup is the dedication to the purpose of the company. Finding a topic that is bigger than you, bigger than a software, bigger than a life, makes you significantly more driven and also long-term dedicated. I feel incredibly honoured to be working on fighting climate change and would hope that one day every single business on this planet has the capacity to choose their own cause. Mine is climate change. I think it is important to start talking more about that because when you are building something for impact, people often think you are building an NGO or it’s something that won’t scale. It’s still not properly perceived as a proper business and this is visible in investment patterns and in opportunities of acceleration for companies – this image of impact business unfortunately still needs to be changed in people’s’ mindsets. Do you have any advice for (future) founders? Be curiousI’m not sure how I would’ve built Plan A without the constant need of feeding my brain with new content, knowledge, and facts. Be impatientNormally this is not considered to be a positive skill, but in my case it helped me to have a sense of urgency. Anyone fighting climate change or any other big issues should work with a sense of urgency. Be positivePositivity has this creative power to engage people, get them excited and active. If you need help or want your startup to succeed, put a smile on your face, and work on a daily basis with positivity. It moves mountains. Be balancedMaking sure that your head is clear is very important. I personally achieve this through yoga and meditation. It’s something that sets my day off in a way that I have a mind that can manage many tasks at the same time and a body that supports the intense work schedule. Be with a good teamI think if I would have been doing this by myself, I probably wouldn’t be as motivated. It would feel like fighting a battle on my own – and it’s a big battle, which you need good people for. What’s next? At the moment, companies are in a big existential crisis, as with the urgency of climate change and embedding new sustainable business flows, the companies need to reshuffle completely on how they are used to make business. We definitely see shifts and baby steps being made, but there is still a lot that needs to happen, as we are just at the beginning of a massive revolution I would say. Our mission in this revolution is to help companies to reduce their emissions, as our number one goal has always been climate action. We want to generate the biggest impact through helping thousands of companies learn how to embed sustainability into their existence Big agenda ahead, but we are beyond driven to see it through.

"https://tech2impact.com/technology-design-prevent-biases-from-determining-business-decisions/","Tech2Impact","Technology Design: How to prevent biases from determining your business decisions"," Technology Design: How to prevent biases from determining your business decisions Babett Kürschner After discussing the implications of socio-cultural understanding and business ethics, we’re going into the details of the Responsible Technology Assessment’s third key pillar this week: technology design. We’re delving into how mental shortcuts can influence your decision making and technology design in particular. Read on if you want to find out why this is especially relevant for tech startups, hear about concrete examples of business’ unintentional design flaws and learn what things you need to consider when coming up with your product or design! What is technology design? Coming up with a technological solution to your customers’ problems is a process. From identifying the problem to determining the best way to move forward, from creating the MVP to finally launching it after a lot of trial and error – there are many decisions you and your team have to make along the way. While it is obvious that technology design depends on the practical skills of the individual(s) who are developing it, the fact that individual beliefs, attitudes and behaviours have an equally great impact on the final outcome is often overlooked. Does this mean technology design is inherently biased? The short answer: yes. The long answer: most likely not on purpose, but still yes. Our individual experiences shape each of us into the person we are today, which distinctly influence every decision we make. This means that two individuals who are given the same set of information and confronted with the same choices can make profoundly different decisions based on their past experiences. This is due to the fact that our brain stores acquired knowledge as mental shortcuts, so called “building blocks”. This enables us to make decisions relatively quickly instead of having to rely on our brain’s processing power to ponder on every single action too long. This can be useful in everyday situations, like shopping for groceries for example. Instead of being paralysed by the sheer amount of choice we can buy a roll of paper towels with relative ease. But these shortcuts are often unconsciously used when making more important decisions too, which means we’re prone to fall back on consolidated stereotypes and biases that might not hold up under closer examination. Why is it important for tech startups? If you want to create the best version of your product or service, you need to make conscious, deliberate decisions during the technology design process. This is easier said than done when you’re dealing with unconscious beliefs and attitudes that you might not even be aware of. Nipping bias in the bud before it profoundly affects your technology is important if you want to come up with a final result that doesn’t accidentally turn off its intended target audience. What aspects of my technology do I need to give special attention to? There are different aspects of both hardware and software that run the risk of including unwanted partisan beliefs. Here are four elements that tech2impact and The Institute of Technological Ethics consider particularly significant for tech startup founders: Data collection Big data is an important and lucrative aspect of a technology business. Decisions about the type of data to collect (and how much to collect in the first place) have far-reaching consequences for your product or service. Algorithmic bias & transparency One of the inherent problems with technology is the manifestation of bias in algorithms, both within the selections of datasets to consider and the way decision-making processes are programmed. UI/UX design Features such as buttons, icons, colour schemes and imagery will affect how users engage with your product. Tech founders need to make sure these design choices are made with the best interests of their customers. Privacy concerns As a lot of the data that is collected digitally includes personal information – and in some cases highly sensitive and intimate material – protecting people’s personal data and information is crucial to run a responsible startup. What are examples of biased technology design? We introduced four businesses whose technology design included inherent flaws in our article on Good Technology Gone Bad, but there are countless other examples. Here’s a short excerpt: Face-recognition software of webcams not being able to track dark-skinned faces Chatbots created to emulate human conversation adopting and perpetuating racist and anti-feminist rhetoric“Beautifying” social media filters mimicking caucasian, western beauty standards and automatically making users’ skin colour a few shades lighterSpeech recognition software making twice as many errors when transcribing the voices of BIPOC than white Americans Really, we could go on and on. How can I make sure I’m making the best decisions for my startup? 1. Become aware of your own personal biases The very first step towards change is knowledge. Reflecting on your own background, privilege and bias is crucial to prevent them from leaking into your technology design. Taking the Responsible Technology Assessment is an excellent way to start. 2. Know your customers and stakeholders The first rule of technology design fight club is to know your stakeholders inside and out. For more detailed information on how socio-cultural understanding can help your startup grow, have a look at our article on representation and diversity. 3. Consider your sphere of operation Base your technology design decisions on information about the characteristics of your ecosystem instead of your own intuitions or assumptions. If we look at our previous example of the racist chatbot, its developers would have had to take a look and assess the data they were providing it in the first place. 4. Create diverse teams One reason for biases in technology design is the missing diversity within a team. Check your recruiting processes and make diversity in your company a priority. It will not only have advantages for your algorithms but will also improve your overall work culture. 5. Evaluate the outcome of your product or service After you design your product or service don’t rest on your laurels – make sure to test your output and outcome to ensure both are as unbiased as possible. Integrate continuous reviews to spot any potential accidental adverse effects as soon as possible.

"https://tech2impact.com/the-great-shift-technology-and-democracy-in-the-21st-century/","Tech2Impact","The great shift – technology and democracy in the 21st century"," The great shift – technology and democracy in the 21st century Babett Kürschner “It would be an understatement to say that politics have transformed in the past two decades. ”Sophie Spiegelberger, Chair of Democrats Abroad Austria’s Communications Committee Modern democracy is built on the idea that citizens have the power to select and vote for those who represent their interest the best. Digital technology has transformed the workings of democracy in profound ways and plays a central role in how people engage politically. It affects the power balance between individual citizens and the main socio-political institutions, political parties in particular. For our second last #ResponsibleTechInsights we had a chat with Sophie Spiegelberger, the Chair of Democrats Abroad Austria’s Communications Committee. We spoke about the challenges digitalisation has brought to political organisations and discussed the opportunities and risks of technological platforms across the political spectrum. You’re leading the Communications Committee at Democrats Abroad, can you tell us more about what that means? Democrats Abroad is the official arm of the Democratic Party representing Americans who live outside the US. Our mission is to provide American citizens living in Austria a voice in the U.S. government and to elect Democrats by mobilizing the overseas vote. As an organisation, our one and only goal is to encourage people to vote. The Communications Committee is a centerpiece of Democrats Abroad Austria’s internal mechanics. We liaise with different members and representatives to create campaigns, assist in marketing and contribute to membership growth. And in what areas are your main activities happening? Our job revolves around two pillars: press & media relations, and social media. When it comes to the press, organisations such as Democrats Abroad are called upon by local media to represent the Democratic Party in various debates, panels and interviews, especially during an election year. The challenge lies in walking the line of explaining often complex domestic U.S. policy issues to a foreign audience while also staying on message. Social media on the other hand, and I can’t stress this enough, is the flagship of every organisation in 2020. Your standing is often judged by your social media presence – the quality of your content and the tone you strike. Fast forward to 2020, where politicians are their own one-man media outlet. How has political communication changed throughout modern technology? It would be an understatement to say that politics have transformed in the past two decades. The 2008 election cycle was the first in which the internet began to muscle its way into the electoral process and I don’t have to tell you that it doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere anytime soon. Social media has become increasingly important. It was first hailed as a novel opportunity for candidates to connect and communicate with supporters directly, without the “hassle” of having to go through traditional media channels. Now fast forward to 2020, where politicians are their own one-man media outlet. Donald Trump has 88,7 million followers on Twitter while The New York Times has about half of that. Bypassing and discrediting journalists has become the name of the game, punching below the belt has become standard. Digital communication has become a battle post for political organisations. You deal with disinformation and internet trolls while you’re also trying to create content that goes viral. All of this is doing nothing to nurture a healthier democracy. Well, that definitely sounds like a lot. Any opportunities you see in using technology then? Statistics show that if only people under 35 voted, merely 35% would have cast their ballot for Trump. This means the direction is shifting towards a more progressive agenda. And there is incredible potential for technology to engage the younger generation a lot more. The Democratic National Committee for example has built a polished online and social media presence. They transitioned well into digital grassroots organising, utilising platforms like Slack to create online volunteer communities. The digitalisation of fundraising has also proven to be an immensely powerful tool, especially during the pandemic-stricken 2020 election. In my opinion, the most valuable tech solutions for campaigns aren’t social media platforms, but rather project management and fundraising software that make campaigning more efficient and accessible to a new set of people. As a smaller organisation, how do you approach the current digital landscape? Globally, Democrats Abroad has almost 200.000 members, our branch in Austria has only a fraction of that. With a small budget, using both organic and paid social media activities to spread the word is a must. Extremely targeted placements on social media for example are a good way to go. Of course this advantage for us can also be a disadvantage as a whole as it increases polarisation. On that note, I have a strict content policy at Democrats Abroad in place to avoid polarisation as best as we can. We pursue a strict no-Trump content strategy. I want our content to be constructive rather than in opposition to the incumbent, which is why we avoid references to his antics. The efforts that these companies made so far to combat this are not enough, they’ve gotten off scot-free. And what are the threats technology products and services pose? Bots, fake news and polarisation. Misinformation campaigns are intentionally designed to influence people’s views and beliefs in ways that benefit only one side, not the democratic process. There were first signs of social media platforms being misused in this sense in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But the efforts that these companies made so far to combat this are not enough, they’ve gotten off scot-free. Labelling Trump’s tweets with cautionary messages that indicate they contain, to put it mildly, questionable claims are largely symbolic. They haven’t proven to stop the virality of his tweets. When people’s opinions are influenced and inevitably distorted by information that is incorrect, inaccurate and not trustworthy, their political decisions and actions are effectively harmful to themselves. Fake News is the buzzword of 2016, 2020 and beyond; what’s your stance on this? Social media often gets blamed for the explosion of fake news. Few talk about traditional media’s role in polarising the electorate. Driven by a ratings-craze, America’s TV networks, on both sides, have shifted further and further apart. MSNBC is as much to blame as FOX News and many liberals don’t want to acknowledge that. Filter bubbles a product of network TV too. So as long as we demonise social media for creating alternate versions of reality, we are addressing only half of the problem. There’s a need for publicly-funded media that doesn’t rely on advertising in the U.S.. Especially local journalism has been experiencing a painful death. Until money and media are detached from one another I don’t see how we will be able to tackle this deep polarisation. This isn’t journalism, this is his personal opinion. Then how are you dealing with the spread of misinformation? The key to combating misinformation is not framing your content in opposition to something else. What I mean by that is the following: present the facts without referring to the fake news you are trying to debunk. Trump uses fake news very deftly. He tweets whatever’s on his mind, whether it’s true or not. These posts will be seen, liked and shared by millions of people. This isn’t journalism, this is his personal opinion. What’s interesting, however, is that his claims then get picked up and validated by traditional news networks that should (at least in theory) have some sort of journalistic integrity. Which is exactly what happened when Trump refused to concede despite no evidence of voter fraud in this year’s election. Exactly. This was to be expected though. He announced that he might not accept the results if he lost four years ago too. In 2020 his message remained surprisingly consistent. Perhaps this was a good thing. Democrats were absolutely prepared for the possibility of him contesting the results and refusing to cooperate. This means that the Biden campaign was able to meticulously plan out their post-election messaging and lawyer up to fight him in court. This is probably the first time I’m saying this but #ThanksTrump. Do you have any closing thoughts you would like to share with our readers? All in all I’m very optimistic when it comes to democracy and technology. We’re far from using all of the digital opportunities that are out there. Humans are infinitely innovative and I can’t wait to see what developments are just around the corner.

We looked at established ways to participate in the decision making process and came to the realisation that there was no easy and practical way for citizens to provide input. We wanted to explore how we could make our voices heard, as we really wanted to contribute ideas on how to improve things in our city. How did your first project look like? When we started four years ago, participatory democracy was still very new. Some cities might have experimented with it but it was definitely not the standard. If you take a look at the situation today, participatory democracy has become complimentary to representative democracy. This is obviously good news for us. Our very first project was in April 2016 in Hasselt, Belgium. It was launched when the city was planning to set up a new park. Typically only 20-30 people showed up to their town hall meetings. We ended up getting over 600 people involved, so I’d definitely say it was quite a success. Back then we were using a prototype with more basic functions. But as we expanded our team and our co-founder and CTO Koen Gremmelprez joined, we scaled up the technology to a degree where over 150 cities from many different countries are using our platform today to keep their citizens engaged. How does it work exactly? As citizens, there are two ways to participate. The most common way is through the projects a city proposes. Within these projects we provide governments with a toolbox that includes a variety of methods they can use according to their needs. There are different ways to include citizens – think participatory budgeting, idea collection or surveys. But citizens can also make their voice heard through an important instrument that we call “citizen proposals”. They can launch their own proposal and once it gets the required amount of support from other verified citizens it gets passed on to the city council for consideration. This is a way to have a very direct impact and determine the political agenda from the bottom-up. When it comes to governments, we provide them with a back office where they can design their individual participatory process, explore the data to get detailed insights and gain a better understanding of their citizens’ needs. Our customers are mostly local governments. They buy an annual subscription for our platform and the software. But CitizenLab is obviously not only a tool or a technological platform, we also offer consulting services to help governments get the most out of it. A tool in itself is just a tool but it’s also crucial to know how to utilise it correctly. What was your biggest challenge at CitizenLab so far? It’s a challenge to really create change and institutionalise citizen participation. It’s easy to convince governments to do a project to engage their citizens but a paradigm shift towards opening up dialogue is harder. There needs to be a cultural change in the way administrations work, as citizens are asking for more transparency, more responsiveness from policy makers and more means to participate. Initially we thought that we just needed to provide a platform but we now understand that we need to look at it more holistically. Cities need guidance on how to actually get the most out of the platform and help to adopt and adapt to these new processes. Do you have any kind of criteria for cities that want to use your platform? We work with cities of all sizes. Generally we’d say cities should have at least 10,000 inhabitants in order to get a lot of value from the platform. If your smaller community is spread out it could definitely still be useful. However we realised that with large cities it’s easier to achieve change and see a high adoption of the platform. As of now we’re focusing on local governments but we are looking to work with regional and national governments too in the near future. Of course this will be a very different dynamic. Local governments are very action focused while it’s more about bigger policies and citizen dialogue on a regional or national level. We actually developed something that could be very useful for higher level governments as a response to the pandemic. A new online workshop-module for our toolbox enables online public meetings, with moderators asking questions, citizens giving their input and collaborating together in breakout groups. What was your best moment as a founder so far? First I would say that getting people on board that are truly motivated by the purpose of your company is just fantastic. When people believe in your mission it enables you to build a culture where your employees have more responsibility and autonomy because they are very self-driven. Our people believe that the work they do is important and recognise the contribution they make to society. This is by far what gives me the most energy and satisfaction on a daily basis. Second, I would say enabling governments to give people a say gives me a lot of gratification. Every single project on the platform is a meaningful opportunity for citizens to engage. I think there are a lot of stereotypes about the public sector. Five years ago this was something investors wouldn’t even look at. But today we are in a totally different era and people understand that policies that affect thousands of people are a great way to create impact and actually improve quality of life for so many. It’s remarkable to see how much more interest there is these days for government technology. Where do you see CitizenLab five years from now? I see us as a global company. We already worked with partners who have a local network and expertise in different countries in order to enter into new markets, so expanding globally with local experts is definitely a plan for the future. On the other hand we also want to make sure that we increase the uptake among citizens. We want to create lasting impact and enable citizens to meaningfully engage on the platform. We want to lower the barrier and get even more citizens to engage with their government. Do you have any advice for upcoming or already active impact tech founders? Yes, my advice is actually pretty straightforward. From day one, hire people who are devoted to your mission. Your mission is your biggest draw, it’s what sets social enterprises apart from other businesses when it comes to attracting talent. Be authentic about your vision and create a brand that is trustworthy. In the end, building a successful business is mainly about finding a very talented group of people who work towards the same goal. Managing to bring across your mission is the best way for social changemakers to really grow their impact in the long run. My second advice is that there is a great importance in sharing your expertise openly and collaboratively. For us this has been a focus from day one: sharing our knowledge, connecting with thought-leaders in our field and collectively shaping the future of digital democracy. Don’t be afraid and don’t keep your ideas to yourself – share what you know with others! It’s a really great way to build a reputation in your domain and create leverage.

"https://tech2impact.com/the-robotic-glove-that-can-change-peoples-lives/","Tech2Impact","The robotic glove that can change people’s lives"," The robotic glove that can change people’s lives “Within 10 seconds, a paralyzed man could eat and drink all by himself.” Sofie Woge Tendo Born in Sweden Living in Sweden Focus: Health Tech: Robotics During her studies, Sofie was given the opportunity to attend a research course at NASA in Houston. There she had the task to create something, which would make life easier when we are going to Mars. She developed a device, which looks like a glove for the hands, to give astronauts resistance in everything they do. Moreover, it can give them artificial support when needed. This should prevent astronauts from losing muscle activity and fine motor skills during their time in space. After finishing it, she had the idea to use it also for people on earth. Getting to know diverse insights from patient organizations and people with disabilities she brought the technology together and started Tendo. What is Tendo all about? At Tendo, we’re developing robotic assistive devices for people who are disabled or have limited abilities. We developed a robotic glove that assists people who don’t have hand function. It’s a so-called exoskeleton, which you wear almost like a glove. It has a control unit that’s placed on the arm and it helps you to move your fingers and to get the strength you need. It has a biometric sensor that can detect what you want to do. So, when the sensor detects that you’re trying to grip and your hand doesn’t respond to it itself, it picks up the signals and sends the signal to the control unit. And from the control unit on the arm, we have wires that go to the glove. There are wires on the inside and outside of the glove and if you pull them the hand opens or closes. You can imagine it like a puppeteer, pulling strings, making your fingers move. For whom are you developing the product? In the first part of the company journey, we focused on people with rheumatic diseases and strokes. But then we actually met a man who is paralyzed. He tried the product and within 10 seconds, he could eat and drink by himself. We realized that it was such a big difference for him to be able to do these kinds of activities by himself. It was a clearer problem and value compared to other target groups. Therefore we decided to start there and flipped the target group. Now we are mainly addressing people who are paralyzed due to a high spinal cord injury. Those people are paralyzed in most parts of their bodies, except for that one or two arms, but without hand function. Nevertheless, our long-term goal is to include more target groups. Our product has also big potential for people who suffered a stroke. It’s a big target group and there is a huge need as well. If you had a stroke, you can have just as many problems opening the hand as you have to close it. That’s a big benefit with our technology compared to many others on the market, as it both opens and closes the hand. Where do you see Tendo in five years? In five years, we definitely would like to have grown as a company, as a team, and in (market) size. Our plan is to keep the Scandinavian market to ourselves but to license the technology globally. Within five years, we want to have licensees at least in the US. Moreover, we already received interest from users, clinics, and potential partners from all over the world. The product should start getting out there. Besides that, I definitely see us broadening our product portfolio and launching new products. Until now, what was your best moment as a founder? I think the best moment was the first user workshop, where we had this user who was able to drink and eat for the first time in 20 years. He was the first user we properly introduced the technology to and he was so happy. He lifted up his glass, proudly, to cheer with us many times! This was such a great day. We got proof that all the hard work was worth it and we can make a difference. That was 1.5 years ago and I still smile when I think about it. What would you say was your biggest challenge? I think everything has been quite challenging in a way. In the beginning, the most difficult thing was to figure out what it means to be an entrepreneur. I think the biggest challenge throughout time has been that medical devices bring a lot of rules and regulations. That’s of course there for a reason, but sometimes as a startup, you get a bit frustrated. So, developing a medical device is extremely expensive and time-consuming due to all the regulations that exist. Do you think that people look at you differently because you’re a female founder? It’s a difficult question, as I only know my perspective. I think it’s sometimes good, sometimes bad to be a female founder. Statistically, I have a disadvantage of finding investments and people believing that I can do it. On the other hand, the benefit is that people recognize or remember the company more easily because I’m basically always the only woman in the room. I think as a female CEO, I still stand out and that can also be beneficial. But there have been inappropriate situations too. There were investors that say that they have fewer beliefs in female founders and I should never go to a meeting without a man because alone, as a woman, I am less credible. I have no idea if that’s true though. It’s definitely a difficult question to answer. Do you have any advice for other (impact tech) founders? Be out there and talk about it as much as you possibly can. I think many people aren’t talking (enough) about their idea, as they’re scared that people will steal it. But you don’t need to be afraid of that because you just say what you’re doing not how you’re doing it. Honestly, a big part of us being quite successful in the beginning was because we were always out there talking about it. I even called up newspapers saying “I have a super cool story you want to write about it?” instead of waiting for them to contact me. And they did, we got a good attraction and then more things followed. Get different perspectives and always aim for easy-understandable storytelling. If you love your technology/work, it’s easy to get stuck on it. So you need to start looking at it from all the perspectives that are out there – from an investor, your customers, etc. Put yourself in their shoes, because if you can’t tell the story in a way that they like it, it’s not going to be successful. Then go out and talk to them and if you don’t get a positive response, ask yourself why. Do you tell the story in a wrong way or did you just meet the wrong people? Generally, I think it’s common that people try to impress by saying difficult words, but you don’t impress anyone, you just exclude them from the conversation. Build a strong team. I’m always the person outside talking, but I have a super-strong team behind me that works really hard to get the technology in place, and it would not be possible to do it without them. We’ve been really lucky to have great people from the beginning with diverse perspectives and backgrounds. It can be very challenging as well, as it can take a bit of time for us to agree on something but when we do it’s a great outcome.

"https://tech2impact.com/using-tech-to-challenge-gender-inequality-an-sdg-5-progress-analysis/","Tech2Impact","Using tech to challenge gender inequality? An SDG 5 progress analysis"," Using tech to challenge gender inequality? An SDG 5 progress analysis Sarah Klimt tech2impact The 8th of March represents International Women’s Day – a global day to celebrate women’s achievements and raise awareness of women’s equality and gender parity as exemplified by this year’s #ChooseToChallenge theme. In this sense, we want to take a closer look at Sustainable Development Goal number 5 (SDG 5), namely gender equality and women and girls’ empowerment and have a look at the current status quo in our society. The basics The United Nations has defined gender equality by stating women and men possess equal rights, equal access to any opportunities, and the right to assume any responsibilities irrespective of whether they are born female or male. SDG 5 covers a diverse range of targets that aim to eliminate the following gender inequalities: Discrimination, violence, and exploitation against all women and girls everywhereHarmful practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage… and drives constructive work across the following areas: Acknowledge and value unpaid care and domestic work Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rightReforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, including access to ownership, inheritance, financial services, and natural resourcesPromote the use of technology, especially information and communications technology to empower womenReinforce policies and legislation for the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levelsThe scope of SDG 5 is rightly large and ambitious, which makes us wonder about the current state of gender equality today. So, let us take a look at some of the stats from the previous years. The details Progress continues to lag due to existing economic and social barriers for women and girls. Although there are improvements in problematic areas such as child marriage, female genital mutilation, and the underrepresentation of women in the political realm, gender inequalities continue to persist. Impact of COVID 19 With the Covid-19 pandemic, the consensus is that gender inequalities are bound to amplify, and areas showing improvements so far are likely to regress. Considering that before the pandemic, women were already carrying the main burden of unpaid work than men, this tendency is set to grow even more now. For instance, a poll covering 17 countries on unpaid work reveals that women and girls have taken over a large share of responsibility regarding childcare, family, and household duties due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The strong emphasis on unpaid work has implications on a woman’s access to time, income, career opportunities, and their mental well-being. Figure 1: Statistics on child marriage and unpaid work prior to the pandemic. (Source: The Sustainable Development Goals 2020 Report)The pandemic could hamper the efforts that already went into addressing child marriage and female genital mutilation. Simultaneously, the lockdowns have subjugated increased violence on women, with data showing an increase in domestic violence reporting calls. Employment equality Regarding employment, in both emerging and mature economies, the pattern of work is gender-specific (Figure 2). Female workers are 19 percent more likely to be at risk than male workers. A well-known fact by now is that women, in general, are disproportionately represented in sectors adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2: Examples of female and male work clusters, showing that employment is gender-specific. (Source: McKinsey)The gender pay gap is currently at 23 percent globally, and without any targeted action, it will take 68 years to achieve equal pay. The World Economic Forum believes that it will take 217 years to reach gender parity if gender inequality continues the way it is currently seen in the workforce and politics. Urgent action is needed to drive gender equality, knowing that $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 by promoting women’s equality. It is very accurate to highlight this statement on gender inequality that it is not just a “moral and social issue but also a critical economic challenge”. The future is in responsible tech One of the many goals of gender equality lies in using technology to empower women. It could either be by encouraging women to choose STEM subjects and improve their representation in this sector or use tech solutions to solve wicked problems. A more diverse team is most likely to be more creative, innovative and deliver higher profitable outcomes. Representation of women and girls in leadership positions is one way of addressing prevailing gender inequalities, considering that such roles are underrepresented by women – “for every 100 men in leadership positions, there are just 37 women”. You may ask yourself why is this important? The term gender equality acknowledges that the “needs, interests, roles and experiences of women and men” vary and require further understanding to address gender inequality at its core. A strategy used to analyse such differences is known as gender mainstreaming, which aims to integrate both women’s and men’s perspectives regarding decision-making and planning of any project or policy implementation. The way forward Inherently, such a process challenges prevailing societal structures by recognising that both women’s and men’s realities are different, which in turn helps to tackle gender inequalities over a long-term basis. In this regard, gender mainstreaming is not about achieving gender balance but by analysing the context of both sexes via a gender analysis, ensuring that their voices are heard, and creating an equal playing field. Figure 3: A framework for gender mainstreaming (Source: European Institute for Gender Equality)Now, if women are underrepresented in sectors such as tech, then it is highly likely that not enough thought will be given towards gendered considerations. For example, artificial intelligence requires data, which contains bias as the data that is inputted in the first place is not neutral but influenced by the person inputting the data and this is not free from gender, race, and culture biases. Considering that the majority of the population working in tech are male, will most likely have implications on gender equality. The tech2impact members that #ChooseToChallenge Amongst tech2impact’s ecosystem, we have startups that address the SDG goal of gender equality, and who have chosen to challenge issues related to gender bias and gender inequalities. ETIQ AI ETIQ AI for example has an intentional approach to artificial intelligence by creating software that determines algorithmic biases. This, in turn, is likely to prevent wrongful gender stereotypes and break barriers for women when it comes to hiring decisions, loan approvals, medical diagnosis, etc. Develop Diverse Similarly, the startup Develop Diverse offers a software solution that addresses stereotypical content for gender, age, ethnicity, and helps provide non-stereotypical alternatives. And in turn, HR and communication managers make recruitment processes more inclusive, encouraging a diverse set of applicants to apply. It does show that language can convey stereotypes and discourage around 50 percent of prospective applicants from entering the talent pool when not communicated appropriately. Metta Space When it comes to sexual harassment Metta Space’s offers a B2B integrated platform, a first of its kind to help companies put an end to sexual harassment and allow them to deal with such cases effectively. Also, their reporting app for employees is set to release very soon too! Salvatio Push A further example of tech enabling women’s protection is Salvatio Push, a wearable gadget used to prevent violence against women. The device comes with a push-button, which allows the user to reveal their location to their community whilst facing a dangerous situation. Respondents who are part of the community can notify the authorities in a timely manner to take rapid action. Essentially, it is a prime example of using technology to make spaces more inclusive and safe for women. Bridge Gap Renewables Inc. Last but definitely not least is the startup Bridge Gap Renewables Inc. They aim to enable electrification for rural communities and provide an alternative to diesel generators. The digital gap between rural and urban areas is significant and problematic. What urban communities might take for granted such as quick internet and reliable power is not a reality for rural areas. The latter are more likely to miss out on education and business related opportunities. Both are vital factors to emancipate women and girls, which Bridge Gap Renewables contributes to achieving. Concluding remarks Of course, tech alone cannot solely fix gender problems without thoughtful considerations given to different gendered contexts. It is not surprising that the Good Tech Lab warns us that technological solutions should focus on understanding systems and data. The authors advocate for systems thinking – understanding the context of problems and their interrelationships as illustrated in the following quote: “Think in systems—and data. Wicked problems resist any reductionist solution. Addressing them requires to understand system dependencies, differentiate effects from root causes, prioritize the best leverage points on which to intervene, and anticipate unintended consequences.” Good Tech Lab To explore more engaging examples of tech ventures that enable the Sustainable Development Goals, be sure to use tech2impact’s Impact Tech Radar.

"https://theventury.com/blog/5-biggest-crowdfunding-mistakes/","TheVentury","5 Biggest Crowdfunding mistakes (creators can avoid)","After planning and launching a couple of crowdfunding campaigns like the latest one for Pocket Sky you start to see common misconceptions connected to crowdfunding.If you’re planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign soon, make sure you’re avoiding these five major mistakes <U+0001F9E8>Crowdfunding Mistake #1: Only relying on the platform’s communityI have a great product, I set up a beautiful campaign page, even made a nice video, and then I launched …. but nothing happened! <U+0001F937> via GIPHYA lot of creators purely rely on the community of a crowdfunding platform. Let’s take for example Kickstarter with its more than 17 Mio supporters… yes 17 Mio! That sounds massive, doesn’t it? Nevertheless only 20% of technology projects are successfully funded, while raising on average less than $10,000.With great numbers comes great competition! It’s not only you who is launching but on average there are about 400 other projects online in the tech-space alone. So how can you stand out?To benefit from the platform’s community, you first have to build up your own community – before launching! So once you launch you already have your first supporters queued up. This first push is very important! It helps you to get a decent ranking on the platform, which gives you visibility to the community! Now you can start benefiting from the platform’s community.Crowdfunding Mistake #2: Not telling people that you’re launching via GIPHYUnfortunately, a lot of creators literally forget about the most obvious thing: to make sure everyone knows that their campaign has started and that they need their support now.Be prepared! Make a list of all the people (that includes family and friends) that showed interest. I recommend adding the likelihood of them supporting, so at the end you have a reliable number of first supporters. Once you launch make sure every single one of them knows that you’re live!Don’t forget to post it on your social media channels or other relevant channels, and to send out a newsletter in case you were collecting email addresses upfront.Crowdfunding Mistake #3: Not getting feedback before you launch via GIPHYOn the majority of platforms, you get a preview link of your campaign once you start setting it up. Use this link to gather feedback before you launch. Make sure you send it to people who are not yet aware of your product and ask them for feedback: Is it clear what you are doing? Is any information missing? What needs improvement? Is the video grabbing attention?I can guarantee you, there will be valuable feedback, which will help you make your campaign ever better.Crowdfunding Mistake #4: Not submitting your campaign early enoughCrowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter need to approve your project before you launch. Make sure to submit your project at least one week before your planned and communicated launch. Normally they approve or get back to you within 2-3 days. In case you need to adjust something, you have some buffer days.Crowdfunding Mistake #5: Ignoring seasons via GIPHYLaunching a solar BBQ <U+0001F356> <U+2744><U+FE0F> in winter or Skis in summer <U+0001F3BF><U+0001F334>- does that sound like a good idea? Starting in the wrong season can kill your campaign. Two main reasons: First of all, most supporters don’t care about BBQ in winter or Skis in summer. Secondly the media doesn’t care about it either. Hence it will be really difficult for you to get press coverage. Keep in mind your products “main season” if there is one and launch in that time frame.Keep these 5 mistakes in mind, and never forget: preparation is key to success!Happy launching!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ELEVATE_Breakfast_113-scaled-377x250.jpg","March 6, 2020","en",0.992937386035919,0.348751604557037,0.38982617855072,0.0927577689290047,0.168664500117302

Bots have evolved to a point where they can provide a new way for customers to interact with brands – in a meaningful and useful way. Consumers crave real-time, efficient, on-demand conversations without hassle. An experience chatbots are already able to perfectly provide today.You have probably already come across chatbots (If not, you might want to check out our blog). Chatbots provide a conversational interface aimed at solving customers’ problems. In simple industries – sure. But is this also possible in more complex cases? Enter insurance chatbots.Making insurances sexy with conversational interfacesThink about the insurance industry, where there is a lot of in-depth communication needed between a business and a client. These insurance processes require time, effort and the filling of a ridiculous amounts of documents – You know the struggle and you probably hate it as much as we do!The Road from paperwork to AIWould you believe us if we tell you there is a better way to do it? By working with an insurance chatbots. To give you a better understanding of the potential of conversational interfaces in this case, let us present to you 5 things we love about insurance bots:Make a claim – 24/7 with insurance chatbotsRecord a claim from your phone and check its status at any time and any place. No calls. No repetitive hold music. No redirection to a call centre halfway around the world. The bot is there for you, 24/7 – No restrictions.Get feedback right awayThe bot will answer your simplest questions so you get feedback not 3-5 business days later, but right away. It works efficiently, quickly and is convenient. Your communication with the bot can happen on the channels of your choice, be it a messenger, mail, voice device or many others.Explain matters only onceYou know how insurance hotlines will redirect you multiple times, forcing you to explain your issue over and over again? Not with chatbots. Conversations are traceable and take protocol so humans can take over at any time.Customer service bots can create incidents and tracks issues – or can alternatively assign them to real employees should the task get too complex.Attach your documentation right awayNo need to fill out documents about how the accident happened and send photos from all angles per mail. Do all of that via bot. With today’s image recognition opportunities, the pictures can be analyzed directly by the bot and processed to further understand what the customer needs.Get information you did not even know you wanted The thing about self-learning bots is: They gets smarter with every question they are being asked! While the Bot can understand your current needs it may even suggest policies you might be interested in at the time – The bot acts as a sales person and adds value to the customer experience.Ready for the insurance revolution?We are happy to help you with an enterprise ready framework for the bots you have been dreaming of.

First task: Evaluating, rethinking and upgrading their business model and validating it– a painful but necessary process.Personal Highlight: Introducing the international teams to Schweinebraten & Glühwein – a very typical Austrian dish & drink – at a Christmas market. “When we joined ELEVATE, we had already launched our product, so we were very interested to continue to develop product and go after the customers. But ELEVATE made us take a step back and think more critically about our overall product and key hypotheses. As a result of that we interviewed 2 dozen real estate agents, and we got some very interesting insights that resulted in our product roadmap changes.” – Jatinder Singh, BotplanFavorite Moment #2 – Facebook in the HouseHaving Susann Fischer from Facebook, Markus Brunner from the Facebook Messenger Platform Team, Prashant Pitti from nearGroup and of course our one and only Greg Leuch from Poncho – an all-time Vienna fan – all here in Vienna for a very special mentoring day with our startups was great. Having experienced chatbot startup founders mentoring our teams and sharing their learnings was a fantastic way of giving our startups new perspectives. Ending the day with our Grand Bots Meetup was just the cherry on top!Personal Highlight: This is – again – food-related: A huge ELEVATE dinner with our mentors, teams and the ELEVATE team.Favorite Moment #3 – US Team relocating to ViennaOur team from the US, Polaama relocated to Vienna for the last three months of the program. Having the teams here full-time means work is getting done really fast, the progress is bigger – it also means fun lunch breaks and impromptu German lessons. “Some of my ELEVATE highlights: Working with the ELEVATE team assigned to me, how it feels like a real team and how much we have been able to accomplish as a team” – Madhu Parasarathy, PolaamaFavorite Moment #4 – Progress, progress, progressOur teams and mentors are working incredibly hard to making their visions come to life and making their customers’ lives easier. We know that. But some of the best moments throughout the accelerator program were the ones when we realized how much the teams and their businesses have progressed. Be it after pitching and roasting sessions, progress updates or just in between through conversations with each other. We can’t wait to see what our startups’ future will bring!Personal highlight: All the pitching & roasting sessions, when we’re a bit tough on the teams but they show us just how much is in them!Extra Moment – Karaoke Night! Yes, this has to be mentioned, because it was just too much fun. Who doesn’t like a chill karaoke night after a hard day of work? That’s what we thought, so we got our whole team and the startups together – and we went all out. It was a blast! Who would’ve thought all these people in the accelerator aren’t only talented business people, but got so many other hidden talents? Definitely calls for a rerun! “The gals and guys from TheVentury were great mentors for us. We expected that in a way when we applied. But we didn´t expect they would kill us in Karaoke :)” – Michael Nigsch, ibindoThese were just a few highlights of the last 5 months, just a few words will never be enough to describe the whole journey . So this is just a ”tip of the iceberg” kind of thing – to tell our mentors and our teams how much we value them and how much fun it was. And to give you an idea how we do not just elevate businesses, but also the people behind it.If you are interested in what our teams were working on throughout the program, then request access to our Demo Day (May 23rd).ELEVATE Batch#3 – October 2018ELEVATE is coming back in October 2018 – Join the ELEVATE family! You’ll get hands-on coaching, as well as IT-development and growth marketing support.

"https://theventury.com/blog/accelerator-opens-for-corporate/","TheVentury","ELEVATE Accelerator now open for corporate teams","Since 2016, we have supported over 20 startups through their initial growth process with our accelerator program ELEVATE. And now, for the first time ever, we have opened ELEVATE to established companies. We are thrilled to have RBI on board for our batch 6 with their intrapreneurship team. “By opening the Elevate accelerator program to intrapreneurship teams, we will henceforth offer them an agile and inspiring environment to work side by side with young startups on forward-looking ideas and business models,”– Katharina Binder, Head of AcceleratorAt TheVentury we have been supporting both, startups as well as established companies. Through the years we have experienced the parallels between intrapreneurship teams and early-stage startup teams – the similar needs they have in their most intensive growth phase and the common struggles that they face. We realized that including intrapreneurs in an entrepreneurship program will open up a valuable space of learning together and also from each other. While intrapreneurship teams can learn about the entrepreneurial mindset and increase their dynamic capabilities, startups benefit from their organisational know-how and deep industry knowledge. This is why, starting with March this year, we decided to offer selected intrapreneurship teams from large companies the opportunity to immerse into the typical startup environment of ELEVATE.De-risking innovationOne crucial attribute that corporates are looking for in innovation programs is risk minimization. Innovation is risky at its core, often associated with uncertainty and driven by assumptions. We help to derive facts from the underlying assumptions of a business model thorough testing and validation. This way, we take risk out of the implementation of innovation projects and allow a solid foundation for such investments.With our 4-month-program, we have found a way to support the development of new technological solutions in a resource-efficient way – and all that in an inspiring start-up environment with the help of agile processes and external know-how.First to join: Raiffeisen Bank InternationalF.l.t.r.: Maximilan Unger, Nicole Stroj (RBI), Aleksandra Petkov-Georgieva (RBI) and Katharina BinderWe are happy to have RBI on board and to support them in their journey of becoming the most innovative financial services provider on the market. Since March, RBI’s intrapreneurship team has been working alongside three tech startups, attending bootcamp sessions and working on their prototype with the hands-on support of our experts. The goal is to complete the program with a tested and marketable MVP – a new financial solution in the agricultural sector. “We are pleased to further drive our innovation efforts together with our partner TheVentury. Innovation is an essential part of our strategy and will help RBI to continuously and sustainably improve and optimize the customer experience” – Nicole Stroj, Head of Organisational Innovation at RBIRead the full press release (german only) here.Batch #7 planned in September 2021The next batch of ELEVATE will start in September 2021, with the second round now open to three corporates and six startups.

"https://theventury.com/blog/addressing-bias-in-ai/","TheVentury","How to address bias in AI","In my previous post “Bias in AI“, I gave and explanation of how bias can arise in AI. I aimed to give an impression that bias – particularly prejudicial bias – can only be addressed through company-wide solutions. In this blog post I want to offer some suggestions on how companies can address prejudicial biases. Types of biases To direct the discussion, I organize the types of bias into a triangle that views sources of bias from the perspective of a company. At the base are ingrained, societal biases which can influence many areas of a business. Next are the business-related practices and finally those related to machine learning. The order suggests where the most effort is needed to address bias, so I’ll follow this order going forward. In this article, I will be covering the following:Societal biasBias in business practicesBias in the development processIdentifying bias through data analyticsTech solutions Mathematical definitionsBias mitigation ToolsThe TakeawaysSocietal bias A company should not dismiss extrinsic, societal bias. Business leaders may be tempted to say “We hire fewer female developers because there are fewer female developers on the market”.While this may be true, everyone knows that it should not be this way. Institutions as well as individuals should take a responsibility to make a positive impact on society. For example, a tech firm can support their female developers in community outreach to bring tech to school age girls. I have been impressed with the outreach that I see at TheVentury. We have female developers and project leaders who engage with school age girls to show that the tech field can be a place for them. We also engage with organizations like Female Factor & Female Founders to support women who are founders or have influential roles in their companies. Supporting outreach not only helps to reduce biases, but also generates exposure for the company. Bias in business practices Existing biases can easily enter business practices unless they are given active consideration. Hiring is an obvious example of this. Certain groups may not be well represented in the employee pool. Unless a company puts effort into reaching out to such groups, they will continue to be under represented. It is important to recognize that diversity brings value to the company. Many studies have shown that having a diverse team improves performance and results. In addition to hiring, businesses should think carefully on how societal biases relate to their products or services. Project goals should be critiqued for potential biases. Questions like “Who is excluded by this product?”, “Which groups will have difficulties to access this service?”, and “How can we ensure that our product reaches a diverse audience?” can help to address biases. I don’t aim to give a complete prescription here because it depends on the business model, but consideration should be given in this manner to reduce bias. Bias in the development process Biases can be introduced at the development stage as well. The most common causes are tight development schedules and hard deadlines. When developers are under pressure to deliver, they focus on the immediate outcomes and are unable to look at the broader picture.To address this, developers should be given sufficient time to consider broader implications of projects and how bias can enter. Starting with a diverse team will also help to identify potential biases. From the project management perspective, addressing bias should be thought of in the same way as testing. It requires more resources up-front, but insures a more reliable and extensible product in the end. Identifying bias through data analyticsSince bias enters AI principally through the data, understanding the data is a key component of identifying and mitigating bias. When projects are under pressure, there may not be sufficient time to explore and understand the data. It is easy to shove data into a model, measure the performance, and move on. The real work should be to understand the data, the model, and the entire process in order to identify any issues, such as bias. Therefore, time and resources need to be dedicated these important elements of data science. Tech solutionsWhen I started researching bias in AI, my aim was to understand and expand on the tech solutions. However it became clear to me that tech solutions are just a bandage over a deeper wound. Yes, tech solutions can help you bring a better product to market, but this alone cannot address the existing biases. To really solve bias means to address it at every level as I described above. Only then should you feel confident to apply a tech solution. Mathematical definitions Biases are measured through formulas that mathematically capture our concept of bias. For example you can calculate the fraction of male or female hires with respect to the field of applicants. If they are equal or nearly equal than there is no bias. There are many ways to mathematically define bias and I could dedicate an entire blog post to the definitions, but fortunately someone already has. If you are more interested in the mathematical definitions, check out this blog post, Each measurement of bias tells you something different about the model so we normally checks against multiple formulas. It is very possible that some formulas will show bias while others will not. The data scientists along with project managers must decide if further action should be taken based on the full set of results. It is important to note that the AI cannot discover our biases for us – it knows nothing about human values. We therefore can only measure bias with respect to attributes that we have identified. This is an important weakness in relying on a tech solution. Bias mitigationIf biases are identified, there are a few possible remedies. The most obvious solution is to not use the data source or discard the model, but this is often not realistic given the needs for data and the demands of customers. Furthermore, even if other data sources are available and other models can be developed, they may have the same, or different biases. There are essentially three places where we can attempt to mitigate bias. The most direct method is to modify the data source. Since the data contain all of the information and correlations modifying the data is the most direct method. In some cases, the data may not be modifiable, perhaps because it is provided by another source. In this instance, instead of modifying the data, the model itself can be modified. Indeed the model is just a large set of weights that approximate the data. By modifying those weights, the biases can be corrected. The last method is to modify the output of the model, in the case where one has no access to the data or the model creation. This method corrects the output to remove bias, but has the least flexibility. ToolsThere are a number of enterprise tools that are available to address bias. I would like to highlight an open-source framework developed by IBM called IBM fairness 360. This framework covers the full tech solution including bias measurement using many different metrics and algorithms that apply the three types of mitigation methods. You can find some demos on their website. The framework can be used through its API, allowing anybody with some tech experience to plug in their data, measure bias, and apply mitigation methods. I will emphasize that such a tool should not be used blindly. It can help in understanding your data and models. If you use a bias mitigation method then you still need to understand what modifications were made and ensure that the performance is maintained in all aspects.At TheVentury we have already explored using fairness 360, so if you would like to evaluate and mitigate bias in your data, let us know! We can help with not only the technical aspects, but also how to address bias in the broader ways that I discussed above.The TakeawaysBias is a deeply ingrained problem that does not have simple solutions. It results from historical norms, is reflected in human behavior, and is therefore baked into the data. Indeed, as our understanding of bias has improved over time, we recognize our own biases and correct our behavior. This is unfortunately a slow process, so we need some solutions to overcome biases in data. Importantly we should also work to speed up the process by addressing bias directly. Primarily this means that time and resources need to be dedicated to understanding and addressing biases. Data scientists should have time to understand the data and to develop models that are explainable. Development and project goals should be evaluated for possible bias.Hiring a diverse team is a good step towards confronting these biases. Even overall business goals should be evaluated in the context of bias. Finally, we should all take a responsibility to address bias. Companies can contribute in one way by supporting their employees in outreach programs. This makes economic sense as well. As I pointed out in my first post on this topic, large AI projects have been abandoned because of unmanageable bias. By dedicating resources upfront, you can avoid losses due to abandoned projects.

"https://theventury.com/blog/anomaly-detection/","TheVentury","Machine Learning Prague 2019 – Anomaly Detection","After my first blog post “Topic Modeling” , I would also like to shed light on another extremely exciting topic: “Anomaly Detection”. which was another highlight of the “Practical conference about ML, AI & Deep Learning applications” – Machine Learning Prague 2019 , which we attended from February 22nd – 24th, 2019. I would like to briefly explain what Anomaly Detection is and then give you some examples! Here we go: Using Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection Anomaly Detection is a topic that I think is becoming more widely used. There was a very interesting presentation by Vítezslav Vít Vlcek from Broadcom called “Data-driven System health determination in Monitoring Softwares for Operational Intelligence”. The general idea is to use past data to decide if new data are conforming or anomalous.Here are a few examples where Anomaly Detection would be useful:Anomaly detection for Systems protection One common use of Anomaly Detection is to protect systems (server infrastructures, networks, etc.). This was the example on which Vítezslav based his presentation. His program uses a pattern matching algorithm inspired by the wave function collapse in Quantum Mechanics.This basically means, that his matching algorithm compares chunks of past data to new data to determine if it fits – somewhat like a puzzle. When a hacker attempts to enter the system, or it becomes unhealthy for some reason, the program detects an anomaly.The subsequent actions then depend on the needs of the customer, it could alert a systems administrator or take more drastic action such as logging out all sever users. Very useful!Anomaly detection to identify fraud Another important application of Anomaly Detection is fraud detection, which is probably used by your bank (at least I really hope it is). If you have ever received an email or call from your bank after making a strange purchase, it is probably because an AI algorithm decided that it was anomalous.Such a system collects data from purchases made through the bank and compares new purchases to the past. Such algorithms are becoming more widely used to protect people and systems from malign behavior.Predictive Maintenance applicationsWhat the presentation also made me think about is “Predictive Maintenance”. Here the algorithm records data from a machine to determine if it will break in the near future. For example, vibrations, mechanical tensions, and the sound it produces are continuously measured. The past data are used to determine if the behavior of the machine has changed and if maintenance should be undertaken.Perhaps the methods described by Vítezslav could be used for predictive maintenance as well? By intervening to fix a mechanical problem early, you can prevent costly down-times that are incurred when a part completely breaks.We are excited to keep exploring the many possibilities in this field of Machine Learning in the future!

"https://theventury.com/blog/behind-minds-investors/","TheVentury","In the minds of investors","The fourth post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.I got the chance to pick the brains of a few venture capitalists in Vienna to try to see their side of the picture. What do these investors see in such a vibrant emerging market?Venture Capitalists in ViennaNow that I have a better grip on the funding situation, it’s clear to me that progress is being made and that at the seed level, entrepreneurs are getting the cash injections that closely resemble those in the Bay Area.It is more than just cash, however. Investors are interested in your startup’s success, so they don’t just throw a check at you and send you on your way. They care about their money, so they do what they can to help it grow.Angels operate in the same way. As soon as they invest, they’re a part of your team and your operations. And everyone, all the big names especially, like to invest on the side: From Jeff Bezos to Zuckerberg or even Magic Johnson (seriously), their investments give the money and help that they need to break into the 10%.I sat down with a few venture capitalists based in Vienna. I wanted to see their side, to understand what they look for in a startup, and to hear their thoughts on the market here.The overriding bit that you probably could have guessed: Venture Capital in Vienna consists of almost entirely early stage investments. Confirmed!David, a managing director at Push Ventures, explained to me that he was the third member of the Push team. After the two founders started a nice fund and started gaining some traction in Vienna, they brought him in due to a lot of his insights with other European venture arms such as Gruenderfonds, a Bonn-based fund with a branch in Austria as well.He emphasized that this is, in a way, a university town—the University of Vienna does have a whopping 190,000 students—so there are clearly a lot of educated people looking to work. ViennaNaturally, students and graduates play a large role as interns and full-time workers for startups. With so many young minds in one place, they contribute a lot to the ideas that David might be considering investing in.But as David spoke about looking for “exit-oriented” teams with a leader that has it “figured out,” I wonder about how a student in his or her twenties can commit to an early stage startup looking to stay until exit.And as Push usually limits their investments to under $500,000, are they planning on holding their startups hands for five to ten (or more?) years until exit? It didn’t quite add up to me.Calmly, David explained how the smaller ventures such as theirs help in the transitional stage to bigger capital. “We never turn our backs on them… but once they get so big and have so many more investors, there will have more help than just us.”Essentially, they could be the smaller amount of money that allows a startup to create or really refine the product that they can show to the bigger funds later—it’s not an exact model, I know, but it’s a blueprint for transition at what can be the most critical stage of a startup’s existence.I left with a better understanding of that transition and the role that small capital can play. So moving forward, I had a lot of questions for both Markus, who does due diligence for Speedinvest, and Nina, a Speedinvest Principal.Markus explained that a lot of the early-stage money to be raised in Austria is about the height of what a startup can get here before they “graduate” and raise from another source.Nina concurred, explaining that “We [Speedinvest] focus all over Europe, but we mostly stay under three million with our investments.” She’s been with Speedinvest for more than 5 years, and seen first hand their fund 10x in it’s second round.While they might be looming over what Push Ventures can offer, they aren’t exactly late stage.If they’re looking around Europe and not limiting themselves, do they need to fend off other funds from taking their deals? In the overall European venture world, even Speedinvest is beaten by plenty of other firms in terms of fund size. And if Push is even smaller… does it get pretty cutthroat?Nina tells me that they’re happy to work with other funds, and David explained that if another group wants to back an interesting startup that it’s often a good sign—if you’re not the only one seeing the potential, it’s probably there, right?If you can’t beat them, join them—having a team of funders behind you can be an unbelievably huge advantage.The most important topic I wanted to discuss was people. What do they look for in a founder, an analyst, a principal?A company’s culture, to David, is much more important than their idea. He said he wanted to find those workers who were essentially willing to do whatever it took to succeed.Nina agreed, and expanded a little bit on the Speedinvest team. “We don’t take bankers,” she explained. (Did I say I’m majoring in finance? I was kidding). They want people who are relatable albeit unique, and between the two, of course, extremely driven.I asked all three of them, Daniel, Markus, and Nina, if they would prefer a bland founder with a market-changing idea or a market-changing founder with a bland idea. All three preferred the better founder. “People like that can do amazing things,” says Daniel. Clearly, it’s important to have the right culture from the beginning, because you can’t just go back and re-engineer it. In their eyes, the founder creates a culture as much as he or she does an idea.I got a lot of good insights from them. We see pretty clearly that the startup scene here is young but once again, we see that it’s growing. And if it’s being backed by the eager and excited VCs that I’ve met so far, it’ll continue that way.Does this mean that I won’t see the next unicorn being backed by Speedinvest or Push? I wondered, heartbroken.Each smiled at that, giving me the similar forms of “Perhaps one day.”","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0555_EAP_180215_TheVentury_Elevate-377x220.jpg","December 22, 2017","en",0.990826785564423,0.00196768093519495,0.673836410045624,0.0111764803295955,0.313019506633282
"https://theventury.com/blog/bias-in-ai/","TheVentury","Bias in AI – A deep dive","An article by TheVentury’s Data Scientist Josh Kunkle. He is an expert in Natural Language Processing for bots and development of Machine Learning algorithms for classification and image processing. Josh is currently also researching dialogue and robotic management systems.How do we ensure that Artificial Intelligence represents humanity’s best principles?What does “bias in AI” mean and how do we eliminate bias from AI and what are the sourcses? Let’s have a closer look!Introduction to Bias in AIIs there a simple solution?Computers to the rescue? Not so fast!Sources of BiasConclusionIntroduction to Bias in AIEnormous progress has been made in Artificial Intelligence (AI). With better algorithms, more data, and faster computers, companies and organizations are investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make business decisions. However, there is a pervasive problem in AI – Bias. A biased AI may perform poorly, but beyond that, it can inherit Humans’ prejudicial biases. When an AI is perceived to make prejudicially biased decisions, users lose confidence in it and usually it is abandoned.This has happened in some of the largest tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft. This occurs despite the fact that humans may be just as biased. This is because we tend to hold AI to a higher standard than humans, as we should.AI companies and developers need to put in the time and resources to ensure that their product best serves the needs and morals of society. It is therefore time to pay attention to this problem and try to find ways to manage it.Is there a simple solution?As a tech person, I like to use technology to solve problems. There are in fact many tech solutions that aim to address bias, but in a narrow fashion. As I’ll discuss in more detail below, once you start thinking critically about bias in AI and where it comes from, you are led to consider other areas of the business. Finally, you realize that bias is everywhere and that a tech solution alone is not sufficient to solve this broader problem.Before discussing the topic further, I would like to explain what I mean by bias in more detail because it is an overloaded word. I do not mean bias in the mathematical sense, instead I mean bias in an algorithm that produces unwanted outcomes. More specifically I want to address prejudicial bias – outcomes that disadvantage certain groups of people.Sometimes this type of bias is instead referred to as fairness. Nevertheless, it is easier to say ‘bias’ than ‘lack of fairness’ so I’ll stick with ‘bias’. Dealing with prejudicial bias is difficult because it is ingrained in human nature. People and societies must consciously work to eliminate it. While progress in the right direction continues, the previous and existing bias persists in the data that we record. Computers to the rescue? Not so fast!Since bias is introduced by humans, we might hope that computers will solve our bias problems. Even though humans try to be aware of their biases, we may become less vigilant when we are tired or distracted by other problems. Computers do not get tired, hungry, or grumpy; they just rely on the algorithm and the data (watch out for memory leaks though!). However, the algorithm and in particular the data are the routes by which bias creeps in to AI. One of the starkest and most famous examples of this was the Tay bot. Tay was developed by Microsoft with the goal of learning to talk like a Twitter user by learning from twitter users. Within 24 hours of deployment though, the bot was disabled because it made racist, sexist, and generally offensive tweets after learning such language from other users. This example is quite extreme because the developers maintained no control over the training data (it had initial training before deployment, but then it learned freely). Problems with AI in HRAnother, more pertinent example can be found in Human Resources – a growing target field for AI. We also see the growth in the field through our accelerator ELEVATE, where 3 out of 5 AI-startups in our current batch are HR focused. A common desire is to automatically process CVs and choose the best candidate for the position. To learn which candidates best match, historical hiring data is used. However, in many tech firms (which are the ones trying to adopt new AI technologies) there is a historical lack of female hires. If this bias is not corrected in the data, the AI learns that male applicants are preferred over female applicants. This reportedly happened when Amazon tried to develop this kind of AI.Sources of BiasIn order to develop targeted solutions, I will start by breaking down the sources of bias and identifying how they can influence AI.1. History & SocietyIt is important to acknowledge from the beginning that prejudicial biases are deeply rooted in history and society. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that biases show up in many contexts. This does not mean that we should do nothing about them. Business and individuals alike should aim to address such biases in order to advance society as a whole. 2. Business ObjectivesConsider how prejudicial bias can enter through business objectives. While individuals or companies may not have an intentional bias, it is surprisingly easy for biases to hide behind business objectives. For example, a company wants to use sales data to direct development resources. The data analysis may lead to the company to direct its resources to high income areas. By ignoring low income areas their service will tend to disadvantage minorities, who, in some countries, tend to live-in low-income areas. This is already beginning to be a difficult conversation. From the business perspective this may be the desired outcome. Why should they develop services where they will not be profitable? From the perspective of the disadvantaged group, they have lost access to a potentially beneficial service. Moreover, the severity depends on the product and business model. On one extreme the disadvantaged group may have no interest in the service (for example, high-end designer clothing).On the other extreme a company that provides a public service such as internet access should aim to avoid this type of bias. When confronting this type of bias, a company must assess their own values and business model as well as the public response to their actions. 3. Learning BiasNow consider how existing biases can influence AI. The issue comes down to the fact that machines cannot learn on their own. Instead humans must design the algorithm and supply training data. The data reflect the realities of the possibly biased process that create it. We then give that data to a machine learning algorithm, imprinting the biases onto it. This is the case of the CV example that I mentioned above. 4. Sample BiasAI developers in particular must be aware of the ways in which biases can enter their algorithms. The developers make choices on what data to collect and reject which may lead to a bias. Sample bias can result in data that is not fully representative of the data used for prediction. For example, in order to train an image classifier to identify cats you supply it with many pictures of cats. However, if you forget to include training images of Sphynx cats (which have no fur – if you haven’t seen one google will not disappoint), your classifier will probably fail on Sphynx cats. Based on this example, sample bias may not seem to be prejudicial, but if you consider that certain groups of people may be ignored when collecting training data the link is clear. In fact there have been real cases where facial recognition algorithms were trained with faces from only a certain skin color.Not surprisingly, these fail to identify faces having skin colors that were not trained. Such a bias would have even more impact in the medical field. For example an AI could be used to identify skin melanoma. Such algorithms show promise to increase the chance of early detection, but must be trained against all skin colors so that some people are not left behind. 5. Measurement BiasAnother type of bias which is related to sample bias is measurement bias. This is essentially sample bias, but with a time component. This type of bias occurs when the data collection method or quality changes relative to the training data. For example, consider an AI that classifies images. The AI is trained with clean, high-quality images, but over time the camera gets dirty. The dirty images will likely fail the classification. Such bias can extend to prejudicial situations when using surveys, for example. If the survey questions change slightly or the survey method changes the AI that interprets the survey may acquire a bias. The takeaway is that in many conditions data taking conditions are not static and must be monitored.ConclusionTaken all together it is clear that a tech solution will not address the wider issues related to prejudicial bias. Biases are present in society and can be inherited or introduced by business practices or data science decisions. Addressing bias should involve all areas of a company from management, to data science, and developers. The upfront cost may be higher than expected, but weighted against the cost of a failed project, the additional cost is worth it. In my next blog post I will lay out a broad program – or at least some suggestions – for how to handle bias and ensure fairness when it comes to AI.

Or what Growth Hackers do differently from digital marketers?You are not alone!But don’t worry. In around 2 minutes you will be released of the unknowing.Firstly, both types make sense in different scenarios as you will find out – however, Growth Hacking abilities will be more practical and necessary in the next few years, should the world keep changing as quickly. Don’t believe me? Read for yourself:Let’s start with the difference between Growth Hackers and digital marketers.How Growth Hackers differ from digital marketers:Data drivenTech-savvyT-shaped: knows all channels, but has dominant skillsEager to learn and CreativeTesting all the timeThey only take action based on data-proven results.What digital marketers exactly are:Specialists in one or two channelsTradition in finding marketing solutionsEconomic or Sales backgroundPlanning long term/whole campaignsThe bottom line is: while digital marketers follow a long-term path and develop entire campaigns, Growth Hackers take baby steps to achieve one and one thing only – growth. Now that we already have an idea about the main differences between Growth Hacking and digital marketing, let’s dive deeper.What is Growth Hacking?If you might think it all comes down to one awesome idea and bam: Instant growth – You are wrong. Sorry! Growth Hacking is a never-ending process. A process that must be measurable, testable and scalable.During this process the Growth Hackers takes baby steps to be flexible and quick. For example: If you build a start-up from scratch, you don’t have the time nor the money to create long-term campaigns. Growth Hacking allows you to test whether your hypotheses are right and what helps you with growing your business quickly and with little money. What is digital marketing?Let’s start with the biggest advantage and difference to Growth Hacking – Branding.Digital marketing is still the best way to brand your business and build awareness.While Growth Hacking is fast and concentrates on single tactics, digital marketing keeps brand awareness and its necessary strategies in mind.The job of a digital marketing manager is to acquire more users/customers by maintaining the brand reputation. SEO, Social Media, Pay-per-Click and Content Marketing are the main campaign types digital marketers use to achieve that. Digital marketers are more focused on branding, storytelling, long-term thinking, and emotions.The 3 Main Differences between Growth Hacking and digital marketing:Growth Hackers and digital marketers may use the same channels and have similar personal traits, but their ideologies are very different.Focus on the FunnelWhile digital marketers only focus on Acquisition and Activation of users, a Growth Hacker will always think about the whole sales/product funnel. They invent strategies and tactics to convert a potential customer on the whole user journey.Aquisition: acquire new and many customersActivation: make customers use your product or serviceRetention: make customers come back or re-visitReferral: make customers tell their friendsRenvue: Earn real moneyTechnical BackgroundDigital marketers are usually non-technical people, which leads to them often relying on developers, designers, and data scientists to implement their ideas. Growth Hackers, on the other hand, are tech-savvy and can execute their ideas on their own.However, that also means that Growth Hacking is not an inherent gift. Digital marketers can still become Growth Hackers if they have a strong analytical and technical mind.ProcessesAs explained above, the two types of marketers pursue the user funnel differently. Digital marketers are simply generating leads. In other words, they make people want the product.Growth Hackers work together closely with developers and define the product based on data. In plain English, they produce a product people want. ConclusionEvery Marketer can become a Growth Hacker or transform their current tactics into Growth Hacking processes. You don’t need to fulfil all requirements at once – baby steps are the first steps towards becoming a Growth Hacker.

"https://theventury.com/blog/bot-analytics-optimize-bot/","TheVentury","Bot Analytics – How to optimize your bot","It’s all about the numbersThe basis for improvement in any endeavor is being accurate and well informed. Whether that endeavor is improving a serve in tennis or increasing sales in an online store, tailored and specific feedback is essential. This is just as important when refining chatbots.Which is why we put focus on analytics for bots in our accelerator program. At our last meetup for ELEVATE, keynote speakers Klemens Zleptnig, Toni.ai and Tuba Tezer, botanalytics discussed how to use analytics tools for bots and what metrics to track to optimize chatbots.Klemens recommends using Google Analytics. Not only is GA free, but it also has a great user interface and extra features. Although it wasn’t designed for chatbots, there are easy workarounds that make using GA a viable option. But there are many more bot analytic services you can look into:Bot KPI’sWhile using analytics tools, there are several key performance indicators (KPIs) chatbot developers should think about:average session lengthnumber of messages not handled by a botmost active hourstotal number of messages sent/receivedresponse timeretention ratedaily new usersThese are all valuable statistics for chatbot developers seeking to optimize their product.However, it is apparent that there is not a perfect combination of KPIs for every chatbot. For instance, if a chatbot oriented towards companionship has a higher number of total messages sent per conversation, it is a positive indicator. In a different category such as customer service, however, that could be a negative.For example, using the case study of a pizza-ordering bot, the most active hours are one of the most important KPIs. Before sports games and in the evening are the most active hours for pizza orders. So chatbot developers can use this information to re-engage their users through push notifications or reminders.The primary takeaway? It is crucial to view analytics as an integral part of bot development. This involves identifying which KPIs are most important to your business model and developing the bot in accordance with that data.Get ready to tap into the potential of analytics and the opportunities it can open up for your bot business!Interested in more details or have any questions?

"https://theventury.com/blog/botbase-chatbot-framework/","TheVentury","The BotBase – The Enterprise-Ready Chatbot Framework","Please go to www.botbase.tech for updated information about our latest venture BotBase!Hello, BotBase!TheVentury is proud to tell about our experience in developing bots by releasing the very first blog article about our proprietary Chatbot Framework, the BotBase. Through an intense journey working with start-ups and established companies for almost two years, the development team of TheVentury discovered particular requirements that start-ups and corporates have a like.The lowest common denominator of the start-up and corporate ecosystem determine the functionalities and application programming interfaces that our very own BotBase provides.Over the last second years we developed the BOTBASE towards an interface agnostic platform that provides the opportunity to operate with a multi-platform approach that ensures a consistent user experience across channels like:Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Web Interface for your website,Whatsapp, Slack, SMS, E-Mail, Skype & Skype for Business,Voice Interfaces like amazon ALEXA. The Chatbot Framework: Technical PerspectiveFrom a technical perspective the chatbot framework is written in node.js, a programming language that is based on JavaScript. This server-sided software development platform enables the BOTBASE to create a fully-horizontal scalable and resource-efficient architecture that corporates and start-up teams require both alike.Since the BOTBASE is delivered as a dockerized application the advantages for server administrators and developers are obvious:Rapid application deployment due to minimal runtime requirements that reduces size and allows to be deployed quickly. Portability across machines since the application and all its dependencies can be bundled into a single container that is independent from often upcoming compatibility issues. Version control and component reuse by tracking successive versions and easy roll-back to previous options. Minimal overhead & simplified maintenance due to non-existing application dependencies. By deploying the DOCKER container on-premise TheVentury ensures to be GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant in terms of data-storage and data-processing. Since the requirements towards non-cloud technologies are mandatory, especially for sensitive data sets, the BOTBASE provides strong support for on-premise deployment and works seamlessly across on-premise infrastructure.As we know from talks to various corporate innovation leaders that triggering custom events such as Cronjobs and a full ENTERPRISE LOGGING are requirements that need to be part of the package to fulfill policy requirements and a seamless integration to the existing architecture and business processes.The requirements of clients from very different industry verticals led us to the decision to built our BOTBASE platform agnostic in terms of NLP (natural language processing), ANALYTICS and CRM (Customer-Relationship-Management) / ERP (Enterprise-Ressource-Management) integrations. Why is that?Because we believe that different solutions provide different strengths that can, if used and orchestrated right, be leveraged to provide our clients with the best possible solution available on the market for the demanded use-case.By integrating connectors for different Natural Language Processing / Understanding solutions such as the IBM Watson Platform, Googles NLP Solution, or our Partners such as RASA (Open-Source-Software) and DeepSearch, our clients are able to cherry-pick their preferred solution.Microsoft Azure Bot & Cognitive Services enables us through the BOTBASE to Microsoft Bot Framework integration to give our clients the opportunity to make use of their Microsoft Suite and deploy Bots for Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business with direct connection to Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and other applications without losing the flexibility that is necessary to be ready for the challenges that they might face in the future.The modular architecture of the BOTBASE makes us as flexible as our clients demand us to be. Our mantra: Always stay agile!We know how difficult it is to be flexible within a corporate legacy system. <U+0001F609>Thinking of building a bot for your project?Let’s talk: maximilian.unger@theventury.com","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sharon-mccutcheon-532782-unsplash-377x220.jpg","February 6, 2018","en",0.994821786880493,5.47903327969834e-05,0.86106675863266,0.000634191499557346,0.13824425637722
"https://theventury.com/blog/ceos-at-riseconf/","TheVentury","What the CEO of Tinder, Air Asia & Giphy had to say at RISE!","RISE – the largest tech conference in Asia!3 days, 3 nights, 16,000 attendees & 350 speakers!Where? In Hong Kong – where East meets West! Truly.When we attended RISE from July 8th – 11th, we did not only introduce our latest venture BotBase but also got a chance to listen to some highly influential speakers, founders, CEOs! I would now like to share some interesting insights with you!Tinder CEO – Elie SeidmanLaunching “Lite”Some months back the dating app announced its plans to expand to the Asian market. At RISE the CEO mentioned, that the next expansion was going to be in Vietnam with “Tinder Lite”. This version of the app would have almost the same features but would use less battery and data (up to 20% less than the full version). However, in order to ensure that the app works with slow internet networks, it will have to remove the “Tinder Feed”.Elie Seidman, Tinder CEO at RISE 2019A similar announcement was made by the Spotify Global Head of Markets, Cecilia Qvist, who spoke about launching Spotify Lite in Asia and also spoke about the successful expansion to India, where they were able to acquire 1 Million users within the first week of launch.The two are following the footsteps of Facebook, who launched Facebook Lite in 2015. Great examples of companies not only customizing their products in terms of content adaption to local needs but also thinking about solving issues that prevent users from having a good user experience.Now let’s talk about the real reason why you came to read this blog post. Secret tips about getting more matches by the CEO of the most popular dating app himself, right? No, of course not. We know that’s not why you are here, but just in case you were wondering, here you go:Increasing your chances to get matchedThe CEO of Tinder was asked to share the big secret. How can users increase their chances to get matched? Spoiler: it’s not really a big surprise and hardly a secret.He said that from looking at the data, it is very clear to see that people talking about their passion in the bio field have a higher success rate than users who simply upload a head-shot image. There you go. He confirmed something that has been a long-time rumor. Uploading a picture alone apparently is not enough.He also mentioned how “the desire to create a human connection is not a new idea” when he was questioned what intentions he had while founding the company.Besides launching the Lite version of Tinder, GDPR has also been on Tinder’s agenda in the past months. “We choose to comply with GDPR globally”, he explained. They have aligned users in protecting their data while helping them find online connections. It seems that GDPR compliance is becoming a feature rather than it just being about privacy.AirAsia CEO – Tony FernandesThe Malaysian low-cost airline is headquartered near Kuala Lumpur and is the largest airline in Malaysia by destinations. What makes the company as successful as it is? The CEO Tony Fernandes shared his secret to success at RISE with the audience and wow, he is one of the best story-tellers I have ever come across.PeoplePeople are at the core of innovation and success, Fernandes explained. He shared that keeping an open door and ensuring the development of his staff is what enabled AirAsia to reach the height of success that it has. Caring for the staff is critical and not something you do because it’s “nice”. My personal highlight – him mentioning how you have to look worse than your employees in order to be approachable. By that he meant “dressing down” rather than showing up to work in a suit and tie every single day. Tony Fernandes, AirAsia CEO at RISE 2019Simplified BrandingWhat played an important role for AirAsia was also the evolution of its brand identity, Fernandes explained. “Coca Cola only has one logo, so does Shell or Apply” – then why invest in multiple images or logos? Keep it simple. He simplified the branding and created a strong identity by sticking to one color and one logo only.Giphy CEO – Alex ChungAnother really great speaker, Alex Chung, CEO & Founder of Giphy. If you are ever at a conference where you see his name on the Agenda – make sure to attend!In a round-table session, that he was leading he was asked about his secret to success. His answer: “I worked on 200 different ideas, this one worked out and took 5-6 years to become successful”.Well, that was a very honest take, people thought, who were hoping to hear something more magical. I guess the magic lies in the product and the ability to integrate it on different platforms. Starting from Facebook, Whatsapp to Zendesk. Alex Chung explained how messages that include gifs have an 80% higher response rate than text-only messages. Everyone talks about the growth of video, gifs are part of the same medium.Alex Chung, Giphy CEO at RISE 2019GlocalizationWhen asked about whether users would use “local” gifs more, Chung explained that emotion-based gifs would work equally well if they weren’t local but when looking into action-based gifs, local content would work better.Here are some fun-facts:There are differences in the use of gifs in the morning. In India for example, there is a huge spike for “morning gifs”, since Indians tend to send each other “good morning” messages on a daily basis.In the United States, the coffee gifs are most popular in the mornings.In Korea, people don’t send gifs in mornings at all.To sum it up3 very different companies, 3 very different CEOs. What they all had in common? Their focus on creating better user experiences, strong brand identities and thinking globally by adapting to he Asian market needs.More blogs from our Asia trip:Also have a look at what the which Tech Trends were discussed by Uber & Googleand what we learning about Innovation in Hong Kong & China.

"https://theventury.com/blog/chinahongkong/","TheVentury","Exploring innovation in Hong Kong & China!","10 weeks ago, we decided we needed to explore the Asian market while preparing our pitch for our latest venture BotBase at the RISE conference in Hong Kong.Why the interest in the Asian market? Well because if you think about it (and its size), it almost feels ignorant to not be interested in a huge market with a lot of potential. We decided to pitch BotBase at RISE and use the two weeks we are there to explore Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai.What we learnt on our first few days there already: there is a LOT that is going on there. We got to see and understand many cool things happening in the innovation & start-up space. What exactly did we find particularly interesting there? Well, we have put together our key learnings, experiences of our trip and the most impressive facts for you.<U+7CA4><U+6E2F><U+6FB3><U+5927><U+6E7E><U+533A>Greater Bay Area – Market power & sustainabilityLet’s begin with the famous “Greater Bay Area”.Bay Area sounds familiar, right? But why “Greater”?In 2017, during the 13th five-year plan for economic and social development, China announced to form a megapolis that consists of 9 cities and 2 special administrative areas, kind of a megacity in the already most dense region of the world.The goal: to foster economic potential condensed in an area with combined 70 million people, nearly 5 percent of the overall mainland china population that occupies less than 1 percent of china’s land area but contributes 12 percent of GDP.This really Is GREAT, right?9/9/6The government of mainland china takes innovation seriously. Politically, as well as economically a basis to foster entrepreneurship in all different kinds of areas Is truly provided.Moreover, the entrepreneurial zeal of the Greater Bay Area is hard to compare with other hubs in the world. Even if you hustle hard!Ever heard of 9/9/6?China always had the reputation of putting work before life.9/9/6 at a Chinese company means that the workday starts at 9am, finishes at 9pm, with an extended 6-day week.One of the expat founders from the United States who we met in China simply described the ‘brutal truth’: “My engineering team works hard. There are some of the brightest minds in our industry and they grind daily. You still can’t compare it to a start-up driven by the Chinese 9/9/6 culture. If you work hard, they will work harder. It’s pure competition.”<U+9999><U+6E2F>Hong Kong – one country, two systemsWe spent most of our time in Hong Kong and truly fell in love with the high energy of the place. What we heard almost every day during our time there was people referring to their constitutional principle “one country, two systems“. Within the People’s Republic of China, socialism is maintained, while Hong Kong can retain the capitalist system after peaceful unification.If you look at the start-up ecosystem and take a closer look at the corporate innovation projects of established companies in Hong Kong, this difference to China becomes very clear.Many projects revolve around Blockchain, Fintech and other fields that require much more liberal conditions which are available in Hong Kong, more than in other parts of the world. Not without good reason, Hong Kong has been ranked number one among the economically most liberal cities in the world for several years.Starting a business there Is very easy and only costs ONE obligatory Hong Kong dollar. Yes, we completely understand If you are now considering opening an office In Hong Kong. We were constantly playing with the same thought. They make managed to make It very tempting for entrepreneurs.This is probably also the reason for the booming start-up ecosystem in Hong Kong. Last year alone +150% more startups settled in Hong Kong, over the last 5 years 300% more jobs were created in startup related companies. <U+6DF1><U+5733>Shenzhen – A full end to end ecosystemNow let’s look at one of the most interesting cities I have ever been to. Seriously!Back in the 70s Shenzhen was a tiny fishing village with a population of around 30.000.Around 10 years later Shenzhen became China’s first special economic zone, which made Shenzhen grow on an astounding rate year per year. Latest estimates count about 12,500,000 people living in the urban area of Shenzhen.Basically, Shenzhen became the number one hub for serving the world with electronic consumer goods, the biggest hub for hardware startups and the gadget factory of the world.Although there is good reason to skeptically question the development of Shenzhen, the growth miracle “made in China” produces the highest per capita income in whole China, lifted (together with the whole economic development of China) around 800 million people out of poverty.But Shenzhen is not only about economic growth!Maker Spaces in ShenzhenMakerspace “Troublemaker” in ShenzhenThe advantage for start-ups from all over the world that drives them to Shenzhen becomes clear when talking to entrepreneurs in one of the in the city located Maker Spaces.A hardware entrepreneur (start-up still in stealth mode) from California told us: “Compared to the US, we can make our products four times as fast with a tenth of the costs. The time of the ‘copycat stereotype’ approach is over – the Chinese ecosystem understands quality more and more as an advantage and focuses on increasing in this area.”Learn more about Shenzhen in a nutshell here:SummaryIn retrospect, our trip to Hong Kong and China was very educational and really widened my horizon. We were able to bring back a very different mind-set of some highly inspiring people we met there and are looking forward to maintaining the relationships we built there.In numerous conversations it became clear to me that China, also due to the strong influence of the government in economic topics, pursues a clear focus with a lot of power: Interdisciplinary collaboration and a stable infrastructure provide the basis for rapid growth, sustainable development and a perspective that may leave the West far behind.China is creating a new sense of community on the road to an affluent society. ‘Don’t give a hungry man a fish, Give him your fishing rod.’More blogs from our Asia trip:Also have a look at the insights the CEOs of Tinder, Giphy & AirAsia gave at RISE and which Tech Trends were discussed by Uber & Google!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1512446387219-99c19f8fe95f-377x250.jpeg","July 23, 2019","en",0.995412647724152,0.0141380583263526,0.685024172067642,0.0224292455241084,0.278408497571945
"https://theventury.com/blog/choosing-an-accelerator/","TheVentury","4 things you should consider before joining an accelerator","If you have founded a startup, have just started working on an idea or are trying to find to expand to a new market, you might considered joining an accelerator. But when’s the right time to join one? And which one is the right one for you?Running ELEVATE, our accelerator for early-stage AI startups and for almost 4 years now, we have read through hundreds of applications and interviewed almost as many startups. Running a community of different accelerators, we know how diverse accelerators can be and how hard it is to pick the right one for your startups. So today, we want to give you some pointers on what to pay attention to when picking your accelerator. Let’s get into it.The stageThere are definitely differences in the stages accelerators focus on. From problem-solution fit, to investment-readiness, to partnering up with corporates on concrete projects, different accelerators have different target stages.So before applying for an accelerator think about the stage you are in, your goals for the next year and the steps you need to be taking to get there. Does the accelerator fit these goals and next steps? Will it help you get there? If you are not sure, reach out to the accelerator team and ask. This is also a great way to learn more about how they interact with their potential participants.The focusPick any topic that comes to your mind and I am pretty sure there is an accelerator for it out there. Specific industries, problems they are focusing on solving, technologies, you name it. Pick a focus that’s important for your startups’ future and growth. Whatever the focus is, you’ll meet lots of other people from the same area there. Startups working in the same field or on the same technologies, experts & potential clients from that area, so pick it wisely.The offerThere are different accelerator models out there – some invest money or working time, some offer advice and workshops, some take equity, some don’t. Again, think about what you need at your stage. Money is usually the shiny thing that attracts startups first, but make sure to look beyond the surface. Is money really the thing you need most at your stage? Maybe the access to a network of investors and/or potential clients is more important at your point? Other accelerators invest in hands-on services, helping you build and grow your product.Check them all closely and ask yourself if the value you get out of it is worth it to you.The peoplePay attention to the interactions you have with the accelerator. Be it answers to your first emails or later on in your interviews. Are they asking you interesting questions? Are they genuinely interested in what you are doing? Are they adding value in this phase already, maybe challenging you, maybe giving you advice?Depending on the accelerator, these people might be invested in your startup in the long run. So make sure you would be happy having them on board for longer than the duration of the program.A great way to learn more about the people but also the overall value of the program is to talk to alumni. Just ask the accelerator team for a connection to some alumni. In most cases, this won’t be a problem and will give you another chance to observe how they interact with their alumni.ELEVATE Just in case you were wondering about how our accelerator works…For ELEVATE, we focus on early-stage startups working on AI solutions. Given the stage our startups are in, we are specifically looking at the team and the progress they have made so far. What we are specifically and most importantly asking ourselves in the interviewing phase are the following things:Can we add value for this team at their stage, with their specific needs and their set-up?How is the team dynamic within the team? Do we think this team is flexible enough to work with curve balls? Would we like to work with this team on a personal level?When have they started and what have they achieved so far? What are their biggest learnings from the early stage and how have they adapted to it?You can find out more here: elevate.theventury.comWe hope this short article will help you to pick the right accelerator for your startup.

Like, annoyingly hard.The odds are stacked against students who don’t have enough preparation or information on how to prepare.This is the gap that David Coates tries to fill with Chooter. His A.I.-driven tutoring tool provides individually fitted classes based on your target university and personal knowledge.In his post-month-1 interview he told us about the biggest learning he had as well as his F***-Up.50% off on MarketingThe learning that astonished the CEO of Chooter the most, is the fact that marketing does not have to be expensive. Naturally, thinking about marketing, stuff like Google Ads and Facebook will come to mind. But virality isn’t bound to the amount of money spent!Are ads really the best way to reach your audience? Chooter’s target audience are students, a group that is already actively discussing the problems that David solves – So it makes sense to be active on these Social Media pages – To take part in the discussion and finding potential leads. Cost = 0€Think about what’s most effective, not what has the most splash in your bank account Underestimating existing business contactsThe main mistake David talked about occurred during the validation phase: Obviously validation requires doing extensive market research as well as approaching possible users and competitors to receive feedback.Now – being keen on doing all that – David forgot a rather simple thing: There’s usually already people that did the legwork! There will be people that operate in the same field and may be willing to share some valuable information.So be sure to check with other companies that might already have gained insight in the topic – You might save time and money.The problem with remote staffDavid is working together with various students from all over the country: Young and talented people that are keen on helping with the project. The problem: They are scattered all over the country!Now, meeting everybody in person would have required much time – time that David did not have. So he skipped on meeting his employees and experienced the #1 problem of working remote: The staff will quickly feel disconnected from the project rather than feeling fully involved. That’s why he can only emphasize: Keep the people close and take the time to get to know them in person!Month 1 – The verdictDavid states he learned a lot in the first month and underlines the importance of staying open minded. Especially in the validation phase he learned to be confident in his product, but never being afraid of being wrong. In perfect ELEVATE-fashion he ended the interview with a great tip for future participants:Build – Measure – Learn and you will fit in perfectly with the ELEVATE team","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lean-startup-summit-2-377x220.jpg","November 30, 2018","en",0.995573222637177,0.00718431640416384,0.802250027656555,0.0142289642244577,0.176336646080017
"https://theventury.com/blog/company-culture/","TheVentury","What I learnt about TheVentury in my 8 weeks!","Hi, I’m Sam from MinnesotaEvery intern feels the same way for their first day on the job.Anxiety.A bit of fear.And a lot of excitement.You don’t know what the job will entail or how the employees will accept you. Which can be stressful. Eight weeks ago, this was me.Coming from the U.S., I wasn’t sure how I would fit in, or if I would fit in at all. However, after over a month at TheVentury, I can confidently say that all the worrying was for no reason.TheVentury is just different, they’re unique. Spend an hour as a fly on the wall here and you’ll see how they’re family. And in this family, everyone genuinely enjoys what they do, and they enjoy working here. As an intern, I’ve noticed quickly that there are endless reasons why people love to work at TheVentury.There are endless reasons why I love it too. However, since I don’t have endless space… I’ll just give you my top three (in no particular order).The WorkloadMy actual work desk, this picture was taken while writing this.I can still recall my interview with TheVentury right now.When asked what I wanted out of an internship, my response was that I wanted to contribute. I wanted to do work that would benefit the company, as well as aid my learning and growth as an inspiring marketer.TheVentury has given me that opportunity and more.Back in the U.S., I know plenty of interns whose day is comprised of filing paper and fetching coffee (Adam, if you’re reading this I apologize). That is not something you’ll get working here at TheVentury. In my short time here, I’ve done work that has made me proud and feel accomplished. I have done work that has helped me develop and learn. Do you know that type of work that when you finish, you have to sit back and admire it? Yeah? That’s the work I’ve been given the responsibility to accomplish.InclusionBe E.P.I.CE- Entrepreneurial ThinkingP- PassionateI- ImpactC-Cooperative and EmpoweringHere are TheVentury’s core values. To be EPIC.However, if it were up to me, TheVentury’s core values would be “to be E.P.I.C.I”. With the additional I – and that stands for Inclusive. As the youngest and lowest ranking person in this office, you’d assume I would be looked over and disregarded. That is not the case whatsoever.Here, I am treated like a friend, and as an equal. The people that makeup TheVentury view me as part of the team, and that is a special feeling, especially in the workplace.For example, during daily team stand-up meetings, developers like Jakob Reiter and Tatyana Sandanova truly seem interested in the work I’m doing. Just as interested as I am in what they’re doing- and they’re doing some really cool stuff! The fact that I’m given a part in these standup meetings is really meaningful for an intern. I am included and viewed as an equal, and that is very motivating.Company CultureIn sports, the teams with the best locker-room culture, tend to be successful. These teams are organized like a well-run business and succeed because of it. In the NBA, the San Antonio Spurs are a prime example of this. Their culture is why they have been the most successful basketball organization for the past decade.The Spurs have:Excellent leadershipIncredible teamworkMost importantly, strong relationshipsThese features define the Spurs culture, and they win because of it.TheVentury is like the Spurs.From my four weeks here, I have noticed plenty of comparisons between these two businesses’ and their work environments. Culture is really about the people within the office, and the relationships they foster.It doesn’t take long for you to realize the people in this office are extraordinary, and the relationships they have with one another are truly genuine.These friendships allow for great teamwork on any project, and the freedom for an individual to step up and become a leader. This level of trust and cohesion between colleagues is a clear indicator that the culture here is second to none.ConclusionI’ve come a long way since my first day on the job. That anxiety and fear I mentioned earlier has been entirely erased. Since that first day, I’ve been completely embraced by everyone at this company, and as a 21-year-old intern, I cannot appreciate that enough.In my first few weeks, I’ve learned a lot as well. Everything from marketing tactics to company culture has helped me develop and understand the world of business more. Which I believe should be the goal for every intern.I’ll leave you with a picture of the Saubär (the bear who reminds us to keep the office clean) Enjoy!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1449449-377x220.jpg","July 1, 2019","en",0.995975017547607,0.0111170986783691,0.105442868545651,0.197053259820677,0.68638676404953

Easy peasy. Before logging out you go back to your Shoe Paradise shopping cart to see whether the order has been processed correctly. Prize – Correct. Address – Check. Product image – What? Why did the colour suddenly switch to gold? The order has been placed and is up for delivery. Online shopping is super easy, but what on earth will you do with golden shoes?What do you do now?You try to call the customer service. But after queuing for 10 minutes and paying 0,30€ for each – listening to the same sequence of classical music over and over again – you are close to giving up. Suddenly, service agent Melanie responds with a friendly voice and you explain your problem. Then she reconnects you to another department because she couldn’t help.You explain everything again – this time to Bernhard. He´s not too friendly – must have had a tough day. He connects you to Petra.Petra explains: They are having issues with the e-Commerce platform and are trying to fix it. She asks you to send a message to the complaint inbox – the tech team will take over.You reach out through another channel: the complaint inbox. Again, you briefly explain what happened and ask for a colour change back to blue. Answer pending.Nowadays, we have chatbots which can solve your golden shoe problem in a time span no longer than having a coffee. Just have a look:Customer service bots read or listen to your messages, connect the information to your customer profile and immediately understand the issue. Your order, your problem and needs – You say it, it’s done. No matter the channel you use to reach out to Shoe Paradise, the multi-messenger platform connects the dots. Never tell your story multiple times repeatedly, just lean back and let the bot work its magic. Does the bot not know the answer yet, the question is forwarded to a customer service agent.What modern data-lovers enjoy most about this?First of all, on TheVentury’s botbase framework your data is safe and cannot be seen or used by any third parties. We´re fully GDPR-compliant.Secondly, the human part of the customer service chain can trace back all requests and information that was already transmitted in a chat. This seamless customer service experience heavily increases happiness – for customers and employees alike. Service employees are still highly important, their work just got more efficient and enjoyable.Thirdly, the bots improve their service quality on a daily basis and learn from every issue. This will make your shopping experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible. What a time to be alive. Dreaming of bots?

"https://theventury.com/blog/demo-day-1/","TheVentury","Demo Day Batch #1 Recap","After 6 months of coding, business workshops and pitch training – the day had finally come. On September 8th we opened our doors to invite a selected crowd of VCs and business angels to the Arcotel Donauzentrum. The new tech hotel of the Arcotel group was the perfect match for a Chatbot Demo Day.Investors Master ClassThe day kicked off with an exiting keynote from Kaj Hagros – seed investor and CEO at Pivot5. Kaj founded 8 companies, served 30 boards and had several successful exits. He flew in from Helsinki to talk about his angel experiences and chatbot investments in Finland. As investor, the most important investment criteria for him is:He argued that many teams are so excited about their concept, that they fail to see the importance of a smart go-to-market strategy. Also, he pointed out, investors should only invest in domains that they fully understand.‘There used to be an app for everything. Now there is a bot for everything.’Kaj talked about the many use cases for chatbots: from equity research to AI-based health assistance. However, he highly emphasised that a bot itself, is not the business itself – it is a way of reaching and engaging with your target audience.The potential of chatbotsThe keynote was followed by a panel discussion by:Kaj Hagros – CEO at Pivot5Wolfgang Bosch – Business Development Executive at IBM WatsonNatalie Korotaeva – Facebook Developer Circle Vienna LeadMarc Isop – Chief Revenue Officer at Onlim The discussion gave interesting insights into the potential of bots in the corporate and startup environment. Furthermore, the panellists discussed the role of women in the chatbot community and whether the majority of bot personalities is male or female. All speakers agreed that there are many use cases for bots, but that ‘building a bot company’ should not be the ultimate business goal – a chatbot makes sense if it is the best way to reach the consumer.Pitch your botAfter a short coffee and networking break, it was finally time for our teams to step on stage. Our 4 chatbot companies had to face a though jury:Selma Prodanovic – founder and CEO of 1MillionStartupsNina Wöss – Principal at SpeedinvestKaj Hagros – CEO at Pivot5The jury had some tough but fair questions for the teams, and pointed out that all pitches were extremely well done and interesting. After the last pitch, the vistors and people watching the livestream were asked to vote for their favorite pitch. Team Jingle collected the most votes and therefore received a hotel voucher from Arcotel Donauzentrum.After that, the official part of the Demo Day was over. Food and drinks were served and TheVentury invited everyone to a fun afterparty in the first district.We think that the demo day was a huge success. We received amazing feedback from visitors, our jury and the teams. We are extremely happy to release 4 market-ready bots to the world and we are keen to see them live their full potential! We will further support them and their way and will integrate them in the Elevate Alumni Group – they will always be important members of the ELEVATE family!You couldn’t make it to the Demo Day?

"https://theventury.com/blog/design-thinking/","TheVentury","Design Thinking – Approaching problems from your users’ point of view","Not only did she explain the topic to TheVentury in a 4 hour long workshop recently, Kathrin Zirn even agreed to an interview on the topic of Design Thinking. So Kathy, what exactly is Design Thinking? Design Thinking is the I- düpfele on top of innovationWhat our Swabian colleague is trying to convey is that design thinking is the icing on top of a delicious problem-solving cake. Now, as that still might not explain everything, let’s start with a better metaphor.6 blind servants and an elephantOnce upon a time there was a king living in a far away land. He had heard of legendary creatures roaming the lands of Africa and wanted to know what they looked like. So he sent 6 of his most loyal servants on an expedition to come back with an accurate description of an elephant. The catch: All of them were blind. Then what did they tell him once they returned?“Elephants are equipped with giant ears!” said the one, that had been assigned to feel up the elephant’s head.“No, they are just a tale with hair at the end.” explained the one that had angered the animal by pulling its tail.“On the contrary!” the third one exclaimed “They are just one big fat mass!”“You are all absolutely right. That is an elephant.” the king calmed down his servants.So, what’s the lesson?It is all about perspectiveWould only one of the servants alone have gotten the right picture? Absolutely not. They were all approaching their task, their problem, from a different perspective and just by combining each individual solution managed to fulfil what they were sent to do. That is the premise of Design Thinking. You can never perfectly solve an (innovation) problem without some extra insights. Or by changing your point of view and taking your users’ position. Here’s what you do: You will first explore the problem from your users’ perspective, assume their POV and then get to work. This is called the “Double Diamond”: We’ll broaden your spectrum, then narrow it down and focus. Then we will broaden your mindset with excessive brainstorming, then you test it.DISCOVERFind out what your audience’s problems and pain points are. Conduct interviews, send out surveys, ask for feedback. Just listen to them! You can only solve problems you are aware of – And you only have to solve problems that actually exist.EMPATHIZEGain a deep understanding of why this is a problem. What exactly are your users’ expectations? What do they want? Try to understand what pains your users. Really understand and feel with them. This will make you thrive for a solution.DEFINECombine your empathic feelings and compelling motivations with rational thinking and scope a specific challenge. This often requires reframing your previous thoughts and looking at them through a more objective lens – But it will enable you to finally get to work.IDEATEBrainstorm. Mentally go wide and document everything that comes to mind – as crazy as it might seem. That’s the goal: Think outside the box, drop the focus and go wild on your mind maps. You may or may not catch a gem.PROTOTYPETime to get your hands dirty, figuratively or literally. Bring your idea into the physical world, be it with post-it notes, Lego, forming it with clay or doing an interpretive dance. Discuss. If you forgot – This is a team activity. Resolve discussion, start a conversation, get rid of bad ideas quickly.TESTFeedback- time! Talk to other people, be it your users, other problem-solvers, your boss or your mom. Is there anything you overlooked when building your prototype? Anything missing? This phase helps you with refining your point of view and gathering more information. But most importantly it stays true to our mantra:BUILD – MEASURE – LEARN Interested in learning more about Design Thinking and its possibilities?Contact us and we will get in touch!

CEO David and CTO Mike saw the potential in the eastern European market and match their clients with their perfect partner.Validation at ELEVATE- batch 3They themselves recently matched with ELEVATE – as one of batch’s 3 contestants. In our interview they talked about the first month, the struggles of validation and how they wanted to make their website stand out.As a reminder: The first month was all about validation – Building an MVP and approaching customers to receive feedback. That is usually already the first point of traction: People usually don’t enjoy receiving phone calls to answer questions.Yet, David and Mike pulled through and talked with clients and potential clients about various topics:What are their needs? What pained them when searching for coders? What did they think went well in the cooperation? What did not work out?This is all important information to put into validation in order to create a suiting product. And, even though David had to accept lots of rejections he managed to gather valuable data.

And, let’s face it: Those are usually pretty boring; an issue Mike is aware of.

Which means there is more work waiting for Valentin Aschermann. He is first in line to explain the accelerator’s advantages, the risks of starting a business and how to handle them through validation & experimentation. So, Valentin – how do you feel about this Batch?“Batch #3 of ELEVATE is looking Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!”Now, this might seem like a pretty audacious statement but coming from a man that knows the Startup-industry like he does, it might even be an understatement.After founding his own startup SIMPLEWISH following his graduation in 2012, Valentin decided to move on and became a startup consultant and program manager at INiTS, Vienna’s high-tech incubator. He worked with around 50 startups and helped them grow from an idea to a fully validated business model – experience he now implements as head of Startup Services at TheVentury: He is involved in all offers towards Startups as well as in ELEVATE.ELEVATE is an accelerator program that in a first step helps startups with systematically testing out their most crucial hypotheses through qualitative and quantitive experiments & validation. Then, once problem-solution fit is found, it’s time for execution: We provide startups with a senior developer as well as a growth hacker and they are ready to start accelerating their development. That’s what makes ELEVATE special – it provides the resources startups are so desperately looking for.Hypothesis-testing as a solution to de-risking failureFollowing their very definition, Startups are exposed to a lot of risk based on uncertainty, the liabilities of newness and smallness – but most importantly the founders’ bias. Valentin proposes hypothesis-driven validation as solution to the problem – Translating founders’ visions into critical assumptions and testing them through experiments. In this process founders continuously de-risk and learn, helping them with preventing problems in the long run.“I wanted to ingrain a feeling for the importance of this data-driven approach.”, Valentin says. “We went through a fuck-up story so founders would realize how an invalid hypothesis and the wrong approach can cause failure.” Planning isn’t the answer to high uncertainty – Learning is.So what tip can you give founders, Valentin?To quote Steve Blank: There are no facts inside the building so get the heck outside. – There is no value in theoretically approaching a topic without any knowledge, so get out there and don’t forget to stick to the “Lean”-approach: Build – Measure – Learn!

Telling a story is not about explaining, it is about getting your audience curious to learn more and go the next step with you. You will never be able to explain anything sufficiently in a pitch.Let me tell you a story: Once upon a time there was a group of ambitious, hardworking entrepreneurs. They had a great idea and provided an invaluable service – yet they did not have any success when pitching their idea. They tried to convince people, they explained their vision – Nothing seemed to help.Until Michael Buchecker came around – and explained them good storytelling.The power of storytellingSee what I did there? This blog could have started out the old-fashioned way, but that wouldn’t really have caught your interest – would it? That’s what we learned in Michael’s ELEVATE workshop – how to build your story and get others excited about your idea.His #1 tip to share with a founder:Don’t explain. Never. Storytelling is not about explaining, it is about getting your audience curious to learn more and go the next step with you. You will never be able to explain anything sufficiently in a pitch.Why does that matter?“Simple – you can have the best idea in the world, if you can’t get others excited about it, you will sell yourself short.” Well-prepared communication is sadly often underestimated: There is a lot of examples of ideas and products that failed due to ineffective communication.Over the years Michael Buchecker has worked with around 250 startups – most of them from high tech areas that provide products that are hard to explain. In workshops and coaching he taught them how to find their own compelling startup-story and how to pitch it to an audience.Michael Buchecker on ELEVATE Batch 3“This year’s batch is amazing!”After having worked with various incubators and accelerators over the years Michael decided to share his expertise with batch 3. In his opinion, the focus on bots and applied AI as well as the provision of growth hacking and development support clearly differentiates ELEVATE from other accelerators.When asked what comes to mind when thinking about the “Lean”- model taught there, he smugly replies by quoting Back to the Future: “Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need roads.” – Lean means effective and important: the best ideas are not worth anything if they don’t solve a problem. Being aware of what value you really provide to your customer is critical for positioning and finding your story. So, what is your story?

Do you need to build a fancy product with extensive capabilities or did you completely overshoot and miss the core value your audience needs? As always with the lean approach, the answer lies in testing – you need to find out what your customers need and what exactly works for them. So how do you do that? You build an MVP – a minimal viable product, a topic Valentina Gredler is an expert on.Valentina on MVPsMy name is Valentina – I have been a Growth Hacker for more than 4 years now as well as being a mentor for the ELEVATE program.Affectionately called Vali by colleagues, Valentina has worked with start-ups on every project imaginable. Over the past few years she has incorporated various growth hacks, has done online and offline marketing as well as worked with PR: Always with the businesses’ growth as her absolute goal. Now, as a mentor for ELEVATE, she does not only help founders with marketing but also with business evaluation and strategic decisions.During her workshop for Batch 3 she helped our start-ups with creating their own MVP as well as showing them ways to get people to test it.Vali, why is creating an MVP so important?Testing out your business hypotheses is crucial – not only do many start-ups develop irrelevant products, many fail to see what their core audience need.

She told us about her product, her recent f***ups as well as Espresso Labs cooperation with ELEVATE so far.There will be f***ups, there will be roadblocks – but there will also be accomplishmentsEspresso Labs – Voice Applications for enterprisesA relaxing day at the hotel, what more could you ask for? How about a voice-controlled personal assistant in your room? This is what Espresso Labs can do for you.Vijay Nandwani, Shubhang Arora and Pallavi went out to provide convenience to customers as well as to ease coordination efforts for hotels. For that purpose they founded Espresso Labs, targeting higher-rank hotels and providing voice applications for their guestrooms.By customizing Google Home as well as Amazon’s Alexa they enable customers to simply voice service requests while the hotel staff is notified momentarily. Thus, cutting out a lot of time and effort needed to request and book certain services.Elevating the businessAfter putting in 7 months of work prior to the program they joined ELEVATE Batch 3 in October and promptly saw results. The 1st session was all about validating your MVP, so that’s what they did:Together with their coaches, Bernhard and Tanya, they built a demo video with Google home that helped hotels with upselling their services. The feedback received after sharing the video with the Espresso Lab community was astounding – it even led to a conversion!Hyatt Regency – one of the highest reputed hotels in Dheli and the national capital region decided to become a pilot tester. They wanted to have the device installed in 10 of their premier suites, which would be a breakthrough with any startup. But, as it goes, it also lays the ground for their recent f***up story.The Google struggleThe Espresso Labs team agreed to deliver 10 Google Home devices ready and going within two weeks to the Hyatt Regency. Standard procedure – preparing and providing 10 devices within two weeks would pose no hassle for the young entrepreneurs.Hadn’t Google interfered with the plans.Google home only provides an application for doing bookings and reservations in early access so far, with strictly limited access. Espresso Labs was not among the lucky bunch, Google denied their application.Solution: Switching over to Amazon’s echo, which meant acquiring ten of those, as renting the devices to the hotel was part of the deal. After then, things were sailing smooth.That’s how things are in startups, they go south – you as co-founders have to find a solution for it.Espresso Labs conquers EuropeSince already before coming to Austria Pallavi and her team have been in contact in Viennese hotels – exploring the hierarchy, building relationships and testing the market. Our hotels might become a lot more convenient in the near future – Espresso Labs is a team that is keen on finding their way into the European market.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/alexa-voice-assistants-scaled-377x220.jpg","November 15, 2018","en",0.990095734596252,0.0111613813787699,0.76306688785553,0.0554090924561024,0.170362681150436

It’s all about curiosity for innovation, startups, technology, digital marketing and more. Sounds like it’s made for us and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, naturally.Here a few highlights if you couldn’t be there:Getting Things Done (GTD) with David AllenThe author gave us fantastic insights how to stay relaxed, focused and in control. We enjoyed his book just as his talk. We can fully recommend the book to get your stuff done without stressing out.Hacking Powerful StrategiesWe learnt how to apply FBI hostage negotiating tactics to business transformation and how to gear our minds towards exponential transformation.The 5 steps:Active ListeningEmpathyRapportInfluenceBehavioral ChangeThe point here: You have to go through all 5 steps from the beginning, otherwise the change you intend won’t work. True for organizational change, but weirdly also fitting for your customer experience. You can’t start influencing right away, you gotta start with listening and empathy before even attempting to influence people’s behavior in certain direction.Make or BreakAn Era of tranformation and Change with JP Kuehlwein and Erich Joachimsthaler. The duo made the case that we’ve arrived in the third era of connectivity:The Everything Connected EraWe’re leaving behind The Internet Era and The Social Era. They further argued that the key in this era lies in building an ecosystem for your brand and focussing on your purpose.It’s all about the Why!The Future of Voice Interfaces with Malte KosubVoice interfaces are becoming a huge thing with the rise of Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa pushing the market very fast. We totally agree with Malte, who suggests that now is the time to:Identify current and future use casesbuild technical infrastructurecreate a sound identityWe’ve got startup and enterprise solutions for that btw <U+0001F609>HumorThe missing skill for success and happiness at work with Andrew Tarvin:This was not the only talk at fifteen Seconds on humor in leadership and the workplace in general. We totally agree with Drew, having fun at work is a key component for success and contributes to a performant team culture.Humor makes it easy to get rid of unnecessary tension, makes everybody connect on a basic human level and just makes the whole experience much more enjoyable for everyone.Don’t try too hard, but better a bad dad joke than nothing.In any case, we’ve had a wonderful time at the festival, which provides us with an awesome space to connect with fellow innovators, techies, marketers and curious minds of all sorts.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/personal-3286018_1920-377x220.jpg","June 14, 2019","en",0.98925644159317,3.59816767740995e-05,0.00278644636273384,4.85705568280537e-05,0.997129023075104

The keynote was held by Ben Goertzel, book author and Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics.If this rings any bells, you might know Sophia, a humanoid robot designed to look like Audrey Hepburn:Ben emphasized the importance of general AI. The AI we are using and advancing right now is narrow AI. It’s the type of Artificial Intelligence that is good at carrying out specific tasks, such as Alpha Go is better than humans at playing the board game Go.General AI, however, will be able to generalize tasks and also be able to perform when conditions of the tasks change. Ben predicts general AI to take off in the next 3 to 8 years – a paradigm shift that will have a huge impact on human nature. When asked if this doesn’t scare him, he simply said ‘General AI might be scary and dangerous, but so was evolving out of caves’.Of fear about job loss and future applicationsAnother topic raised was the fear that AI might take away people’s jobs. Ben laughed and said: ‘ 10 years ago, everyone was afraid that AI might kill us all – like in the Terminator movies. Now, everyone is afraid of loosing their jobs. What are they afraid of – being unemployed the 10 years before the machines kill them?’According to Ben, the future applications of AI are exiting and widespread. The topics he is most fascinated about are humanoid robots and the combination of AI and humans (eg. A neural race à la Elon Musk). The latter could help humans to keep up with AI. However, Ben raised a certain issue: not all people might want to be ‘transformed into a cyborg’ and might resist against being advanced by technology. Ben argued that these people might not be able to keep up with the mental capacity of the once deciding to opt-up.He jokingly said ‘maybe there will be a Zoo of non-technology users’.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/daniel-plan-OE7jKpsk7uU-unsplash-1-377x220.jpg","April 20, 2017","en",0.99395740032196,4.75713495688979e-05,0.786503255367279,0.00138035020790994,0.21206884086132
"https://theventury.com/blog/get-ready-for-voice-search/","TheVentury","Get ready for Voice Search!","This article will give you insights about how to optimize your website for voice search and how voice SEO is gaining more relevance in 2020. We’ve come such a long way. Since the days of early voice recognition as a dictation tool, through the first releases of Siri and other voice assistants, to the ever-present voice-enabled speakers we see today – we’ve watched voice shape up as a legitimate and socially accepted form of input over the past years. As the accuracy and availability develops more and more by the day, people are increasingly using their voice assistants and smart speakers to search the web. But this presents a whole new set of challenges that you’ll need to overcome. Voice SEO doesn’t play by the same rules as regular SEO.But there are some measures you can take to make sure this trend doesn’t leave your website at the seventh page of Google’s search results. In just a few simple steps, you can get your SEO ready for the future! Let’s first understand why voice search is important today. How big of a deal is voice search?Voice Search has been around for a while, but never really taken off as a main way for people to search for things online. That’s probably because voice recognition technology hasn’t always been as accurate and fast as it’s become today. Combining that fact with the increasing presence of voice-enabled devices in the household, it’s easy to imagine that we’re going to start seeing more searches leaving the confines of text. There is a frequently misquoted prediction that voice search will cover a whopping 50% of total searches in 2020. This forecast came from Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu, and was specifically based on the state of voice and image search in China. The global reality, across both mobile and desktop, is a bit different. That being said, the share of voice searches is steadily growing, and to ignore its rise would be just as foolish as to parrot misinterpreted predictions.Out of voice searches, 60% are predicted to come from screenless devices like the Amazon Echo, or Google Nest Hub. The repercussions of this are significant for SEO and keyword optimization. Where typed-out search queries are often carefully crafted and rather formal, voice searches are more conversational and casual. Most voice searches start with the word “how” and are three times more likely to be geographically specific than text searches (often ending with modifiers like “near me”). Screenless search results may also mean that search marketers need to consider how they structure their meta descriptions. Maybe we’ll even see web standards proposed to help search engines navigate and deliver voice search results. In any case, change is coming! Voice <U+2665><U+FE0F> ScreenWith the emergence of smart speakers that also have screens, we’re seeing an interesting opportunity to augment voice apps with visuals. That’s interesting because, according to Tobias Dengel of Willowtree, the average person can type 40 words per minute (wpm), but speak 130. Conversely, we can read 250 wpm, but can only listen to 130. Just based on the math here, you can see there’s a big potential for applications employing voice recognition and visuals together. Voice SEO recommendations Let’s get you started with some easy first steps: Write content in a natural, conversational tone – it’ll be more likely to match what users voice-search forFocus more on semantic search – you can read more details about this here, but generally, make sure you use your content to answer people’s questions clearly and concisely, and use internal linking strategically.Try to work more on user intent – Figure out what you users search for, and make content that answers these questions. This will increase your chances of making into to the top of Google’s search results, and maybe even to Result 0. You can do research about this using a tool like AnswerThePublic. Include longer tail keyword phrases to reach users – Extra points if everything matches up – Search query, title, body text, URL!Integrate Structured Data in your web pages to help search engines – Here’s a great blog from Yoast to help you understand how this works.Start working with SPEAKABLE property in schema.org to provide identification for sections that are suited for audio playback using text-to-speech (TTS) – this will provide a great user experience on voice-enabled devices and may lift your chances of reaching Result 0.These few tips will already make a great effort towards making your site more future-proof. Generally though, it’s safe to say voice search is not the reason you aren’t getting enough search traffic today. First and foremost, you still need to optimize for text search, as the main search mode in 2020 – but it can never hurt to be prepared for the ever-changing future.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/computer-767776_1920-377x250.jpg","March 17, 2020","en",0.996100246906281,0.434062593725685,0.387342052534223,0.00471195284626447,0.173883475363255
"https://theventury.com/blog/growth-hacking-explained/","TheVentury","What the (growth) hack? Growth Hacking explained!","Even today, so many traditional marketers and managers still think about growth hacking or growth marketing as some sort of fluffy trend that belongs to the startup world. What we see from such conversations is that people still have many misconceptions around the topic of growth marketing.Actually, companies all over the world have been choosing this approach for almost 10 years now. That’s why we’ve decided to pick this topic up again and go back to the basics. This article answers the question of what growth hacking actually is, while explaining the core principles.BUT PLEASE, SOME STORYTELLING FIRST!It was in 2010 when Sean Ellis published a blog article explaining that a growth hacker “is a person whose true north is growth. Everything they do is scrutinized by its potential impact on scalable growth.” And so, the term growth hacking was born and many people within the startup scene positively responded to the concept.A huge number of articles, books, experts and companies successfully dedicated themselves to the topic in the following years. You may have come across names like Eric Ries and Neil Patel, who contributed in spreading the idea on an international scale. Eric Ries mainly made efforts in the field of entrepreneurship, while Neil Patel developed himself as an online marketing icon especially for SEO.Well-known and established companies like Dropbox and Airbnb applied the growth hacking technique to their business back in their early days, and still do so. Some may say that this approach played a vital role in becoming one of the highly valued tech unicorns. So, as you can see, it’s not only a success story of specific people or companies. It is also one of a business concept.OKAY, OKAY, ENOUGH OF THIS HISTORY LESSON. LET’S LOOK INTO WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!Basically, growth hacking is a marketing technique that is used to generate growth for your business. To do this, it combines various disciplines ranging from IT to marketing to controlling. It’s a data-driven process of rapid experimentation along the whole marketing funnel and across all channels to identify the most efficient ways to grow.<U+0001F646> You only have one job – or, well, one goal.Ideally, every company has at least one goal that it strives to reach. All functions and processes within the organization should be aligned in contributing to this goal. This is also true for growth hacking. Its only purpose is to contribute to this goal – AKA North Star. Growth hackers identify related metrics, and build an agile strategy around it that aims to enable them to succeed.<U+0001F50D> It’s about understanding the world, so it imitates science.Companies and their managers do have a certain understanding about their customers and the market they operate in. Sometimes these understandings are valid knowledge that was gained with great effort and experience. Other times, these understandings are simple assumptions that have never been proven. And sometimes the world we operate in changes and valid knowledge becomes obsolete.In science, we try to understand the world better. Scientists dedicate their lives to exploring our reality, finding patterns and proving them. Thereby, hypothesis-driven testing is key. In growth hacking, we choose a similar approach as we try to understand customers and markets better. Furthermore, we also want to find efficient ways to grow our business. So, a growth hacker formulates hypotheses about possible causes and effects, and then designs experiments in which to test them. The decision of validating or rejecting a hypothesis is always data-driven and evidence-based. Just like back in science class.<U+2764> It’s actually a love-story between marketing and product development.As mentioned before, growth hacking is an interdisciplinary field and not exclusive to marketers. It often interlocks marketing and product development with the goal of finding the perfect product-market-fit. In doing so, the marketer and the product developer work closely together. They use growth hacking techniques to validate whether what is built or developed is actually useful to the end-user. Developing, marketing and user feedback goes hand in hand. This helps to constantly receive feedback that confirms or rejects hypotheses and enables the product to be adapted to the market strategy accordingly.<U+0001F3A8> Stay curious, stay creative.Successful growth hackers are constantly on the lookout for new ways on how to reach their target audience. Thereby, staying up to date on the latest developments and innovations in tech and marketing are crucial. Additionally, the ability to creatively combine elements is key. Simple techniques as brainstorming with the team are used to come up with ideas that then are being tested. The key here is to think about ideas along the entire funnel, not just awareness or acquisition.<U+0001F389> Work your way through the funnel!At the core of growth hacking lies the marketing funnel. It describes the customer journey from the first contact point through the conversion, and all the way to the referral of a new customer. Growth hackers think along the whole funnel and understand that customer behavior changes throughout the sales process. This is also why growth initiatives are always set according to the stage of the funnel the target audience is currently in.There are several funnel concepts out there, which all have the same direction but slightly differ from each other. Moreover, not all address the requirements for growth marketing. At TheVentury we prefer working with the AAARRR Pirate Metrics by Dave McClure that goes beyond the simple process of awareness and conversion. It also includes stages like retention and referral, that are also on the growth marketer’s checklist.<U+0001F4C9> Yes, it’s all about data and metrics.To prove your assumptions right or wrong, and to be able to evaluate your initiatives as accurately as possible, it is important to track them. Tracking and analyzing user paths is the only way to understand user behavior and take the right steps. If it’s not worth measuring, it’s not worth doing. That’s why a big part of growth hacking involves collecting, organizing and taking action based on all kinds of data.<U+0001F4A5> Experiment, measure, optimize fast and often.The last crucial thing of growth hacking is to get into the so-called growth process or cycle. This means that growth teams begin by brainstorming as many ideas as possible. They then assess effectiveness and efficiency by looking at gathered data and adapt their initiatives accordingly. Failures are as much a part of this process as successes. The more you test, the more learnings you will gather, and this ensures a higher probability of finding the sweet spot for growing your business.Help me grow my company!WATCH OUT FOR MORE!As you can see, growth marketing is simply a mindset or approach you choose on how to do marketing, which maximizes growth in an efficient way. At TheVentury, we think that it is the best technique to reach your company goal and to stay ahead of your competition in this fast-changing world.

"https://theventury.com/blog/how-to-make-bots-that-dont-suck/","TheVentury","Smartup Time  – How to make bots that don’t suck","Smartup Time at TheVenturyAt TheVentury, we believe that investing in the development of our employees is key to create value for our customers and the community. This is why we recently started to block four hours a week for every Venturer to do some research and gain new knowledge in fields where they want to improve, or in which they are interested. We love to learn new things and are proof that lifelong learning is not just an empty phrase. Since we try to give our clients as much knowledge about their project as we can, people are also highly encouraged to share their insights and takeaways from their research with their colleagues in form of small talks or workshops. In that way everybody benefits from the new gained knowledge of others, which also has a direct effect in improving our daily tasks and projects. This time our focus is: bot design.Simon Morel on Conversational Interface DesignOn Friday, we were lucky enough to hear from bot designer Simon Morel, partner & Head of Product at BotSupply some insights on how to make bots ‘that don’t suck’! The key takeaway is that when you are developing chatbots, you are designing an experience for the user, and you need to ensure that you’re adhering to design principles that have evolved in other spheres. Bots should be for everyone, and you need to design them appropriately.Simon was keen to stress that bots are just a small part of AI-powered solutions, which will fundamentally change how we interact with computers – bots are, in many ways digital spokespeople for brands and organisations, and they should link to other AI-powered solutions within this role. This means that for bots, conversations are at the forefront of the way that users interact with the AI, so the focus on design needs to be on that, before you even get to the AI.In the same way that we saw the transition from digital to mobile, we’re going to see the transition to AI, an insight also noted by Amir Shevat in Designing Bots. No industry is going to be unaffected – we won’t be able to imagine life without it. Simon’s perspective is that a chatbot is not just a bubble showing up on a website or within Facebook messenger, we don’t want to be limited. Current criticisms of bots tend to assume a simplistic view of bots, and don’t take into account that bots will soon use not just text, but also voice, eye movement, facial expressions, body positioning and hand gestures, and that AR and VR may soon have a big part to play, though Simon lamented that in Denmark, support for Danish voice conversations is lagging behind a bit!You don’t need a computer to start designing a botSimon pointed out that when you’re designing a bot, you need to start with an analogue fashion (pencil and paper) – it’s faster and more accurate, and makes it easier to start working on the bot immediately. Don’t start with the copywriting or the character, since they will change rapidly and are no good as a foundation. Instead, start with conversational flows, and literally draw them as flow charts. Only once this has been finalised do we move onto the digital stage.Apply the principles of character design in games and filmAfter this, you can design the character. Though sometimes we as designers don’t get to create the character at all, we should try to use what the medium of chatbots affords. Every interaction with the character should take the person into account that they are trying to imitate – what is the brand, what is the person, how do they sound? If this sounds familiar, it’s because these principles follows those of character design from games and film, and the lessons learned in that medium are just as applicable here.The bot’s function follows the data and the designOnly after all this has been completed, Simon emphasized, we move to AI. AI must follow everything else, but it can’t be forgotten – if we don’t have any tech between the data and the design, it doesn’t matter how well-designed the concept is! Designers need to remember that AI isn’t magic, though. If we want a chatbot to be super-specific, then we need the data to back it up, otherwise we can never train the AI.Finally, Simon closed by looking to the long term, and how to ensure that a bot doesn’t just die out as a flash in the pan. He returned to the idea of character design, and he questioned whether that should change as well? How do you do it without annoying the customers, and without people losing interest? Ideally, he stressed, you’d have 5-10 utterances of the chatbot’s phrases, and everything else should be subject to discussion with the client or designer. If users aren’t interested, that might be because of the service, but it might be because of how the character presents itself.Since you read until here you are maybe interested in bots in general and writing outstanding characters for bots?

"https://theventury.com/blog/how-to-use-tiktok-marketing-for-your-startup/","TheVentury","How to use TikTok Marketing for your Startup","TheVentury recently had the pleasure to host Sophie Pineker, responsible for Community and Partnerships Europe at TikTok, for a super informative workshop here in Vienna. TikTok with its 5.5 million active users, is one of the fastest growing social networks in the world. The insights we gained were really valuable, and I thought we’d share a few with you!What I found most interesting was that TikTok does not prioritize videos made by your friends or people you follow in your feed. I’ll describe more on that below.You can’t ignore TikTok – let’s look at the numbersIf you haven’t heard of TikTok yet, it’s about time! With 5.5 million active users, who spend an average of 50 minutes on the platform every day, this new social media platform is growing bigger and more relevant by the day. The Verge calls it “a unique hybrid somewhere between Vine and YouTube that’s captured the cultural zeitgeist among teenage smartphone owners in unprecedented fashion.”TikTok boasts 9 billion monthly video views, creating the perfect platform for people – especially young people – to get their creative message across, but also for brands looking to connect with the next generation in a meaningful way.Typical content on TikTok is in the shape of 10-15 second videos, often accompanied by popular music tracks, and typically humorous or entertaining, so the bar is high for brands who want to build a following on this platform.There are a few social features that make the app unique, and any brand who wants to conquer the TikTok world needs to find a way to use them to their own benefit.The different formats1. First off: the “For You” page (#FYP) is the first thing a user sees when they open the app (even before logging in or registering!) Content here is algorithmically curated and anything that ends up here is bound to get way more exposure. It’s the goal of many TikTok users to get their content onto the For You page.2. TikTok has licensed a lot of excerpts from popular music and offers in-app video editing and effects. The result is a signature style of vertical video content that spans the entire platform, and makes it both recognizable and easy to replicate. Many brands are successful, not by producing high-value professional video content, but by simulating the hand-held amateur style of its own target audience. Essentially, the challenge here is to make your brand become “one of the gang”.3. Hashtag Challenges are the heart of a lot of the content published on TikTok. This is where one user posts a video of a specific style, and prompts other users (via a hashtag) to recreate the video concept, each putting their own unique spin on it. Brands can also sponsor a hashtag challenge, and in one example presented to us, TikTok even helps to connect brands to influencers, who can give the Challenge the initial momentum it needs to go viral.4. Duets are also a popular way by which you can publish your rendition of a song or video. The resulting post is a collage of your own video, side-by-side with a number of its predecessors.A lot of these features are a little difficult to explain – I recommend you just download the app and try it out!Paid ads on TikTokUnlike Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, TikTok doesn’t offer “self-service ads” to brands who want to market their products. It isn’t possible to log on, upload a video, set a budget and target a chosen audience, and have your ad delivering an hour or two later.Why? This is possibly due to the app still being relatively new – we may see them adding an ad option in that sense once the product matures a little. But for now, businesses need to be in direct touch with TikTok to get their paid content campaigns onto the network. TikTok even supports brands with creating content, so it can feel as native as possible.But this also means higher entry costs. In the example presented to us in the workshop, a well-known brand paid a five-digit sum to run a “Top View” ad, which is a format that completely covers the app interface when a user opens the app, and links to an external landing page. The estimated CTR lay at around 12%, and 3,7 million impressions were reached. Of course, these numbers vary by region and on a case-by-case basis (you can contact them if you’re interested). That level of exposure is fantastic for any brand, of course, but it naturally comes with a price tag.Organic reach for brands – Authenticity is king (or queen)Of course, if you’re a startup, those kind of costs may be a little risky, if not completely impossible to afford.Which options does that leave startups then? Organic, of course! Ask yourself: how can your business navigate the various trends, memes and challenges that dominate TikTok, in a way that makes you come across as a relatable and human user, while still bring across the brand message you want to bring, and in a perfect world, even converting users to your product?That’s the big question, and it’s going to take some experimentation to answer.It’s worth taking a look at some of the approaches brands have taken so far. Companies like Chipotle, the Washington Post or Guess have all been among the earliest adopting brands on TikTok, and each have given a unique spin to their content, while keeping the authentic, casual, humorous core that makes TikTok videos so addictive with its target audience.Approaches included:Engaging in existing Hashtag Challenges while featuring their productCreating their own Hashtag Challenges and boosting them with influencer participationCreating branded filters or stickers that other users can attach to their contentFunny “behind the scenes” posts from their officesHigher production value sequences involving influencers and celebritiesWhatever you choose to do, the golden rule is simple: try to make your brand feel more like a real life TikTok user!TikTok is about content, not connectionsThere’s one more thing that makes TikTok stand out from the rest. Where other social networks have been betting on the social graph, the model that represents interconnectedness of people online, TikTok content becomes successful by other virtues. On the For You page, TikTok’s algorithm decides what you’d like to see. It doesn’t prioritize videos made by your friends or people you follow. The videos are built by influencers, brands and random people trying their luck at TikTok stardom. Whether or not you get to see their video is defined by its overall popularity and its popularity in your region, not by how socially close you are to the creator.This can be great for brands – if they can manage to create awesome content, they don’t need to worry about it getting buried by content from a user’s social connections – this continues to be a challenge on Facebook, for example. The success of a given piece of content is much more strongly defined by its objective popularity and engagement.At the end of the day, TikTok is still in its early years, and it remains to be seen what features will still be launched, both B2C and B2B. But with its current rate of growth, its predominantly young following, and its features that set it apart from what’s already out there, ignoring it might be a mistake!Have you considered using TikTok for you brand?

"https://theventury.com/blog/ibindo/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: ibindo","Last month was the kick-off of our 2nd Batch of ELEVATE – Europe’s first Bot Accelerator. We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.It’s time for another team introduction. So let’s talk about ibindo, a chatbotservice on FB Messenger that helps people who are love sick. It combines systemic and behavioral therapy to guide and support affected people through the four phases of love sickness. Team ibindo consists of four lovely, diverse members from Vienna and Munich.Mel, one of the co-founders is a therapist who helps love sick people to understand their own emotions better and have a positive outlook. ibindo should do exactly that. What are your favorite chatbots?Mica (“the Hipster Cat Chatbot is a venue recommendation bot”) and Woebot (“an automated conversational agent chatbot who helps you monitor mood and learn about yourself”).If you were a bot, what would your purpose be?To help all people in the world to deal with their emotions. To give them a 24-7 platform.What’s ibindo’s superpower?The implementation of systemic and behavioral approach into conversational design is definitely ibindo’s superpower.What is the problem you are solving?Everyone knows the feeling where you want to simply talk about your break up. Not just for the few days after that but for a longer period.Our solution helps people who are lovesick, be it after a breakup or a divorce or in case of a unfulfilled love or ‘ghosting’. The chatbot is always there – unlike a friend who you may call once or twice in a moment of weakness at 3am. ibindo can always be approached.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a bot?Make sure to start with an easy-to-build prototype on a standard platform, gather as much feedback as possible and then take it from there.What are your expectations for the ELEVATE program?Our goal is to launch the chatbot succesfully in the DACH region by the end of the program and are very excited about that. We can’t wait to see how many people ibindo will help in the future!

A cat, named Poncho talks to you about a whole slew of things: weather-related and not.Greg Leuch – Poncho’s Head of Product and R&D – is one of our beloved ELEVATE mentors and sat down with us on his recent Vienna-trip to share his insights about bot design, onboarding, growth hacking and the future. Got a cup of coffee ready? Sit back and enjoy Greg’s interview!What is your most valuable tip or trick?Be real & be respectful! You cannot build a product, regardless of its content or medium, without being honest and respectful to your end users. If you assume too much, send too many messages, disparage them, or you’re just annoying, your product will not work. Act natural like a casual friend will always do better than any other conversational messaging strategy. Be real & be respectful! What’s your favorite thing about chatbots?I honestly enjoy that chatbots can be many different things depending on their use case. They can be available in a variety of formats, from voice skills to SMS notifications. Chatbots have the power to reach the user like any other person in their preferred messaging app.What I enjoy even more is knowing that we’re still in the exploration phase of how conversational interfaces can impact everyday lives. Newer technologies like augmented reality and holograms combined with conversational practices can bring a richer, more engaging experience that far exceeds what has been capable in the past 20+ years of the Web. The exciting times are just around the corner and we have the ability to make the future right now. What’s your all-time favorite growth hack you experienced at Poncho?There are many great engagement tactics you can explore with read receipt events that can be used to target additional content. You’ll see Poncho use these from time to time. But really, the best growth hack is to make your chatbot relatable with content and characteristics that build a bond with the user.The best growth hack is to make your chatbot relatable with content and characteristics that build a bond with the user. What would your go-to career choice be if you weren’t working in the chatbot space?Oh wow…what a tough question! I would likely be exploring other technologies to see how we can build playful yet useful engagement and tools for personal enrichment and utility. According to you, what’s the most crucial thing for a chatbot to work?The absolutely most critical component for any chatbot is the onboarding experience. It is the only way to get a user started. Any user that is unable to get onboarded will very likely never come back to chat. Your onboarding could fail because of language differences, wrong content, too many questions/friction, or may not be exciting, respectful, or real. Make a great onboarding experience and you’ll be rewarded with lots of further potential conversations with those users. What’s your first advice to someone who tells you they want to build a chatbot?My first advice to anyone building a conversation interface, whether bot, voice skills, or other conversation interaction is to not get overwhelmed with natural language (NLP), machine learning (ML) & artificial intelligence (AI). Many conversations can be handled through simple call & response dialog flows. You don’t even need a bot to start — just start messaging your friends and test yourself! Can you describe the Chatbot scene in Vienna in one line?The Vienna chatbot community is incredibly smart and supportive. Not only those in this space, but also for international colleagues like myself that have been warmly welcomed into the community. (You’re all amazing!) What’s happening at Poncho in 2018?I’m excited for our upcoming launch on Slack. Our team has spent a lot of time learning about what makes Poncho a great one-to-one messaging product and applying that into a multi-user workspace. We’re adding a lot of new exciting features to be more than just a weather bot. If you are interested, sign up to get notified!We’ve also launched a Developer API for select partners for our weather content & data. Sign up as well if you’re interested.

"https://theventury.com/blog/landing-page-hashes-for-seo/","TheVentury","SEO Quality Control: How to Use Landing Page Hashes","This blog post will explain, how to optimize automatically created pages for search engines by using landing page hashes. Automated SEO is on the rise. But did you know that Google stops indexing and even crawling your pages if they become too similar among each other? At a recent meetup of Growth Hackers of Vienna (GHV on Facebook), Search Engine expert Franz Enzenhofer explained how landing page hashes can be used as a great tool to ensure uniqueness of all pages. I have put these insights together for you in the following article.Why do I need SEO Quality Control?First things first. Before we look into what landing page hashes are and why and how you should use them, I would like to start by thinking about why quality control is essential. When Google crawls and indexes pages on the web, its highest concern is to deliver good value to its users. As the crawler is “only” a machine, its ability to judge a page’s quality is restricted and relies on certain standardized indicators. One of them is a page’s uniqueness: if a website’s pages and content are repeated over and over, it certainly does not deliver additional value to users. While this is typically not an issue for manually created pages, it definitely can be severe for:MarketplacesAggregatorsPlatforms of all kindsLarge e-commerce sitesFor example, this issue – also referred to as “self-spamming” – occurs if one shop category coincides largely with another category, and hence their corresponding result pages will overlap too. If Google recognizes this, it first stops indexing the pages in question, or worse, rejects to crawl them at all – which often defeats the very SEO purpose why these pages were created in the first place.What are Landing Page Hashes?Now let’s look into landing page hashes. In general, a hash function takes some input to calculate a unique hash value of some fixed size from it. In the case of Landing Page hashes, this input basically is the content of a certain web page, or a unique ID for each single item on the page. Neither for Google’s crawler, nor for the hash function, it matters how the single items are sorted on each page. Thus:A landing page hash is a sort independent and comparable identifier of the visible items on a list landing page.How do you use this knowledge?If the number of your pages to compare is limited – for example in the case of category results or list pages – you can resort to out-of-the box tools calculating page similarities. For instance, if you are concerned about two shop categories overlapping, you can use Small SEO Tool’s Page Comparison. Simply copy-and-paste your URLs to compare, and receive a similarity score. For example, if there is a lot of similarity, you can now readjust your categories to reduce the overlap and thus improve SEO.If the number of your pages is too large for these tools to handle, you (or your developer) will have to set up a hash comparison manually in your website’s backend. There, comparing landing page hashes represents a relatively simple, quick and scalable way to automatically check how similar each of your pages are to all the others – which would otherwise take an eternity for large platforms consisting of hundreds or thousands of pages.This can be done the following way:Assign each page element (for example products in a web shop) a unique ID and save this ID to a variable.Use these variables as input and call a locality-sensitive hashing function on them. Only locality sensitive hashing will preserve your pages’ similarity in a meaningful way (other hashes create huge variation even from tiny differences). The individual hashing function will depend on the programming language used in your backend (for example PHP or Node.js).Compare the hash of each page with all the other pages’ hashes, for example by using Levenstein distance, which represents a good measure of similarity.How to leverage these insights:Equipped with the insights of your pages’ similarity, you can:Rework your whole website’s hierarchy and SEO strategy to produce more unique pagesAdjust your list pages and (shop) categories in order to produce less overlap with othersGenerate an XML sitemap that only lets Google index the more relevant pagesFor example, you can adapt the script that generates new XML sitemaps – most probably overnight – to also produce a daily report on identical and nearly identical pages. If several pages are very similar, only communicate the more relevant to the search engines via the sitemap, or mark the less relevant ones “noindex”.For more details on using landing page hashes for SEO, take a look at Franz Enzenhofer’s article on Medium.com.If you liked this blogpost, stay ahead of the competition by following Growth Hackers of Vienna on Facebook, or join the LinkedIn Group!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/launch-rocket-spaceship-startup-business-PR7JGBM-scaled-377x250.jpg","May 15, 2020","en",0.994042754173279,3.18238585350628e-05,0.989495873451233,0.000882225926034153,0.00959007907658815
"https://theventury.com/blog/launch-startup-vienna/","TheVentury","Why should I launch my startup in Vienna?","The third post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.We know how vital funding is to every startup. As a developing market, it seems that Vienna is actually the perfect launch point for younger, seed-stage startupsVienna – from a startup village to an early-stage empire! Recently, TheVentury moved into its new office at weXelerate, the newest and biggest startup hub in Europe.So far, I like this place a lot. It checks all the right “entrepreneur” boxes: high and unfinished ceilings, well lit, startup ads everywhere, table games, and about three different open spots where you can grab a coffee. Not to mention the escalators make me feel like I’m in Tron.From the smaller, cozier office we used to occupy, we’ve moved into the largest hub in the city. If it looks like Silicon Valley and it feels like Silicon Valley, well, maybe we’re on our way…but I won’t get carried away.TheVentury’s beautiful new home, the weXelerate coworking spaceA startup’s ability to gain funding is absolutely vital at some stage in its existence. In Vienna, there are plenty of VC funds and angels looking for new opportunities, but it wouldn’t be the right place to look for late-stage capital. The largest VC in the country has a fund of about $100 million. While this is certainly a large pile of cash, it wouldn’t be able to support something like Snap’s series C of $50 million without a lot of help.Seed round funding usually falls pretty close to $1 million, however, and many are below. There would certainly be enough capital here to support a number of seed stage startups.I think it’s a good sign that a leading VC focuses the majority of its funds on seed investments. It shows that they are looking for the highest potential companies that also show rapid growth, that they’re turning over new stones instead of admiring the old.The Austrian government is beginning to notice entrepreneurial growth as well: in 2015, they granted $325 million to 3,715 startups. In this narrative, it seems, the government executives are the good guys. Imagine that you have a revolutionary idea, and you just moved to Vienna. You have a few friends interested in getting involved, but they insist that if you’re going to sell your soul to this idea, you should get started somewhere else. Why?Venture capital has a much bigger presence in Silicon Valley. There is so much capital available that a $100 million fund is not uncommon, maybe even scoffed at by some of the giants on Sand Hill Road.But let’s look at some of the seed investments coming from Sand Hill: Redpoint Ventures, $2.3 million to Lilt Inc. in October 2016; Andreessen Horowitz, $3.2 million to OpenInvest in May 2017; Greylock Partners, $1 million to Mira in September 2017. Now let’s check out here: Speedinvest, $1.9 million to ClauseMatch in June 2017, and $3.9 million to Inkitt in September 2017.Even though Redpoint has had ten funds ranging from $180 million to $750 million, they’re putting up the same amount of capital as Vienna-based funds for seed-stage investments.So why, again, would you need to relocate? Vienna is the perfect market for early- and seed-stage companies. There might be less competition for funding and you can still get the capital you need.And when it’s time to go for a series A, you’ll already have expanded beyond the borders of Austria and into other markets—more and more VCs will have noticed you.In my opinion, seeing the Austrian government free up so much funding specifically for entrepreneurs is the clearest indicator of progress to come. Despite the youth of the entrepreneurial scene here, more and more students and workers will decide to make the leap when they know they can get financial backing.So, what is the advantage of starting a business in Vienna? Over the past few years, it’s gone from a startup village to an early-stage empire, the ideal platform to really get started and grow from the actual epicenter of Europe. Once you have established yourself comfortably with the couple hundred million euros accessible here, every other European market is your friendly neighbor.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chatbot-3589528_1280-377x220.jpg","December 15, 2017","en",0.991135954856873,9.35574353206903e-05,0.469940900802612,0.000431038643000647,0.529534518718719

Of course we had to go. But the way – if you aren’t 100% sure what Lean Startup means, feel free to read my previous blog post where I point out it’s core principles.Here are our key learnings from the conference: Metrics in InnovationYes, every business needs metrics to validate whether an initiative is following the right path. But: businesses need to define their own Innovation Metrics without limiting themselves from going beyond measuring. There is no one-fits-all solution. If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you’ll be amazed by the results.– General George S. PattonThe “north star metric” is a key metric that is directly aligned to the value that a company creates for a client. It ensures that the team chooses the right path. If you give people a mission instead of detailed plans, expect better outcomes.Becoming a leader in InnovationLeadership in Innovation needs to be trained. This enables organizations to make the shift from product-centered organizations to human-centered organizations – in which both customer and employee are valued above all else.Want to know more about this? Check out this amazing book.Culture in InnovationEntrepreneurial cultures:Can be fostered through the ways we daily interact within an organizationAre built when everyone understands the product vision. Can everyone answer the question “where are we building towards”?Depend on being able to empathize with the employees – what matters to them?Need constant feedback loopsAre built when expectations and priorities are communicated clearlyNeed adoptable peoplemake teams love solving the problem rather than building the productFailure in InnovationBusinesses need to be brave and embrace failure to achieve future success.Think of ants.An ant population always sends 5% of their population to the “edges” – to some other place where they could find new food sources. The rest of the population works on their core and takes care of day-to-day business.Ants invest in trial and error. And so should you. Best by making use of Lean Startup methodology.

"https://theventury.com/blog/lean-startup/","TheVentury","Lean Startup Explained","On the 12th of February the “Lean Startup Summit” took place in Berlin.Since I am a huge fan of the Lean methodology, I knew I had to attend this conference. With big expectations I went to two-day summit and joined like-minded people in Berlin. People who are eager to exchange thoughts and learn about different takes on entrepreneurship within large corporations but also tiny startups.I’ll spare you the wait: I wasn’t disappointed.But let’s start at the very beginning and go into the basics of the Lean Startup approach before we dive into deeper context. In the following blog I will be explaining what Lean Startup means and why this approach is so valuable.Lean Startup: Innovation is “hit or miss”, isn’t it?Whether you are launching a tech-startup, work as a corporate innovator or are trying to contribute to your local community by providing a small business based on demand – it always feels like a “hit or miss” position. You build your business plan, and either it works out or it doesn’t – correct?Wrong.It’s a common misconception that building an extensive business plan is the perfect way to go. Can making assumptions and building hypotheses based on unknown factors and variables before experiencing it first hand really be viable?As a matter of fact, creating a static business plan takes a lot of time. It is often being written by an individual under exclusion of the public (e.g. potential customers / stakeholders) and includes a 5-year forecast for costs, profits and potential margins that make oracles seem like phonies. Rationally speaking, it is not a big surprise that this approach has a low success-rate. This approach of working on extensive research behind closed doors without any real-world validation will most likely result in a plan based on fiction. Nevertheless, large companies and start-ups often work straight by this book. They stick to this principle in order to convince investors and potential partners with their ideas.But what is the alternative?One that seems promising is called “Lean Startup”, that – contrary to the name – can help startups AND corporates with their initiatives by following these three key principles, according to Steve Blank:Generate your HypothesesRather than investing time and money in months of planning, founders should summarize their hypotheses in a framework called “Business Model Canvas”.The “Business Model Canvas” basically describes how a company/project/business model creates value for the potential customers and itself.Collect FeedbackLean Startup uses the approach of “Customer Development”. That means validating the defined hypotheses in “field interviews” (yes, people go out and actually talk to their potential target groups to collect feedback). In these interviews potential customers and target groups are asked about their opinions and pains, going through all elements of the “Business Model Canvas” to revise assumptions and generate essential learnings. Develop your first sketchThe method of Lean Startup utilizes “agile development”. This term is probably well-known to all the IT Developers among the readers. Unlike typical IT Project release cycles, you focus on iterative development based on short feedback cycles to ensure alignment with customers’ benefit. This is usually the moment when startups and corporate innovation teams test their hypotheses based on a very first version of the product, called MVP. The lean approach is centered around the customers and their ever changing needs – thus making you agile and more resisting to failing. And personally, I think that that’s exactly what you need.Now, that you have an overview over the basics of a Lean Startup – what it means, where it is applicable and what the basic methods are, let us dive deeper into the topic!Make sure to check out my post with my key learnings & insights from the Lean Startup Summit 2019 in Berlin.Get in touch to find out how the LEAN approach can benefit your company.

How many hours do you spend each week doing repetitive tasks? Probably enough – but digitization has reached the point where marketing automation will free you from this burden.What is Marketing Automation?Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one of 2020’s hottest business topics: in fact, the industry’s turnover shot from US $100mn in turnover by 2012 to an expected US $5bn this year, according to Statista.com. Of course, this revolution doesn’t stop at the domains of marketing. In this short blog post, we will show you 3 simple automations digital and growth marketing managers can implement right away – without knowing how to code at all. This will not only help you save some of your valuable time, but also – if done well – to increase your marketing’s reach many-fold at no additional cost.1. ZapierUse Zapier for Process Automation – No coding skills required Recently, Robotic Process Automation has become increasingly viable for smaller businesses and startups. While most RPA software is in effect only affordable for larger corporations, Zapier is different: with it’s free version or prices starting at € 19.90 per month, it is the natural choice of most SMEs and startups.Zapier works by simply connecting numerous services and enabling them to interact with their corresponding APIs. For example:A lead fills out a Google Form on your Website: this triggers the Workflow within ZapierZapier takes the information from Google Forms, and sends it to an Excel sheet prepared by you, including a whole set of complex calculations.Zapier updates your customer database and CRM tools.A new task is created automatically in your project management tool, for example Jira or Asana.Your team receives a notification, including your Excel model’s results and a link to your CRM entry via email, Slack, or whatever channel you prefer.As Zapier supports more than 2.000 different applications from ActiveCampaign to Zendesk, this creates a myriad of possibilities – not only for marketing automation, but just about anything. Plus: if you know Python, add your own code, and create even more complex workflows.2. The LinkedIn HelperA tool for LinkedIn B2B Marketing Automation LinkedIn Helper enables you to increase your reach on LinkedIn to personal profiles, for instance by automatically sending requests and messages, or inviting your contacts to like your page. Hence, this is a Tool primarily to be used by your sales staff. To begin with, simply download the tool from https://linkedhelper.com/download – the subscription starts at €8 per month.I have put together a quick step-by-step guide for you. Follow these steps after the installation was done:Open your LinkedIn profile. On the right bottom corner open the LinkedIn Helper, and select “Collect, Select & Invite 2nd & 3rd party contacts”.Create a new list of people to reach out to. Go back to LinkedIn’s search page, set your search filter by entering keywords or companies plus the relevant location.On the LinkedIn Helper, click “Collect contacts for inviting”. Your new list will populate now automatically, which takes a while – don’t close the window. When its done, you can go through your invitation list, and exclude specific people manually.When your list is ready, switch to LinkedIn Helper’s message tab to enter your message – you can even personalize it by entering the variables of people’s names, positions and companies.LinkedIn doesn’t really like bots like this one (though it is legal to use them). Therefore, you can reconfigure LinkedIn Helper’s regular timeouts, which models human behavior, and makes the bot impossible to be detected. Here, you can also increase the invitation speed up to 100 invites per day.Hit “Start profiles inviting” – and there you go! You have to keep the tab selected and open, but can open additional new windows to keep working in while LinkedIn Helper does its job.After sending your invitations, you can also export your invitee list as a .csv file. For more detailed information, you can check out this tutorial.3. ScrappyWeb Crawling and Web Scraping: A special tip for Startups with Platform Business Models A final tip especially for startups building platform business models: As you are facing the hen-and-egg dilemma when simultaneously building demand, while there is not even enough supply on your platform yet, try to emulate the supply right away. Your solution to do so? Web Scraping!Imagine you build a platform to book holidays on farms (very Austrian, I know), but you don’t get any farms to sign up because you don’t have sufficient users. And your users don’t like your platform – because there are not enough farms around. Then save yourself half the hassle and solve one side of your equation by crawling the web for farms offering rooms to rent. Scrape the information and put it onto your platform too. The farms won’t be mad about their additional coverage, and you will offer plenty of options to your users.A great open-source and free-to-use tool for web crawling is Scrapy. Or simply use Python’s Beautiful Soup library as a web scraping tool pulling out website data, using the pages’ document object model (DOM). Your developer (or one of ours) will be happy to set it up.What next?Pretty neat what automation can do for you, right? Now that you have a brief overview, its probably time to dig deeper into your favorites with some tutorials. In case you would like us to support you with automating some of your tasks for you, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

"https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-botplan/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Botplan","Last month was the kick-off of our 2nd Batch of ELEVATE – Europe’s first Bot Accelerator. We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.Starting off today is Botplan from San Mateo, USA. Botplan’s chatbot converts online traffic into leads for real estate agents and brokers by instantly providing answers to customer’s questions online. We asked Jatinder Singh, Botplan co-founder & newly discovered Käsekrainer & Glühwein addict a couple of questionsWhen and how was your first experience with a bot?My first chatbot experience was on NewsBytes chatbot on Facebook Messenger.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Yes – Botplan’s Chatbot for Real Estate ?. The best in the business.Why should someone use your solution / What is the problem you are solving?Real estate agents spend on average $400 a month driving traffic to their websites. However, they are not able to convert that traffic into leads, simply because their websites lack a live engagement tool. A real estate lead in the US is worth $4000 on average. Our tool costs only $9.95 per channel per month. Even if our tool only provides one incremental leads a month, it will offer an RoI of 40,000%What’s your bot‘s superpower?At the core, our bot is a Lead Capture bot; we have designed it to be very respectful in capturing lead information. E,g., it seeks customer’s permission on their preferred way to be contacted. It also allows customer to talk about their availability for an appointment using natural language like “any time tomorrow after 2 pm”. It works like an experienced receptionist that can work with very little inputs from the customer and make appropriate decisions.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a bot?My advice is to start building a bot using off the shelf solutions to evaluate whether your bot solves a real problem. Once you get feedback from actual users, then start thinking about what tech stack will really help you build a bot that serve the needs of those actual users. This early feedback from the market is essential in making sure that the time and resources spent on building the comprehensive chatbot are well spent.Since you are based in the US and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.I have always wanted to visit Vienna, and I was super lucky to come to Vienna just when the Christmas season started. I really enjoyed the Christmas markets around town and especially the one at City Hall. The Gluhwine is not to be missed at the Christmas markets. Vienna has great food and cafes, which are fairly affordable. Overall, I loved my first trip to Vienna and I am looking forward to go back for future meet ups.What was the weirdest thing you got to know/do in Austria?Drink beers while I am walking the street ?Your last words to the community (for now)?The team at ELEVATE is experienced, smart, kind, and friendly. They are not only helping us with our chatbot, but also made introductions to local Angel funds within my first week of joining ELEVATE. I am very happy to have joined ELEVATE and excited about future possibilities.We can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you, Team Botplan!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Online-Marketing-1-377x220.jpeg","December 20, 2017","en",0.997010409832001,0.000168983111507259,0.4634008705616,0.000613954500295222,0.535816133022308

We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.This week, get to know Growthbotics, a chatbot that solves the difficulty of Google Analytics by simpliying and analyzing critical data for B2B industries such as digital marketing agency and Ecommerce.Wilson Kao, co-founder of Growthbotics from Taipeh, told us about his first experience with a bot and gave his insights in building a chatbot. But read for yourself: When and how was your first experience with a bot?My first experience was when I had some issues with login registration for Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange platform, I had to contact their help support which was initially filtered by their customer support chatbot.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Woebot, it is a AI NLP (Artificial Intelligence Natural Language Processing) chatbot for mental health patients who prefer talking to robots and in return, the robots provide Cognitive Behavioral Therapy by engaging in conversations.Why should someone use your solution / What is the problem you are solving?Anyone who uses Google Analytics and needs knowledge about their website performance can use our chatbot. We are solving the inconvenience, complexity and analytical limitation of GA.What’s your bot‘s superpower?AI NLP and Predictive Analysis algorithm. You don’t need to hire a data scientist to predict your business traffic and find business insights, a chatbot can do it for you with substantially lower costs.Why did you choose Elevate?It’s the best bot accelerator in the world. I was in another accelerator before and I must add that the people behind ELEVATE are very friendly folks.What are your expectations for the program?To find product/market fit and scale enough for VC funding.Since you are based in Taiwan and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.We imagined it to be a romantic city and it turned out to be very romantic indeed. It’s definitely not the same as Germany!What was the weirdest thing you got to know/do in Austria?Public toilets are not free! We are excited to have you in Vienna, Team Growthbotics!

"https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-iconic/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Iconic","Our next team has travelled far to take part at Elevate – Sandesh and Vishakha from Team IconicBot fly in from India for our monthly meetups! Vishakha is a well-known actor and film producer and Sandesh is a former IBM’ler who is responsible for the tech at IconicBot. Please give us a short description of your chatbot: We bring fans and their icons together. We use Artificial Intelligence technology to help influencers reach their true fans effectively & in no time!Why should someone use your chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?Celebrities have many fans and it is impossible for them to talk to every single one in person. This is where IconicBot steps in – it bridges the gap between fans and icons. The celebrity chatbot allows daily engagement with each individual fan and the icons benefit from higher fan engagement and a way to monetize their inbox through potential brand partnerships.How did you guys meet?We met 3 years ago and founded two start-ups together, which are currently hibernated. Vishakha has almost 10 years of experience in the entertainment industry and I have more than 8 years of technical experience. We, as a team, perfectly complement each other and therefore decided to build a bot for the entertainment industry.Why did you choose Elevate?Elevate chose us. (laughs)We are from India, which is already a huge market, but we also thought of extending IconicBot to the European market. Therefore, it is a great experience to work with different teams who have a completely different culture. Elevate is the first program that accelerates bots and is situated in Europe – so that was a perfect fit!What are your expectations for the program?In the first step, we want to deploy the bot for two major celebrities and want to target big product houses in the music industry.When and how was your first experience with a chatbot?It was not really a chatbot – my first experience was with the AI assistant Siri. In India we have a completely different fluency when we talk, and I did not really like the experience of talking to Siri.Fans who would use our bot speak more than 18 other languages. We are therefore using NLP but sort of a bot-hybrid to create a unique user experience. With that we can assure that the user likes to chat with the bot and does not perceive it as being dumb.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?You should definitely come here! The people at TheVentury are really nice and they have amazing technological knowledge. There are so many coaches to guide you and tech applications they can provide you with to which is a great help to build your startup. And, Europe is just great!Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a chatbot?Every customer only has 15 apps and the app-installation numbers have decreased. People do not engage that much with apps anymore, so penetrating the user base with an app will be quite tough. Messengers are the next big thing! People use messenger more than social media. You have to build something where you meet the consumer – a bot is ideal for that!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8412_EAP_171123_TheVentury_Elevate-1-377x220.jpg","August 28, 2017","en",0.994665443897247,7.08618099451996e-05,0.869669020175934,0.000775923312176019,0.129484131932259

We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.Last but not least, get to know Janus, a b2b software that will act as your virtual IT-adminstrator. Barbara Haiden, co-founder of Janus from Vienna explains the Janus solution and tells us about her favorite chatbots today:Please give us a short description of your solution:Janus – our B2B software – is a virtual IT-Administrator. It can take over some of the administrator’s tasks as running, monitoring and repairing IT infrastructure (Linux based only at the moment). The chatbot is part of the software as it will be the user interface.Your definition of a chatbot?Our chatbot will be the user interface for working with our software Janus. As many of the (indirect) competitor’s interfaces are so complicated we want to make it as easy as possible and so we thought a conversational interface as a chatbot’s would be the best solution for it. Our customers can use English for communication and working with our software.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Yes, we do have more than one! For example the chatbot from our friends from the Vienna based start-up ONDEWO… Or HAL9000 from the movie 2001 a space odyssey <U+0001F642>Why should someone use your solution?The aim of our software Janus is to run, monitor and repair IT infrastructure on an autonomous basis so that the people normally dealing with that have more time for other tasks or projects.What’s your bot‘s superpower?Making the usage of our software as simple as it can be – with the help of our Janus bot.Why did you choose Elevate and what are your expectations?As we have experience in a wide range of fields (as software development, IT administration, marketing, statistics, etc.), deep knowledge in chat bot development is none of that. So we thought, that it might be a good idea to get help from some experts in this area and we applied for ELEVATE – to get better knowledge and hands-on development of our user interface/chatbot.We can’t wait to see you achieve great things, team Janus!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/STARTPLATZ-ELEVATE-scaled-377x220.jpg","January 18, 2018","en",0.995702922344208,9.52485133893788e-05,0.416493982076645,0.00054596527479589,0.582864761352539
"https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-jingle/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Jingle","New week. New team. Meet Team JingleGreg, Luke and Kevin are the founders of Jingle. Greg loves working on marketing and sales strategies and Luke is responsible for operations and management. Together with their ‘techie’ Kevin they make a great team which drives to excel and have fun at the same time. Please give us a short description of your Chabot: Jingle is a personal shopping assistant that helps you find local products in your proximity. Our service helps customers find specific products in their area, and furthermore include helpful information such as price and the availability in store. Thereby, we support customers as well as local retailers – we do not only find the concrete product but also bring customers back into local stores.Why should someone use your Chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?The particular problems we are facing can be split into a customer and retailer part. The customers on the one hand tackle the problem of not finding wanted products in their proximity and thereby often transitioning to online shops. Just think of the last time you wanted to buy something really fast. Did you know exactly which store to go to? Probably not, right?On the other hand, retailers try to get more customers into their physical shops but often fail at effective marketing – especially in the era of the internet. Our service solves the customer related problem by providing all the needed information at one place and thereby simultaneously solving the retailers’ problem by bringing customers back into local stores.How did you guys meet?Greg and Luke met at the university where they shared similar interests – especially entrepreneurship. Having formulated the business model over the course of last year, we decided that it was time to find the perfect technical addition to the team. After searching for quite some time, Kevin our new Co-Founder and CTO was recommended to us through our network. And we are super happy that he joined us on our path to promote local retailers.Why did you choose Elevate?After a lot of brainstorming, research and validation processes we decided to solely focus on a chatbot as we love the idea of a conversational interface – the ultimate interface. We heard about Elevate being THE go-to accelerator program specialized on building exactly that. The timing could not have been better for us and after the first initial meetings, we knew Elevate was the right fit! We are very happy and proud to be part of the bot family here.What are your expectations for the program?Together with the chatbot gurus from Elevate we want to finish developing our MVP until the end of the program while also diving further into the chatbot community. In the long run, of course, our goal is to create a bot that users love and use frequently!When and how was your first experience with a Chatbot?It was definitely NOT love at first sight. The chatbot hype in Vienna started about a year and a half ago. I was working for a start-up back then and religiously read the Buzzfeed news every evening.One particular night I saw a post about a well-known American news company that had just deployed a bot. The bot would send me tailored news every day and claimed to learn about my interests with time. I HAD to try it. Plot twist – I absolutely hated it. It was completely unclear to me how such a large company could release such nonsense, believing they where actually creating something valuable. So my first impression – not good.However, this experience lead to lots of research on NLP and AI technology. By the day my interest in chatbots started to grow up to the point where I got hooked and wanted to build my own.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?If you are a early stage start-up and you are looking forward to building a chatbot– Elevate is definitely the right program for you. It’s a great team, everyone is highly motivated, and it’s fun – exactly how it should be. Don’t hesitate to apply and find out yourself! Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a Chatbot?It should work. It should be easy to understand. And it should be fun – if you are going to build a chatbot without a character/personality, you are probably better off without a conversational interface.Want to know more about Team Jingle?

Find out more about them at our Demo Day – join the event in person @weXelerate or remotely through the livestream on May 23rd!This week, get to know Polaama, an automated end-to-end customer engagement solution for the tours & activities industry. Madhu Parthasarathy, co-founder of Polaama and Leberkäse-lover told us about his bot’s superpowers, his favorite chatbot and gave his insights in building a chatbot. But read for yourself: When and how was your first experience with a bot?The first time I heard an automated voice ask me questions over the phone (when talking to a customer service agent) would be my first experience.Do you have a favorite chatbot?I enjoy talking to the Mitsuku chatbot. I think she has personality and is able to hold her own on most conversations.Why should someone use your solution?Imagine that you are a leisure traveler making a trip to San Francisco. You have heard a lot about the Alcatraz island and would like to go. You have identified from Trip Advisor that “SFO Alcatraz tours” is the top tour operator that offers this service.If this business used Polaama to interact with its customers, you can simply open Facebook Messenger (or any of your favorite chat applications), ask any questions and receive answers immediately and purchase tickets with one click right from the chat window. You will then receive reminders about your activity, details about what you need to bring and get directions to the place. Better still, you can start a conversation on the business’ web page and then continue the conversation from your Facebook Messenger.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a bot?First understand what problem you are going to solve and if your target customers really think it’s a problem. Then determine if a bot is the right technology to solve the problem. Once you have determined this, go full steam ahead!Why did you choose Elevate?Elevate is the first bot accelerator that also offers a team who will work with you in a hands-on role. This has already proved to be very helpful for Polaama at such an early stage.What are your expectations for the program?Go to market with a product that truly benefits my target customers.Since you are based in the US and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.I have heard about Austria as a beautiful country (especially Vienna) and that proved to be true. It was cloudy most days but that did not take anything away from the city’s beauty. Another thing that stood out was the warmth and helpful nature of Austrians.

He, Kathi who is responsible for UX and marketing, and Scott, their mentor, make up Team Toni at the moment.Please give us a short description of your chatbot: Toni is a personal football buddy on Facebook Messenger. He gives you information on all the scores, the latest results, upcoming games and news on soccer. He can provide you with real-time information or round-ups of past games. With Toni.ai we are going to redefine fan engagement by creating virtual buddies that sports fans can engage with on the popular messaging platforms. This is not just limited to football.Why should someone use your chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?The thing about football information is, that it requires a lot of time to get all the information you want and often it is not personalized. With Toni we offer you your personal assistant that gives you the information you are searching for directly in the channel you already know and use – Facebook Messenger. You don’t need to install an App or log-in at a website. For leagues, clubs, and players we’ll provide a platform for increasing fan engagement and interact with fans on a personal level.How did you guys meet?The idea behind Toni arose last year for the European Football Championship 2016 where we built the first prototype. We already gained a lot of users and media coverage there. This was the beginning of the project, and now we are developing Toni further to be a general football chatbot and Toni.ai as a fan engagement platform for sports leagues, clubs, and athletes. This is also where the other teammates entered. I wanted to also include more of the business and UX side into Team Toni and therefore expanded the team.Why did you choose Elevate?Because it’s awesome! The guys are really motivated and we have the feeling that they can really support us and push Toni to a highly successful level! ELEVATE was the perfect fit for us. We had our first MVP and were thinking about how to market it and how we are going to build a business around it – and this is exactly where ELEVATE stepped in to support us.What are your expectations for the program?We really hope to have the big players of the soccer industry engaged in Toni – the big clubs or betting companies! And we want to give Toni a unique personality and attract as much users as possible!When and how was your first experience with a chatbot?My first experience was a news bot. It was very nice to get information, but it was not really personal. That’s something we want to do better with Toni – we really want to personalize the content. The user should feel welcome and see Toni as a friend.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?Do it! If you think about applying – just apply! Have fresh ideas, find a good team and then you will get support from TheVentury and it will give your product a push.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a chatbot?The chatbot scene is changing very fast. You can now create bots without needing any coding skills.

Yes, I’m hyped! Why, you wonder? Because I just came out of a session with 10 brilliant people from all over the world, who happened to still share the same level of excitement and enthusiasm as they did this February, when we kicked off Batch #5 of ELEVATE. Yes, I’m talking about the founders of the four startups we are currently working with.A group of people that give me, personally, immense joy and appreciation for what I get to do every day. But it’s not only me who loves the time we get to spend with the startups:Working with startups from our acceleration program ELEVATE is an integral part of what we do at TheVentury. Our accelerator for AI & Machine Learning startups helps us to keep up to date on the newest technologies and gives us a chance to pass on our experience in building hypotheses-driven companies. Plus, it’s so much fun, we wouldn’t want to miss it for the world – the crazy times included!Today, we’re happy to introduce our newest additions to the ELEVATE family to you. Our Batch #5 startups and the amazing people behind them. We’re proud to have picked a bunch of passionate, hard-working and all-around great people to be part of this year’s batch and cannot wait to introduce them to you. So, without further ado: meet our Batch #5 startups!MidibrainCountry: AustriaMichael Krautsieder, the genius behind Midibrain, and a musician himself, has made it his goal to make the process of creating and producing music easy and intuitive, without having to get into the depths of music theory.The first app of the Midibrain series, Chord Progression Generator, has been built already by Michael, who is not only a musician, but also a developer, and has 110K downloads so far. Currently, he is working on the second app in the Midibrain family – also a tool for music producers. You can find out more about that one at our Demo Day. <U+0001F609>Michael is not only one of the newest additions to the ELEVATE family, but also to our office, as he moved into the space two months ago as well. And we have to say, we really enjoy having you and your getting things done attitude around, Michael!Oh and also: he is looking for a CMO/Co-founder who is just as excited about music producing as he is and who will take over the business side of things. Interested? Find out more about it here.Midibrain with their ELEVATE tag teamAvasa AI Country: UKWho of you has ever struggled with the process of finding a new home? When Mayank, one of the founders of Avasa AI asked our team this question for the first time, every single person raised their hands. And that’s exactly what the fantastic people behind Avasa AI are helping with: the stress and hassle of apartment/house hunting.Over the past year, Avasa AI has supported hundreds of house-hunters with their hyper-personalized home search that focuses on the tenant’s needs. On this quest, they are now going another step: empowering HR departments to support their new graduate employees and expats in finding homes fast and easy. This ultimately improves employee productivity and mental well-being.The team behind Avasa AI knows what they are talking about – the idea was born out of Mayank’s frustration when he was first house hunting in London. A couple of months later, when he was thinking of the idea for Avasa AI, he called Octavian, one of the real estate agents from his home search days, the one who was most helpful, and asked him to start a company together. The team is complemented by Rajnish, who Mayank met on a flight 11 years ago and who does not only have 35+ years of experience in building tech products and businesses but is also an angel investor. A true experienced dream team, I would say!We love having them around, even if it is currently only through video calls. I would also like to add, that my heart warms up every time I see how Mayank is passing his experience as a founder on to the other startups in the Batch and getting collaboration going.Avasa AI with their ELEVATE tag teamDetectolabsCountry: RussiaThe team behind Detectolabs have developed a powerful image recognition software that helps retail and restaurants to understand their customers better and create personalized offers them, ultimately creating sales opportunities for them. A Google Analytics or Hotjar for offline retail, so to speak. With the same technology, they also help retailers manage their stocks, avoid empty shelves and thus cut losses in real-time.The cool thing about this solution is that it can make use of the existing cameras that are installed in stores already. And, we know what you’re thinking, of course it’s 100% GDPR compliant!Time to introduce the super smart people behind the product to you: Alex, who is on the forefront of anything business and customer interviews. Honestly, after all the interviews he has done with people in retail and hospitality, I don’t think there is anyone who has deeper insights into the industry than him. And then there is Ilya, the ambitious and clever tech partner in crime. Supported by Irina, a tough business developer and financial wizard, they are working hard every day to make Detectolabs bigger and better.Just as Avasa AI, we can’t have them around at the moment, due to the distance and the current situation. However, our weekly calls are always a highlight for us, seeing the progress they are making every single week and throwing a couple of jokes in every now and again – for example about my bad Russian. We are truly impressed how seriously the team is taking feedback and how they manage to strike a balance between taking advice and running with it but also thinking it through and deciding what makes sense for them. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for you!Detecto Labs with their ELEVATE tag teamRotable Country: AustriaRotable is working on a SAAS-solution for the HR & clinical rotation management in healthcare facilities. What does that mean, you ask? They are basically saving hospitals and their doctors and HR professionals a lot of time on the rotation scheduling of doctors in training.And when I mean a lot, I really mean a whole lot. Because hospital-groups spend up to 216 hours a week reworking their rotation scheduling in their excel files. Rotable’s SAAS-solution will do this automatically and thus free up doctors time to enable them to focus on the important things: their patients.Team rotable knows how much time, effort and brain power goes into rotation scheduling, because Lisa, one of the founders, has been the one to do exactly this across nine hospitals at the same time for years. So, she decided to change it with her dream team: Yannick, a mastermind when it comes to making things look great and David, the guy behind the algorithms.

"https://theventury.com/blog/mentoring-at-seedstars-world-summit/","TheVentury","Mentoring at Seedstars World Summit","For the last few days I was invited to the beautiful city of Lausanne, Switzerland and the EPFL campus for mentoring with a focus on SAAS, Chatbots and Conversational Interfaces at the Seedstars World Summit. I was not only amazed by the stunning views of lake Geneva and the still snowy mountain tops, but even more by the incredible passion and entrepreneurial spirit of all participants of the summit.Let me break down the participants:69 start-ups from emerging markets who left their regional competition behind came to Lausanne for a week to create connections to businesses, mentors and, most importantly, to each other.60+ mentors both from Switzerland and abroad (some were traveling from as far as Manila, Philippines!) supported these start-ups on their challenges and provide them with guidance96 members and volunteers of the Seedstars family helped to ”keep it swiss” (ensure everyone is on time) and make certain everyone had a great time.Day 1 – Hosting the SAAS business services mentoring sessionI was selected to host the session SAAS business services (especially bots and plugins) together with Stefan Ehrhardt from Google. We were given a tight schedule and a few topics to focus on for the five 75 minute sessions we had together with our very diverse set of 5 start-ups :SatisMeter – a customer satisfaction measurement tool from the Czech RepublicKiwix – an offline internet for people that are faced with no or bad internet connection or censorship from Swizerland/FranceWidebot – a bot builder platform and arabic NLP provider from EgyptVdoCipher – an end to end video hosting platform from IndiaEve.calls – a voice service that can handle outbound and inbound calls from the UkraineWhile it was a challenge for us to keep it relevant for all teams and making sure to spend equal amounts of time on the individual topics, the diversity also brought many different perspectives to the table. The unique ways in which these entrepreneurs are tackling the challenges of acquisition and activation, customer retention and growth not only gave the other start-ups good ideas, but also left me full of inspiration.After the day, Seedstars gathered all mentors to collect feedback which they received very well and already applied on the next day. The first day concluded with a delightful mentors dinner, where all the mentors had the chance to get to know each other and share experiences. I had the pleasure of making connections to many pioneers in their fields, such as Joseph de Leon, Steffen Kellner, Bracken Darrel, Vincent Tresno, Stefan Dobrev, Jon Attwell – and many others.Day2 – 1:1 mentoring sessions On the second day start-ups were able to select a mentor to talk about their businesses and obstacles in 1:1 meetings. Each start-up had 60 to 75 minutes to explain what they are tackling, gather feedback and enjoy a spirited discussion on what is coming next.The 4 start-ups I met with were:tootle – a 2wheeler based ride sharing solution from NepalSaipos – a cloud based POS system for the food industry in BrazilTunga – an AI and NLP provider from MongoliaPayit – peer to peer payment provider from Mexico.I was as much humbled for being chosen as a mentor, as I was impressed by hearing the different backstories of the founders and their ideas and experiencing the passion with which they are working hard to reach their goals, despite being faced with many obstacles. Interestingly enough, none of these start-ups where there to win the grand price on the summit day, but much rather to enhance their businesses through ideas, feedback and new connections.My takeaways:The solution often lies in asking the right questions. Most of the time you cannot provide an absolute solution to a challenge they might face. Instead, ask for “Which process can I use to tackle challenge X?”. This holds even more value when you are mentoring a start-up from a market you have basically no clue about.Strategy is nothing without cultural awareness and an understanding of your local customers.The way of entrepreneurship provides value everywhere.Chatbots and conversational interfaces are not just a phenomenon of the northern hemisphere. Great start-ups utilize them all over the world.From the organizers to the mentors and start-ups. All people I talked to, where incredibly open minded, receptive to feedback and appreciation.Start-ups in emerging markets focus much more on solving “real” problems and convenience often just automatically comes with it. The quality of the start-ups was high across the board and I am certain all of them have a chance to create a big impact.My gratitude goes out to Seedstars for inviting me and giving me the chance to pass on learnings and to share my experiences. And thus, after two days of countless impressions and intense conversations I hopefully provided useful guidance for a few start-ups on their journey to success. It was a pleasure to meet so many passionate entrepreneurs, who inspired and motivated me to contribute even more to the startup-community in Austria and all around the globe.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/espresso-labs-scaled-377x220.jpeg","April 13, 2018","en",0.988723039627075,0.000581837633944815,0.0540664098225534,0.000482403280329891,0.944869339466095
"https://theventury.com/blog/myaustrian-messenger-service/","TheVentury","How we built the Austrian Airlines Chatbot","The idea to the Austrian Airlines Chatbot was born right after the announcement of Facebook opening up their Messenger API. To us it was crystal clear from the beginning: this is going to be huge! And because we already realized a rather big innovation project with Austrian Airlines (see flymeto.austrian.com) we approached their social media agency ambuzzador to partner with us once again to bring this innovation to Austrian.Said and done. Austrian Airlines were very quick in realizing the huge potential and allowed us to start the project.What should we do? Where to start when building a Chatbot?There were some major decision to make in conceptualizing the Chatbot. First, there was the question which functionality we should provide. What is the scope of the bot? We quickly identified that a minimal viable bot (MVB) for an airline should:be able to search for flightsprovide excellent answers to the top 5 customer support questionsbe able to handle other questions reasonably welldo small talk on a basic levelKeep in mind that this was the MVB specification. It was clear from the start onwards, that we wouldn’t be able to handle 100% of the requests successfully. So we needed an additional option:If the bot fails, hand the conversation over to a human agent for further processingThis system differs entirely from the setup that KLM is currently believed to operate on, which is: Let an AI make a suggestion and a human sign off on the message. While it is obvious that their system (for now) is more precise – because a human is still in the loop – the future potential makes our approach more powerful. Only in a solution like this one can fully materialize the potential of an AI, but keep the human capacities for edge cases and complicated requests.Hello, who is speaking?Now that we knew what to speak about, the next question was: who is speaking?There are two main strategies here: a) You create an avatar, and let that avatar speak b) The brand speaks for itself Both have their advantages and disadvantages and I leave that to another discussion, but in the end we opted for B with Austrian Airlines: the myAustrian Messenger Service was born. Interesting side note: The decision was made not to use the word bot in the name, because Austrian Airlines users aren’t accustomed to this term yet.Ok great, but how do we speak?So now that we clarified what to speak about and who is speaking, we arrived at the question: How do we speak? Most companies have a set of rules for their Corporate Design – but now we are talking text. So you need a “non-visual branding guideline”, which, in most cases, exceeds the guidelines in a Corporate Design handbook. And that is exactly where our partner ambuzzador comes in. They provided the domain specific knowledge for Austrian Airlines, which includes standard greetings like “Servus” or certain ways to communicate. This domain knowledge is always an important part of the personality of the bot. Because only the personality makes the experience something unique and hopefully outstanding.MVC <U+2260> ChatbotAfter clarifying all the personality and soft parts, we finally had the go for the hard parts – building the chatbot. But soon we realized that we had a major problem: A classic MVC (Model View Controller) structure of software projects doesn’t work! What is your controller? – You only have 1 view (the Messenger API so to say). It was really hard for us to press the structure of a bot into this excellent model of building software. So at some point we gave up and did what every developer does: Rethink everything! What we came up with is, IMHO, a clever system to structure big bot architecture: a lifecycle model. Only in a lifecycle model I have the possibility to hand over messages from different packages to another to facilitate a structured processing of the input to the output. The Austrian Airlines Bot therefore has 4 lifecycle modules:EnhanceUnderstandKnowledgeDecideEnhanceIn this first model we aim to correct and “enhance” – duh – the user message. We convert payloads to objects, emojis to a readable format etc. This is also where you correct spelling and grammar mistakes, or add additional context information for the next module.UnderstandIn the “understand” module we try to understand the user intent and extract entities we are working with. This is mainly done by the NLP/AI service api.ai, which was recently aquired by Google. We decided to go with api.ai because back then, when we did our market analysis, they were the ones we felt most comfortable with concerning the quality of their modeling (though they are expensive). In addition to this external service we had to work around a couple of glitches and specialties of the platform to correct and further customize the results with our own little NLP engine. This was necessary since a general AI/NLP provider can’t handle all the cases we wanted. Here is also the point in the software where we try to generate a first answer to the user.KnowledgeIn this module we aim to improve the result from the previous section even further – either by finding better answers in the knowledge base of Austrian or by simply enhancing the output by e.g. quick replies that are fed from the long term memory. The latter is especially powerful since it drastically increases customer satisfaction and speed. In this module we work a lot with different IBM Watson APIs (which are extremely powerful, #fanboy). Here we also decide whether the content should be enhanced with a web view (e.g. a date picker in a web view) or not.DecideNow that we have finished the lifecycle, it is time to decide. This module now looks at the different answers that the previous modules produced and tries to decide what the best way to present the information in the messenger platform is. Is it a carousel?, An image? Just an emoji? Or is text just fine? What you see in your message window is the outcome of this decision.We failed – happens – how do we recover?As mentioned in the beginning, it was clear that the bot wouldn’t be able handle 100% of all use cases. So it was important to define an exit case that would hand over to the excellent support staff of Austrian Airlines. This in turn creates a few problems with the bot dynamic. Since the bot would automatically answer to every message, we had to “silence” it in these situations. This, and waking it up again, are some of the finer processes that are crucial to ensure a good customer experience overall. SUMMARYOverall, we were really happy with the results of this short 3-month innovation sprint with Austrian Airlines and are incredibly excited about what’s to come. We recognize that the bot performance we deliver at the moment is not yet were we want it to be – but that is how innovation and early prototyping works. We are constantly improving the setup and the confidence the system produces and are currently seeing more than 1.5k messages daily. Side Note: Vienna the City of ChatbotsOne amazing side note here: Vienna’s Bot Community. We are very proud to be located right at the center of bot activity in Europe. The City of Vienna was voted the most livable city in the world 8 consecutive times and now we are proud to say that we – as a community of bot developers, designers, writers and product owners – are the capital of bots in Europe too. Our monthly meetup is probably the biggest meetup in Europe and events like the ChatBotConf clearly establish our position. We (TheVentury) are excited to also launch Europe’s first chatbot centered accelerator in Vienna. We hope to further foster sustainable growth for this technology in Vienna, the City of Bots and are inviting everyone to apply to our first batch that starts Feb 2017.

There is no turning back the clock. Social media and search platforms are part of the world we live in and potential clients now expect to be able to find local agents online.Learn why a good online presence is vital to the success of local agents today.People Look OnlineThere is no way around it. People are looking online to find their answers. Whether they want to know about available homes in their area, down payment options or get an idea of the local agents in their area, people are using online search engines, Facebook groups and forums to get the information they need. Potential clients may look at popular real estate sites or use social media to get insights on a topic. Agents need to brand themselves and provide valuable information online in order to attract the segment of the population using mobile phones and tablets during their research process.Showcase ExpertiseOne reason to develop an online presence is to provide current and potential clients with information. It is not only about sharing the latest listings. Buyers, sellers and investors have a number of questions that an agent may help with to help them avoid a headache. Becoming an authority and sharing valuable resources and information can help an agent grow their following, develop stronger relationships and attract new clients. When information is valuable it is likely to be shared to a viewer’s circle, which in turn may increase an agent’s potential reach.Not only can agents provide information but previous clients and colleagues can offer referrals and feedback about an agent and their services. This can help viewers understand the type of experience they may be able to expect from an agent. Having this information available online can help an agent differentiate themselves from other local agents. The customer experience is key and word-of-mouth referrals and online reviews provide agents with a steady source of new clients.An Ever Changing WorldFacebook can be counted on to continually make changes. Search engines do too. Google algorithms are constantly updated to make it easier for those searching to find the information that they need. Therefore, agents need to stay aware and keep their website and pages user-friendly. This may mean removing old code and reworking a site to make it faster to upload on a mobile device.Content may need to be tweaked to format correctly on different types of platforms as each has its own optimal preferences. Long form content may be more suitable on a platform such as LinkedIn. Pinterest and Instagram are geared to sharing and commenting on images. Videos do well on Facebook. Agents would do well to perform a website audit and run through their website’s functionality on a regular basis to stay on top of any issues that may develop with the latest changes or through a hosting platform. In addition, continue to deliver a steady stream of content on social media platforms to maintain and grow engagement.Take Control of Your PresenceThe best way for agents to target and attract new clients is to develop a functional and professional website. A well-designed site works as a calling card and should have the following key features:Easy Navigation;Functionality across devices;An attractive and logical layout;Easy-to-read text; andHigh-quality images.Many agents choose to work with a professional web designer to create and maintain their site. The use of directories and social networking websites can help agents expand their network and attract both other professionals and potential clients. Continue to learn about developing an online presence and how to best make use out of a professional website and social media networks and never be at a loss for clients.

"https://theventury.com/blog/outsider-perspective/","TheVentury","From An Intern’s Eyes: From the Valley to Vienna","This summer, I made the switch from working in the startup ecosystem of Silicon Valley to working with TheVentury as a student intern here in Vienna. As weeks go by, see what similar trends I’ve been able to find here: Silicon Valley to Vienna My name is Sean Moakley, I am a 20-year-old student at Santa Clara University, and I come from Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Like many university students, I don’t really know as much as I pretend to, but I can tell you one thing is certain: I want to work with entrepreneurs. Despite working with two (and onto my third) startups and living in Silicon Valley, I still can’t begin to understand what that really means.One thing has become crystal in my eyes, however: Founders are far more than enthusiastic programmers. They are some of the most amazing people you will ever meet.Endless hours of stress, ideas, breakthroughs, mistakes, and pitches. Mostly fueled by Philz coffee. You’d do anything for your startup, and you treat it like your child, because it is. According to Forbes, nine out of ten startups fail, and in a place like Silicon Valley, it’s as cutthroat as it gets. Founders dedicate their nights, their weekends, their very lives and souls to their work to even have a chance to be in that 10%. Why? Why push yourself to such limits when there’s virtually no chance you are starting “the next Uber of” your idea?Because everyone, like me, wants to be involved. From angels and VCs to naive students such as myself, we all want a piece, and we are all involved in the ecosystem. Working in Redwood City, CA last summer exposed me to more than a hundred startups all working out of one fully furnished ecosystem. Don’t imagine an Erlich Bachman-esque “I own 10% of that but you can stay here” situation; rather, we gave the space, the connections, the coaching, and sometimes the money that our companies needed to succeed. It was one nice big happy family.Once you left the building though, we had serious competitors. Every co-working space, incubator, and accelerator were constantly hunting for the brightest and best ideas and founders out there. And just like a team giving its tenth pitch to its tenth VC board, we all wanted an edge. Just being able to say that a Paypal or a Lyft or a Flexport worked out of your desk space, that you helped them reach where they are now, that you saw potential and invested before everyone else… it all creates an immense amount of pride and hype.This past summer, even as a lowly intern, I got to help these innovators I had come to admire. The time I spent among these entrepreneurs who spoke about their ideas like they would about a newborn child or their significant other, helped me realize the nearly unfathomable amount of passion and drive they have. Some of the most incredible people in Silicon Valley have names you’ve never heard before. And I was able to help connect startups with the mentors, investors, and corporate partners that they need to mold their idea into something great. It’s the ecosystem that developed stars of yesterday and today and is developing the stars of tomorrow–the picture of Silicon Valley.Yet it’s not just Silicon Valley, hallowed as it may be. People like this are all over the world.The end of the Summer came quickly, and soon enough I was on my way to Vienna, Austria for five months. World travel is another passion of mine; I’ve spent time volunteering in Central America, exploring in Italy, and studying in Australia, to name a few of my favorite experiences. While I’ll spend plenty of time traveling and exposing myself to new cultures, I want to be immersed in the startup culture here more than anything.And so I find myself interning here with TheVentury, eager to find that passion, desire, and drive in a new environment. A host of questions immediately come to my mind: What innovation is there to find in this cultural melting pot of a city, the most dense and diverse in an unbelievably stunning and mountainous country? What is all the rage in Vienna? Does Fintech, VR/AR, Sustainability, Chatbot, or AI receive the majority of funding? How profitable is a “successful” startup here? Exactly how much venture funding is there to be found in Vienna? I’ve got homework to do.Over the next few weeks I’ll gather every bit of information I can about the startup ecosystem here in Austria. As Vienna is truly in the center of Europe, it’ll be interesting to learn how it functions as a melting pot of ideas. While the entrepreneurial environment here is certainly far smaller than in Berlin or London, I can also guarantee that this charming “town” of almost 2 million people has more than just a rich history: It has the right aspirations to help create the next big thing.","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chatbots-377x220.jpg","November 28, 2017","en",0.993908703327179,0.0022552936898137,0.506398394703865,0.0118588507175446,0.47948744893074

Find out how exactly!FedEx Day at TheVenturyLast week we made it happen we changed our whole office with the help of a FedEx day and the manpower of the whole TheVentury team. FedEx stands for “Build and ship it in one day!” You have 24 hours to originate, develop, and deliver new products, new services, or a business process improvement. How? With a lot of energy, motivation, and pizza & beer.First step: The idea wallAs every innovative process is all about post it walls, every worker in the company, from intern to CEO, had the opportunity to come up with ideas and pin them. The great thing about these colourful walls is that you can easily cluster the ideas into different topics.What we wanted to change:rearrange tables the kitchen the meeting rooms the walls plants And of course, a sport and chill areaThe day we were all waiting forWe gathered around the office at 1:30 pm and started with taking a tour of inspiration. We went to have a look at the amazing mySugr office in the first district to get inspired. It was an awesome tour and experience. We then went back to the office where we were told how exactly we would pimp our office! Everyone had to choose one topic of interest which then formed a team. The result were mixed groups with people from different departments.After a short brainstorming session, the groups presented their ideas, received feedback and a budget of 500€. Luckily no one had the idea to spend it all on an ice cream machine (sorry guys, too late now).Let the fun begin!With a lot of enthusiasm and creative skills we pimped the office to match our companies core values. Which of course means the day ended with a night full of throwback music, free pizza and beers! Let us have a look at how we incorporated this initiative with our core values: EPIC!1. Entrepreneurial ThinkingEmbracing change is a key approach of TheVentury and this is why we decided to rearrange the space completely. Activity based working concept here we come! To make the offices more efficient, but also (and more importantly) inspiring, creative and innovative, we implemented our own version of David Dewane’s Eudaimonia Machine concept.We divided the space into different areas, allowing every employee to switch their work place setting according to his or her current needs. Some tasks are done better when you can work in a quiet corner, a creative brainstorming however would be more effective when done in a collaboration area and if someone needs to let off some steam, going to the “gym” and kicking the new punching bag might be the right call.2. PassionTo visualize how TheVentury drives innovation and progress we dedicated a wall to the team, showing a memory lane of events and achievements the company made over the last years. Another wall is devoted to our beloved clients with whom we share our enthusiasm and motivation. Now, they immediately see the purpose, intention and identity of TheVentury.3. ImpactWe love to create positive impact for the world but also for our team!Our workspace is like our home. We spend a significant amount of time of our lives in our office. This is why we had a whole team focusing only on plants. With the help of our new friends we are able to change the air quality in the office space. Did you know that plants have proved to alleviate stress? Taking care of the plants in between breaks can help you to deal with work-related stress. The presence of plants can reduce anxiety and even staring at plants can significantly reduce stress. As plants can uplift moods, employees are happier.4. Cooperation & EmpowermentLast but not least to visualize that our values are all about cooperation, we colored the hands of all the employees and let them form the letters E.P.I.C. on one of our office walls. One for all, all for one!To sum it up, our “pimp the office” idea worked out well because the employees were put in charge and were given full control over their areas. The team did not only meet the expectations but truly exceeded them.

Even though, Customer Development & Lean Startup are not new concepts when it comes to launching a new product, we still see people making the same mistakes over and over again. Let’s have a look at the most common pitfalls, so you can prevent to tap into them: Mistake #1: Not testing your assumptionsSpending too much time on writing a business plan but not enough on testing the most critical assumptions.While business plans may nudge you to think about certain extremely crucial things, they can also create the false premise that it is a plan that can simply be executed and lead to success. As Steve Blank, the “father” of Customer Development said: no business plan survives the first contact with customers. He does not argue against business plans per se, but as long as you do not have a proven business model, there is no point in making a 5-year plan.It is more crucial to find a strategy to test and validate the most critical assumptions that underlie the new business idea. Testing ideas and failing quickly is much better than spending an immense amount of time and resources on a product that nobody wants. That’s why we recommend our customers to go through a customer discovery process, before jumping into the development of the product and way before launching a new product. Three steps to get started with customer discovery:Use the Value Proposition Canvas and the Lean Canvas (or the Business Model Canvas) to put your idea on paperNote down & prioritise the underlying assumptions of your ideaCreate a solid plan to validate the assumptions with experiments Mistake #2: Not talking to (potential) customersTo this day, we see a lot of people brainstorming and designing their product in a silo. This behaviour is based on the premise that we have a clear understanding of what our customers want and need. The reality is: there are no facts inside the building. If you haven’t talked to your customers, you probably don’t really understand their problems to the full extend yet. This is especially true when launching a new product, but even if you want to develop an internal tool, talking to your users will help you gain a much better understanding of their needs.Many people forget that they can actually talk to customers even if they don’t have a product yet. Using the right techniques, you can learn about their most important problems and start validating your idea. We have yet to find a person who didn’t think it was worth talking to customers after doing so. Sometimes people are amazed by how many valuable insights they are able to get just by having conversations. Three tips for good customer interviewsPrepare a guideline of questions before jumping into the interviewsDon’t pitch your idea, learn about your customers’ lives and problemsAsk about specific events that happened in their life, instead of opinions Mistake #3: Overblowing the initial productThe third mistake usually happens after the first steps of validating the idea. After talking to customers, you start sketching out countless features of the product in your head, all of which will make up the perfect solution for their problem. The more time you spend thinking about it, the more ideas you have, and soon enough you have planned out a full-blown product that is ready to be implemented, missing the fact that it is still not proven that the product will actually take off and be accepted by your customers.Let’s take a step back and take a look at the definition of a minimum viable product (MVP). Eric Ries defines the MVP as “that version of a product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least effort”. Keeping this definition in mind, there are a lot of things that can be done to gather insights before jumping into development at all, but even when you are ready to launch an end-to-end MVP, it is important to carefully think about what assumptions should be tested first and how to deliver value to your customer. Three essential tips for scoping your initial productUnderstand your customers well enough to understand which feature will offer the most value to themScope your minimum viable product with the assumptions of your business model in mind and think about what you are trying to learnLaunch with few features only, start analysing results and only add more features subsequently So sum it up, avoid making these mistakes!If you are planning to launch a new product, prepare yourself to not make these most common mistakes. Think about your business model and become aware of the underlying assumptions. Talk to your customers before actually developing the product to start learning early in the process. When you are ready to build a minimum viable product, don’t blow up the scope, instead, build a product that allows you to validate your value hypothesis as fast as possible and iterate from there.If you need any support in this phase of your innovation journey, don’t hesitate to reach out to us!

"https://theventury.com/blog/real-estate-chatbot/","TheVentury","What is a Real Estate Chatbot?","What can a chatbot help with in the real estate industry? Time to ask the person who knows best: Jatinder Singh, CEO of Botplan.io. Botplan is one of our startups currently participating in ELEVATE Batch #2 and develops chatbots for the real estate industry. What for exactly and why it is different from other chatbots, he explains it all. CONVERSATIONS:The central goal of a Chatbot is to have conversations with human beings in natural language. While human beings can have conversations with each other on limitless topics, Chatbots, on the other hand, can engage in only a narrow set of topics. Although Chatbots cannot address unlimited topics, they do offer other benefits over human beings such as 24×7 availability, concurrent conversations with hundreds of customers without any delay, and the high speed and accuracy in which information can be shared with customers. The biggest advantage of a chatbot is that it allows businesses to build a relationships with potential customers through a casual conversation.PLATFORMS:Chatbots work on various messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Kik, Telegram, and Slack. Chatbots also work on SMS and on customized Web chat widgets. Why is it relevant for chatbots to be available on these channels? Because that is where your customers are. 91% of online time spent is on Messenger services. Top 4 messenger services have now taken over the top 4 social platforms in terms of customer engagement. Another important element of chatbots is that unlike mobile apps, customers do not need to download a chatbot to engage with it. Customers simply look up a chatbot, in the same way they would look up a friend on a messenger service, and start messaging or texting. This aspect allows Chatbot to be accessible by millions of customers instantaneously.DOMAIN:As mentioned during the Conversations topic; chatbots can engage in a limited number of topics. A chatbot must be “schooled” on a specific set of topics. A chatbot schooled on various Real Estate topics becomes a Real Estate Chatbot. A Real Estate Chatbot would understand that a Rambler, Townhome, or Condo is a type of residential building. It would also understand what a customer wants to accomplish when they say “schedule a showing” or “I need mortgage pre approval.” This domain knowledge allows the Real Estate Chatbot to provide relevant information back to the customer and take actions in accordance with customer needs.USE CASES:The big “so what” of the Real Estate Chatbot technology is what it can allow the Real Estate Agents to accomplish. It can handle a variety of tasks that allows the Real Estate Agent to spend more of their time closing homes and building a network in their communities, while delegating “busy work” to the Real Estate Chatbot. Chatbots can be especially productive in helping sort out leads that are ready to move forward compared to those that are just curious. Here are a few examples of what a Real Estate Chatbot could accomplish:Understand a customer’s needs – looking to buy or sellAnswer customer generic questions regarding selling or buying a homeCapture customer contact information and send the lead to the CRM systemSet up showings for interested buyersSchedule meetings between Agent and a new buyer or sellerOffer services such as mortgage pre-approvalsConnect Facebook Ads to Facebook Chatbot to drive engagement and generate leads Conclusion:Real Estate Chatbots leverage state of the art technology that allows them to engage customers in a conversation on a platform of customer’s choice. Their speed, scalability, and 24×7 availability makes Chatbots an ideal tool for customer engagement. As a Virtual Receptionist, Chatbots can answer customer questions and convert those conversations into leads for the Real Estate Agent.To learn more about Botplan’s Real Estate Chatbot, please contact them at info@botplan.io.

"https://theventury.com/blog/startplatz-elevate/","TheVentury","New partnership between STARTPLATZ & ELEVATE","Partnerships & collaborations are two of our core values here at TheVentury. This is why we are proud to announce our newest partnership with the STARTPLATZ Accelerator, a program supporting entrepreneurship in Germany’s Rhineland. Together with STARTPLATZ we are striving to boost local and international entrepreneurship, support our startups with an even stronger network and endless possibilities. To learn a bit more about STARTPLATZ, their experiences and know-how, we talked to Carolin Gattermann from the STARTPLATZ team.Carolin, the STARTPLATZ accelerator is starting its 15th Batch soon and is represented in two locations, Cologne and Düsseldorf. That’s quite a lot of experience you’ve accumulated over time and lots of startups and ideas you’ve seen. What are your key learnings from these past years?1) Founding is not for everyone. There are quite a few founders who underestimate the amount of time, passion and endurance you need for building a successful startup of just an idea. It’s not all coffee and table football, it’s (also <U+0001F609> ) very hard work!2) It is extremely hard to find founding in a very early stage, the phase where you work on idea validation and a proper problem solution fit. Business Angels or VCs normally start investing when there’s positive feedback from the market, which, as we observed during these last 14 batches, most likely happens after six to nine months. Our program helps bridging that gap and getting to that market fit earlier and better prepared.3) The right team is one of the most important factors for success, oftentimes more important than the idea itself. Try to gather an interdisciplinary team with different competences so that you can cover most of the tasks in the beginning internally (coding, strategy, sales,…).Since you’ve seen it all – or at least a lot: what was the craziest idea you’ve seen succeed?trackle is probably one of those. It is a temperature sensor (wearable) and App for family planning. The trackle sensor is worn in the vagina. It measures the body core temperature continuously overnight and sends the data to the App. In the meantime, they appeared on TV, won the Rheinland-Pitch and started a cooperation with Microsoft.What are you looking for in startups?We are searching for ambitious entrepreneurs, who love their product and intention, which is growing fast and who want to develop a sustainable business model. What we are searching in detail: Early-Stage Startups, Scalable Business Models and Technological Leadership.How do you support participating startups? What can applicants expect?STARTPLATZ accelerator teams will receive services worth 50.000 Euros which include a fix desk in our coworking spaces in Cologne or Düsseldorf, coaching and mentoring, workshops i.e. for Business Model Canvas, Lean Startup training, agile product development, Online Marketing etc., PR & Marketing support, access to the biggest startup and digital network in North-Rhine-Westphalia as well as internationally through the participation at GAN, and much, much more.What’s the most important piece of advice you would give to a founder?Go lean: Test, experiment, get feedback from as many and diverse people you can possibly talk to – and then don’t be afraid to pivot if the feedback you’ll receive is not as fantastic as you hoped. Only then you will be able to build a product your target group will love. And secondly: Hang in there! <U+0001F642>As always, the final word goes to our guest:Don’t be shy, just apply <U+0001F609>You can find all information about the program and the application on accelerator.startplatz.deWe cannot wait to see what the future brings and are excited for a fruitful partnership with many shared success stories!

"https://theventury.com/blog/startup-trends/","TheVentury","Exploring Trends in Austria’s Startup Ecosystem","The Second post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.The best insight into any market today will be the trends driving it. For startups, it’s all about seeing how smaller niche trends interact in the larger realm of a service- and technology-based economy. What trends are hiding in the Vienna ecosystem? I’ve always found it interesting how trends come and go, at least the ones in my short life. When I was little, everyone moved from their CD players to iPods—I still remember the first time I saw an iPod commercial. Then there was AIM, and even kids like me started getting cell phones. Later, with the continued explosion of social media, I was able to watch from the screen of my iPhone as Vine was born, lived its glorious life, and died quietly.At least that’s how I saw it grow, from when I was a little kid with some technology to now, when I’m a slightly bigger kid with more technology.The trends here in Vienna—even the smallest ones—will provide the clearest window for me to look through. Where were startups in Vienna five years ago, and where are they going now? Top news on Silicon Valley trends will range from what Elon Musk is doing with his sustainable self-driving cars this hour relative to last, which AI is going to revolutionize AI, who the newest YouTube star is, or what the latest VR gadget is.VC firms will devote most of their research and resources to certain trends, working to catch them before they get too big. I figure if I can track what the “big dogs” are themselves tracking here, I’ll be able to better understand the up and coming local trends.Lucky for me, the venture capital space in Vienna is bigger than ever. I’ll have plenty of resources and examples to follow to really see what’s a hit behind the scenes at the moment. To get a really good grip on what they’re doing, I’ll have to reach out and speak with them myself.For now, I’ll have a look at how the numbers are moving for each startup—who’s getting involved, and why?Initial research shows a lot of similar characteristics to the startup world that I have been exposed to. The 2016 European Startup Monitor reveals that Austrian founders average 30.8 years old, 67.8% are Austrian citizens, and the initial company consists of 2.34 workers. The age range is similar, as most founders in Silicon Valley are between 22-30 years old, while around a quarter are in their thirties and forties.So there were a lot of numbers I just threw right in your face. What do they all mean?Perhaps in Vienna many prefer to gain more experience before devoting themselves wholly to the idea they came up with in their mom’s garage. At conception, a startup will typically be less than five employees, so no surprises here that the number may be a little bit smaller. There are simply fewer working resources available in a city with roughly 2 million inhabitants compared to almost 8 million in the Bay Area. This does not mean they are the same (surprise!). It means they are similar.AustrianStartups Stammtisch – a monthly event where the startup scene in Austria gathers (Photo courtesy of AustrianStartups)However, the best experience you can have in the startup world is working for more startups. Failure, despite the pain, teaches so much. Most startups fail, but your second time around, you know a lot about what’s coming. How many entrepreneurs in Vienna have done it before and want to do it again?It seems that many do. The most telling statistic in my eyes is this: More than 40% of founders in the area had already started one other company in the past, and 17% had started more than one. Further, when Vienna-based founders were asked what they would do if they failed, six out of every ten claimed they would start another company while a further two would at least work as employees of other startups.Yes, that is underlined, bolded, and italicized.This is common all over the world, it seems. Because despite the sleepless nights and years of dedication often resulting in failure, their drive is such that it won’t let them quit until they succeed. To some, it’s called second startup syndrome. It’s like every founder is Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali with a laptop rather than a ball or gloves. Their ideas are their addiction.These are the right footsteps, following closely behind those of the big guys across the ocean.What about other trends? Small numerical movements only scratch the surface. Who are the founders, and where do they usually come from? How often are they funded? And what advantages do they seek in the Austrian market? That and more coming next.

"https://theventury.com/blog/success-stories-batch-1/","TheVentury","Accelerator Success Stories Batch #1","Last week, we had our 4 ELEVATE chatbot teams pitch in front of 100+ VCs and business angels as part of our accelerator program. Why? Because we believe in the team members, their concept and their business spirit. As proud (bot) parents usually do, we also want to show off our kids. That’s why we decided to share the success stories of our 4 amazing teams with you. They started off with a prototype – after 6 months, things look a bit different: Toni The idea behind Toni arose last year for the European Football Championship 2016 when Klemens built the first prototype. During ELEVATE, the team decided to expand the business model to Toni.ai – a platform for white-label sports chatbots. This also caught the attention of LAOLA1.at – Austria’s biggest sports portal. After some meetings, Toni.ai was able to happily announce their new partnership! Toni.ai now powers the new LAOLA1.at chatbot, which has an impressive 30% retention rate after two weeks, with the average user opening ten articles per day. Toni.ai was further able to attract LAOLA1.at and Sportradar as content partner, therewith gaining access to massive amounts of highly relevant sports data. After successfully launching their proof of concept, they are eager to work with sports clubs as B2B customers. IconicBot IconicBot is a chatbot that bridges the gap between celebrity icons and their fans. Vishakha and Sandesh flew in all the way from India to participate in the ELEVATE meetups. They started off building their first chatbot for Vishakha herself as she is a famous actress and film producer in India with a fanbase of more than 1 Million users. After a successful launch, IconicBot already was able to win their first paying customer – Sri Thenandal Studios Ltd, a big film production company in India. IconicBot designed an AI-based chatbot to promote ‚Mersal’, which is considered one of the most-awaited films of 2017 in India. Combined with their two independent celebrity bots, IconicBot gained access to more than 9 Million Facebook users. Their bots processed already almost 1.7 Million messages. Vishakha was also accepted to the ‚She Leads Tech’ Initiative of Facebook and FB start, which further increases their network of business partners. Their next steps are to reach out to more celebrities and the big film & media houses. Selly Selly sells the stuff you no longer need. Despite being only 20 years old, Viktor and Vincent know how to do business. Besides ELEVATE, they were accepted for the LMU Lab, an incubator program in Munich that counts success cases such as Foodora and Flixbus as their alumni. Viktor and Vincent launched their bot Selly during the Demo Day. They used Viral Loops to already create a waiting list for interested people until their bot was ready to take orders. Users were able to move up the waiting list for each friend they invited. People were so eager to use Selly that over 25% of people shared it with their friends and the waiting list was filled with more than 230 potential orders after 3 weeks. They now focus on converting these numbers to orders and are currently in talks with several investors. Jingle Jingle, now consisting of Luke, Greg and Kevin, made it their goal to re-invent local shopping. The company came to life in August 2016 and as with most start-ups, Jingle had its ups and downs. However, through participating in incubation programs such as the WKO rocket science academy and as a team at the INiTS start-up camp, Jingle showed continuous progress. During their time at ELEVATE, Luke and Greg found their perfect fit with Kevin and hired him as CTO. At the Demo Day, they were able to convince the crowd and were awarded the ‘community award’ for the best pitch. This further encouraged talks with potential investors & partners. Luke, Greg & Kevin also received an invitation to share their knowledge and hold a keynote for the Handelsverband Österreich. Many people and retailers have expressed their interest in working with Jingle, which will be their main focus point for the upcoming weeks. So what do you think? It’s a pretty great bot family we’ve been growing those past 6 months, right? We could not be prouder and cannot wait to see what their future holds! And now: on to Batch #2 – let’s see what the next 6 months will bring!","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8436_EAP_171123_TheVentury_Elevate-1-1-377x220.jpg","September 18, 2017","en",0.996787071228027,0.00191485288087279,0.70824807882309,0.00282475422136486,0.287012249231339
"https://theventury.com/blog/tech-at-rise/","TheVentury","Robots, ML & MVP – Tech Insights from RISE’19","As part of our Asia blog-series, I would now like to focus on what I learnt at the RISE conference in Hong Kong from a tech-perspective.I have put together the top tech trends that were discussed at this enormous event, starting with giving you insights about the talks by UBER, Google, about Machine Learning and Robots:The MVP of Uber Eats (according to Uber)So, let’s say you work at Uber and your task is to prototype a new service (Spoiler: later called Uber eats), that should use existing Uber infrastructure to deliver food to your new customer target group.Easy, right? You commission 300 person days on IT services, build an entire app on the existing infrastructure, and launch it worldwide. ….. ah NOPE! What you do is you build an MVP to test your idea FIRST. But what people often forget is that an MVP needs to be a complete workable solution – often low tech, simple, but incorporates the essence of your service or product. And I think Uber, the high-tech, lots-of-money, rich IT resources company, did that perfectly. So here is what they focused on:They hired 3 rental cars with drivers in New York City and gave them mobile phones. Then they filled those rentals card’s trunks with premade Sandwiches. And the Hardware: done.Afterwards they launched a very simple landing page, with 1 call-to-action: “Order Sandwich now”. This button led to a primitive form where users can enter their address. No payment provider yet. All cash – keep it simple) and after submitting they would just pass on the request to the driver via SMS, who would deliver the sandwich and collect the money.Done.Super simple! Low tech! Quick to iterate on! But still incorporating the essence of the later full Uber Eats vision. Well done Uber.After that they of course had many more iteration, but this examples nicely demonstrates that am MVP can be very simple and low tech but still provide the necessary insights you need to iterate WITH your customers.The best explanation on MLSometimes new tech insights are not coming from a pure technical perspective but from explaining it better to your peers, so that there is a better and broader understanding of what is happening.Take Machine Learning as an example here. Complicated Matter. Lots of math. Quite revolutionary.So how would you explain it to a non-tech person?Cassie Kozyrkov (@quaesita) from Google has a brilliant approach – here is how it goes: In very traditional programming, we feed the computer with exact instructions, on what it should do. Do that calculation, run that program, sort that table. The computer would than “stupidly” execute those commands one-after-another and then output the result. That way of working has served us very well, and the results are very predictable. *But let’s say you now need to build a program that classifies images as whether there are cats or dogs in them.*except if you mess up the instruction, which is then called a bug <U+0001F600>Well, quite a challenge to formulate ALL the rules that make up the pixels to distinguish one from the other – you have to factor in form, structure, color and countless others.But wouldn’t it be nice to just show the computer some examples (!) and let the algorithm figure out all the instructions in the background – like “programming by example”, rather than by concrete instructions. Well that is basically what machine learning is.And it also explains nicely, why ML sometimes fails. Because it hasn’t learned some corner cases, and therefore was not able to factor in the instructions. In our example: if you feed it a tiger, but there was none in the training that classifies it as a “cat”, how should the algorithm know.Bringing it to that fitting abstraction level is quite a challenge, but now you have at least an explanation for machine learning.Robots, Robots everywhereAnother thing that struck me at RISE was the amounts of Robots that was presented and present. Truly the influence from cities like Shenzhen (see our blog about the Greater Bay Area) was clearly visible. Especially Robots for elderly and service tasks were prevailing. This is understandable especially in an aging Asian society that is focused on service industry (in HK)Overall RISE Conf was an amazing experience for us. We were able to present us, our services and also our new product BotBase there and got a lot of encouraging but also critical feedback.Get in touch!Do you have any questions or are interested in our Machine Learning / AI Services?

"https://theventury.com/blog/topicmodeling/","TheVentury","Machine Learning Prague 2019 – Topic Modeling","Two weeks ago we attended the “Practical conference about ML, AI & Deep Learning applications” – Machine Learning Prague 2019 from February 22nd – 24th, 2019. We had a great time at the conference and were truly able to deepen our knowledge in the field of ML. Two of our most relevant areas of ML that we would like to cover are “Topic Modeling” (in this post) and “Anomaly Detection” in the second part (coming soon). Let’s get started!Topic Modeling with Machine Learning We heard about a large variety of interesting applications of Machine Learning. We heard a very interesting talk from Alexander Loosley at Data Reply called “Solving the Text Labeling Challenge with EnsembleLDA and Active Learning”. He discussed how to effectively identify and label topics within a huge corpus of text. We are interested in this topic at TheVentury because it has a wide variety of potential applications and it builds from our experience in Natural Language Processing. Discovering topics in social media posts One of the great things you can do through topic modeling would be to summarize what customers are saying through social media and automatically discover the most important message topics. This can guide you to address the most relevant issues for your customers and can also flag critical messages as they come in. In the presentation Alexander discussed the EnsembleLDA method to robustly identify topics. LDA stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is a Machine Learning method commonly used to cluster data by topics. EnsembleLDA is the procedure by which LDA is repeated multiple times with different random starting points so that the most robust topics can be identified. This method gives confidence in the topic labels so that they can be used in analysis or other business applications.Discovering topics in emails Topic Modeling can also be used to categorize and label emails. For example, important information is contained in the many emails that are sent and received about a project or the company. By using Machine Learning, emails are categorized by their major topics, and can be further categorized into smaller topics. This allows you to categorize, explore, and summarize the relevant information in the emails. Super useful!Using Topics to sort and search documentation Another application for Topic Modeling is to categorize internal documentation. If you or your employees spend significant time searching through internal documentation, you can greatly improve this experience using Machine Learning. We can make it easy to quickly find the correct document through keyword searches based on topics.Visualization With any of these applications, it is important to be able to visualize and explore the data and topics. Alexander showed some interesting visualization methods which help to understand the data, improve the methodologies, and produce the most accurate topic models. It was a highly engaging and interesting talk! Thanks again Alexander!Next upIn my next blog post we will be discussing “Anomaly Detection” which was also widely discussed at the #mlprague!

Was the site appealing, easy to navigate, easy on the eyes?If not, this might have been due to underdeveloped User Interface and User Design – Luckily the ones of our ELEVATE teams are great. Thanks to Natalie Korotaeva. The importance of user interface and user experience Natalie is the expert who recently taught our accelerator batch about User Interface Design and creating an appealing Customer Experience. And despite her being modest and (rightfully) stating that each and every workshop topic is essential in its own right, the importance of UI/UX must not be underestimated.After all, lots of startups could succeed in their endeavours – if they just improved their User Interface. Be it redesigning the user on-boarding process or making your Call-To-Action more appealing – these things can radically change your conversion and retention rates. But why is that? The struggles of entering a crowded marketIf you create a new product in an existing market you need to make it ten times better than other current ones.Launching a product in a crowded market is hard, but it is not impossible. Examples for some apps or platforms that managed to be successful in these circumstances are Revolut and N26. Why? Because they have user-friendly interfaces, are modern, appealing and well designed (besides their technological and product innovations). The UI trendAnd it’s time to get on the train now – the industry is constantly developing. Natalie sees the trend of UI & UX going greatly towards voice interfaces, which will also create some challenges. How do you create an interface without having an actual, visual screen? How to handle errors? How do you do A/B-testing to understand whether the user is satisfied with their experience?These are problems and challenges that will need to be tackled sooner rather than later. TheVentury is actively working on them, be it in our everyday work with conversational interfacing or with ELEVATE: Batch’s 3 team Espresso Labs is focusing on non-visual voice interfaces in the hospitality industry for example – things are moving forward fast. Tips & tricks for prospective UI designersTo get started, Natalie has the following recommendations for tools and resources.Figma for designing digital screens and providing first visual insights.To design digital products, she highly recommends FramerAnd if you are completely new to the topic, she recommends starting with this book Lastly, Natalie gave us a valuable tip to redirect to entrepreneurs and UI designers, neatly packing it into her favourite quote from the movie “The Founder”:“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” So, stay persistent!

It’s going to be a bumpy night.”Originating from 1950s “All about Eve”, this is the quote Pooja Ahluwalia chose to describe her startup-mentality. Out of context this might have sounded weird, but these words are coming from someone that loves working with startups.“More than anything what excites me most is to see the commitment and love they have for building something unique and innovative.”This mentality of not only sharing knowledge but also learning so much about the industries and their respective challenges is what made Pooja a vital part of Vienna’s startup community: She works as a Growth Marketer at TheVentury, Mentor for TheGrowthbase as well as a lecturer at FH St.Pölten. Now she recently helped our ELEVATE teams with solving a really important problem:Who is your customer?Following Valentina’s workshop on “What problem is being solved” Pooja asked our teams a significant question: “Whose problem is being solved?”. Clearly identifiy and articulate your User Personas. If you don’t know whom the product is tailored for, how do you know who to ask for feedback? How do you know who to target in your marketing efforts?That’s why Pooja’s workshop was centered around creating specific user personas: Exemplary customers to represent and visualise their challenges. What problem do they need solving, what is their motivation? How would they get to know your company? What values do they associate with? Pooja helped the teams with creating two personas each, even going as far as naming them and finding a representative look.Without understanding why a specific user would use your product, you will not be able to approach the right people.Pooja’s “secret” tipHer number one tip to give to startups is to not start working on marketing once you think your product is ready. Instead seek feedback and validation through all channels – Always involve your customer in product development. And, of course:Stick to the lean approach – work with hypothesis driven tests from day one.

"https://theventury.com/blog/utm-tracking/","TheVentury","What is UTM tracking and why you desperately need it","One of the most amazing things of current digital marketing campaigns is the ability to instantly cluster and segment your incoming users. If let’s say your grandfather or -mother, or even your parents had a business back in the day, they also relied on advertisement. However, they did not have the ability to instantly see, if their campaign was successful or not and had no way to adapt the campaign on the fly – like with UTM tracking nowadays.In this day and age however you can easily see how much a click costs, how much a lead costs, what you spent to make that one sale – if you choose to implement UTM codes. If you don’t do it, well then you should not even put “Basic knowledge in digital marketing” in your resume.What is a UTM code and why will it help me?UTM Codes are added to a URL to make the traffic from sources visible. They will not alter the destination of the URL, it only adds more information for either Google Analytics or other analytic tools.URL without UTM code: “https://www.theventury.com” (tells you nothing about the traffic source)URL with UTM: “https://www.theventury.com?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=lead_acquisition_nov16” (tells me in Google Analytics, that the traffic is from Facebook, from our TheVentury page, and the goal of the post was to generate leads in November 2016)So you say it’s to much work to do it? You don’t want to burden yourself with yet another task? Think again! The UTM Tracking will help you to easily segment your incoming traffic and furthermore to identify and compare potential funnels you want to invest time and money into! It will have a major impact on your ROI calculation.Available UTM codes:UTM_sourcewill be used for defining the platform/page you posted (e.g.: facebook / linkedin / hackernewsUTM_medium will be used for defining the subpage where it was posted (eg.: for Facebook the group/page ID // for linkedin the group ID…)UTM_campaign will be used for defining if it was a paid ad (paid), a manuell posting (man)…UTM_content can be used to add further information (if campaign=man then we can define who posted)UTM_term (not often used) e.g. a keywordHow to built your own URLs for campaigns or social media activities with Google URL BuilderThere are different ways to build your own UTM codes for your URLs – for the beginning you can use Google’s URL Builder Tool – which is quite nice if you just have a few URLs now and then to generate.I have pre-filled the fields we would use for a link in our newsletter about growth hacking.As you can see, you just need to copy paste the URL that the builder is spitting out and of you go. The Google URL Builder even has a URL shortener for your convenience.UTM Link Builder Pro TipIf you have a lot of links to “spice” up, the Google URL Builder is not necessarily the best solution since it will take a lot of time to do process all.

The Human Voice is the most perfect instrument of all. – Arvo PärtWe think that voice is not only the most perfect instrument, but also the future to meaningful brand interaction.Conversational interfaces, or chatbots, already make it possible to have quality voice conversations between businesses and customers today. We expect this trend to rise much further. Why?Request by voice assitants are going to tripleVoice assistants are the fastest-growing connected device category in history, as researched by Deloitte.According to a recent forecast from Juniper Research, the use of voice assistants is expected to triple over the next few years:About 8 billion voice assistants will be in use by 2023 – compared to 2.5 billion as of end 2018. Most of these will be Siri or Google Assistant, based on smartphones.Google Assistant is expected to reach 1 billion devices (as of January 2019)Amazon´s Alexa has reached 100 million devices (December 2018)Apple HomePod grew at 45% and sold 1.6 million units in the fourth quarter of 2018Thus, voice commerce will grow immensely – and is expected to reach $80 billion per year by 2023.One good example for this is Expedia: The digital travel agency already created browse and book capabilities using google assistant last fall.Research author James Moar explains “connected TVs and smart displays [will be] vital here, as they can provide a visual context that is lacking in smart speakers.”To give you a better understanding of the positive signs in voice technology, we collected four broader signs which stand for a bright future. 4 Signs for a bright future for voiceNew EntrantsGoogle, Amazon, Apple – Wasn´t there another big… Oh yes, Samsung! The Bixby-powered Galaxy Home speaker will arrive on the market by April 2019. We hereby declare the battle for market shares. Interesting times ahead!Things are being built, measured, learnedBuild, measure, learn – that´s just the way innovation goes. The impact of time, scale and consumer trust on product progress should not be underestimated. More data and more user engagement will fuel Natural Language Processing technologies, just as increased search queries aided Google’s search. Just recently it has been announced that millions of Alexa interactions are currently being tapped and analyzed to decrease NLP error rates by 8% and thus advance the quality of voice interfaces. While voice technologies are improving at a pace, the experiences of today will only increase. The fact that voice devices are being adopted by more and more consumers leads to trust in the channel – and we will be able to do much more with voice than we can think of now.Multi-Channel Magic“The innovation is natural language processing, not smart speakers or chatbots” Charles Cadbury (2018). The real magic happens when conversations go cross-platform, thus voice should not be seen as an interface that will forever replace screens in the long run, but rather as a precious addition to the conversation landscape.ReferencesThe more the success stories, the more companies will follow by investing in an innovation. Often innovation practitioners struggle with getting budget for an early exploration of burgeoning technology. Once brands realise they have to catch up with the ecosystem, those already engaged will be at the front foot.With the rise of multi-platform assistants, the use of standalone apps is expected to decline. That makes a lot of sense considering how seamless interactions with brands can become if they take place on text and voice assistants, powered by multi-channel enterprise platforms. While voice is advancing, make sure to get your business ready by setting up multi-channel communication opportunities with your customer.

"https://theventury.com/blog/web-summit-2019/","TheVentury","How AI will disrupt communication – Insights from Web Summit 2019","In the following article, I will talk about the insights we gained at the Web Summit 2019 in Lisbon, specifically in the field of conversational interfaces and how a “build once – use forever” mentality does not work for bots. In the following blog I will share my learnings on automating communication through bots.Web Summit 2019, Lisbon, Portugal Web Summit is the world’s largest tech conference, where 75.000 people from all around the world come together to connect, network and most importantly get inspired!One of the first observations I made was that most participants fit into one of the following 2 categories:The “I’m here on a mission and got my to-do list ready” typeThe “let’s see what this is all about” typeMy personal approach was to find a good balance between the two!I invested 2 days talking to a variety of different people with the clear goal to understand their struggles and pain points related to the automation of communication flows. Our aim was to understand how we can help them automate communication through bots!On the third day, we represented BotBase at our own booth.How AI will disrupt every aspect of communicationAfter listening to many talks by industry experts and talking to some highly driven individuals, I have put together my top 3 most important conclusions on the topic of AI and communication.1. AI will disrupt how business communicateWe all have experienced at least one of those chatbots on websites or Facebook-Pages, right? As great as the idea sounds, many conversational interfaces from the last years could not live up to user expectations. Instead of providing value to customers, they often left them irritated. For this reason, many managers I spoke to associated buzzwords like “Chatbot” with negative experiences.However, through leveraging AI it is now possible to build a new generation of intelligent bots that can really understand user needs through applying Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques. When combining an in-depth understanding of users desires with integrated access to enterprise data sources, bots are empowered to provide intelligent and very bespoke answers. This obviously leads to a high level of customer satisfaction as a consequence. This new opportunity opens doors to automate many communication flows that up until now needed to be done by humans.It will affect how businesses and brands communicate with their customers. In the same way it will revolutionize how internal communication processes within large enterprises will evolve.2. New enterprise solutions are needed to build outstanding conversational experiencesMost communications experts argue that the way we currently interact on digital channels is very badly aligned with natural human behavior. Most businesses still communicate entirely one-directional to customers by putting content on their company website or running marketing email campaigns.WHY is it like this? – Well… here is what people at Web Summit 2019 told me: It is way simpler for them. And for most of them it worked pretty fine until now. On the other side, efforts to implement conversational interfaces have caused a lot of pain.In the past the tools available to automate communication, especially towards customers, have either not convinced business decision makers yet or failed to meet their expectations. Although this still holds true today, many of them admitted that they are open to testing new approaches that promote more bi-directional communication. The trend will definitely go in this direction and the solution that will hit the most relevant pain points best has a huge potential to gain significant attention in the enterprise segment. Many people from functional departments like Customer Support, Marketing or Human Resources explicitly mentioned that they would actually prefer having easy-to-use tools at hand that help them in creating and managing conversational interfaces.I felt their deep desire to move fast and constantly monitor interactions of external or internal users with their intelligent bots to keep making them smarter. All within their specialized departments without much dependency on IT departments.3. Intelligent bot solutions require continuous optimisationOne misconception I could spot on many people’s mind was related to how conversational interfaces should be managed. A fundamental reason why most implemented solutions are not successful in a sustainable way is that the constant need for adaptation is not considered. It was specifically interesting to hear from Felipe, a representative of a small south-american bank, that exactly the lack of continuous advancement of their bot solution was the key reason why their project was had to be stopped at last. A “build once – use forever” mentality doesn’t work with bots.This is because the way we communicate as well as the channels we use are undergoing constant change. When companies conduct one-time projects to automate internal communication or part of their communication with customers, this frequently causes problems. Companies need to maintain the possibility of constantly adapting these interfaces.Specifically in an agile organization the requirement to respond flexibly and fast to changing user behavior is key. This comes with the need to optimize automated communication flows based on real-time analytics.AI is only as good as the data it is trained on. User interactions provide new training data on an ongoing basis.To summarize…Communication is at the heart of success in any business and yet I’m still convinced that it is an undervalued topic by many business owners. A vast majority of people I talked to agreed that the trend goes increasingly towards conversational communication flows. Most of them mentioned that they are currently open to take steps in this direction.It was great to see peoples’ huge interest in BotBase, our own solution to automate enterprise workflows and communication. We are currently working very hard on advancing our enterprise solution.The great enthusiasm in our approach in providing an all-in-one platform for building, monitoring and optimizing intelligent bots and receiving constant valuable feedback from our clients is proving that we are on the right track.

It’s safe to say that we couldn’t be more excited about it!January 24th kicked off what will be a fantastic bot year – and it’s great to see that the interest in chatbots and conversational interfaces has only gotten greater. Vienna once again proved to show that it is still one of the biggest bot hubs in the world!In a whirlwind of a night, Greg Leuch shared some secrets of Poncho and how it became the world’s favorite bot, Prashant Pitti talked about NearGroup’s unconventional growth hacks and Susann Fischer & Markus Brunner gave insights into discovery & possibilities of bots on Facebook Messenger. Thanks to all of them for flying all the way to Vienna from NYC, Delhi, Dublin and London and for making it a night worthwhile.Our Key Learnings:Obviously, we don’t want to withhold all these insights from you. So without further ado, here are our 4 Key Learnings from “World of Chatbots – The Grand Meetup”:Markus Brunner, Facebook Messenger: “How do we build chat experiences that people will love?” was the main theme here. Markus a couple of tips on that: “Start small, dream big” – Just get started and try with a basic use case. Build it up from there.“Be honest, don’t pretend” – Don’t pretend not to be a bot. Be honest and educate your users about the limitations of your bot.“Learn and improve continuously” – Keep learning from user feedback. Check conversations, learn where users get stuck and improve your bot constantly.Greg Leuch, Poncho“Build emotional connections with your users”If there is one thing we can learn from Poncho, it is how to build conversational experiences users can relate to and have fun with. Through adding little comments here and there Poncho is giving users a glimpse of his life, making him a character with a history like you and me. Susann Fischer, Facebook“Really think about how the welcome screen resonates with your service and how you can use a little bit of text to get people excited to get started. ” We all know how hard it can be to keep it short and interesting at the same time. But Susann really stressed the fact that you only get one shot to make a good first impression. So make it count and use the welcome screen wisely.Prashant Pitti, NearGroup“Ask your users what they want” So simple, so obvious – yet, how many of us actually apply it? This tip continues to work out very well for NearGroup, as the team doesn’t have to worry about what feature to launch next – their users will tell them. It also makes users more excited about the product, as they feel valued and have a say in what happens next. Definitely a tip to keep in mind for your next feature-implementation.Next chance: Demo DayIn case you missed it: you can find the photos of our event here. Your next chance to attend one of our bot events will be our ELEVATE Demo Day on May 23rd – definitely make sure to save the date!Thanks to all of you for your interest, for coming and for staying for a beer or two afterwards – we hope you had just as much fun as we did and can’t wait to see you all again soon at our Demo Day!Psssst: If you found your passion for conversational interfaces, machine learning or growth hacking at our event – or if you’ve always been passionate about it – we are currently hiring.

Die Eltern vielleicht sogar öfters. Zarte Annäherungen an das Mysterium Internet. Wenn Emails sich nicht öffnen lassen oder Googles erste 10 Treffer nicht das gewünschte Ergebnis liefert, ist der Griff zum Handy nicht mehr weit und der Sohn oder die Tochter muss einspringen. In langsamen Schritten nähern sich ältere Menschen dem Internet und Mobile Devices an. Am Willen und Eifer das WWW zu entdecken fehlt es nicht. Wie kann man denn sonst mit seinem Enkerl oder Kind kommunizieren, die nie Zeit haben? Während die Jugend spielerisch mit elektronischen Medien hantiert, ist es für die ältere Generation in etwa so, als würden sie Chinesisch lernen. Eine Brücke zwischen den Generationen Mit dem Startup qualitaetszeit.at gründeten Daniela Weinholtz und Kornelius Pesut 2013 ein Projekt um diesen Gap zwischen Alt und Jung zu verkleinern. Den Social Impact Award 2015 und ein Stipendium für den Social Impact Start (SIS) konnten die beiden als erste große Erfolge verbuchen. Erfahrung mit dem Thema können die beiden genug aufweisen. Waren sie doch Trainer beim “A1 Internet für alle Campus”. Dort hatten sie die Möglichkeit die Teilnehmer jeden Alters für die digitale Welt fit zu machen. Digital Coach als Jobchance für die jungen Digital Natives Die Gründer hatten noch einen weiteren Plan mit ihrem Projekt. Den Fokus nicht nur auf die ältere Generation setzen, sondern auch auf die Jugend war den beiden ebenfalls ein Anliegen. In 2-tägigen Workshops wollen Daniela und Kornelius jungen Interessierten zeigen, wie man die ältere Generation als “Digital Coach” in der elektronischen Welt unterstützten kann und dabei auch noch Geld verdient. Einzelcoachings mit Senioren sollen mit 25 bis 35 Euro vergütet werden. Der Workshop bietet Jugendlichen die Chance einen Job zu machen der ihnen leicht fällt. Gegen die derzeitige Orientierungslosigkeit bei der Jobsuche der jungen Menschen wird ebenfalls gesteuert. Derzeit laufen die Vorbereitungen für das Trainingskonzept der “Digital Coaches” auf Hochtouren. Das SIS als idealer Support Im Impact Hub Gespräch erzählten sie uns von ihren weiteren Plänen und den Erfolg des SIS-Awards: Daniela und Kornelius wollten loslegen, Macher sein. Mit der Bewerbung beim SIS wollten die Medienpädagogin Daniela und der Mediendesigner Kornelius ihr Projekt in die Welt loslasssen. Neben ihren normalen Jobs war der Plan viel Erfahrung mit Startups zu sammeln. Paysafecard konnte mittlerweile als Sponsoring-Partner gewonnen werden. Mit diesem starken Partner haben sie finanziellen Support gesichert und ein Netzwerk in Marketing und Buchhaltung aufgebaut.

The staff in the mental health institution had a difficult time with him. In the end he was released without a cure. In the same year he married an ex-prostitute and found some stability in his life and the love for his work. That man was the social scientist and philosopher Auguste Comte. He was a proponent of altruism – the philosophic approach of pursuing happiness through helping others. Do good and earn good.coins Christoph Hantschk and Philipp Wasshuber aren’t mentaly ill, but do follow Auguste Comte philosophic view. 2014 they founded bgood.at, a startup that engages social engagement and ecologial sustainability. Philipp, a teamleader of boyscouts and Christoph, an alumni in economics want to believe that small gestures can change the world in a good way. Be it that you avoid plasticbags or volunteer in institutions like Caritas. With their startup the two founders want to reward such tiny contributions. Lets say, Peter wants to teach young migrants his mother tongue German. For this commitment he receives points, so called good.coins. With enough good.coins he gets rewarded with a movieticket or free pass to a fitnesscenter. With their idea the two entrepreneurs won the Social Impact Award 2015 and got a stipend for the Social Impact Start. Pitching and spreading the word of bgood is their daily business. Companies show social and environmental commitment For both companies and bgood this project is a win-win situation. Christoph and Philipp’s business partners and companies get the chance to present their social and environmental engagement. The startup in return receives a small comission for bringing new customers to the companies. Christoph gathered already some startup experience. His previous project was heiligerstuhl.at. The seats of the former home stadium Rapid are redesigned and sold to real fans of the club. Some of the revenues are given to the support of the Rapid-Youth. Franchise in Australia The idea of bgood is scaling. An affiliate of bgood is planned in Melbourne, Australia. For the next stage of bgood the founders are raising 100.000 Euro to continue their ambitious ideas. A crowdfunding project is their pipeline and the search for investors is on the way. “Superpowers like Batman” In an Impact Hub Vienna Interview Christoph and Philipp talked about their project and the challenges of being in the SIS-Programm. 1) What were your expectations when applying for SIS?My expectation were to get feedback from people who have a lot of experience in big companies like SAP, get visibility for bgood and get to know interesting people. 2) What was the 1 most important thing you learned from being part of SIS? We got the chance (thanks to our great mentor Ruth for organizing this) to pitch our business solution to the CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer) from SAP. A meeting on this level was a great lesson and we learned a lot from it. 3) What is the project you are currently working on? bgood is the first platform that measures the social and environmental impact of individuals and rewards people for their actions. On bgood people find information what they can do. People can choose from over 100 different social and environmental tasks. For example avoiding a plastic bag by using reusable bags, saving co2 emissions by riding a bike instead of driving a car or even teaching a migrant child their mother tongue. Everybody who registers collects points (good.coins) for their actions. With these good.coins our users can buy cool rewards.4) How did the SIS award change your venture story?Winning the SIS award was great motivation boost for us.5) What was your most recent success moment? We recently were selected from over 350 european startups as one of the 16 finalists of the european innovation tournament held by the European Investment Bank. Beside that we won the Social Impact Award and entered the first round of the Innovate for Climate Challenge. Personally I am always happy when we reach an internal milestone. For example a few weeks ago our community reached the milestone that 5000 tasks have been completed on bgood. Now we are almost at 7000 and I cant wait for 10000! 6) What is an absolutely random fact about you that everybody should know? I am addicted to ice cream and can easily eat a big cup Ben and Jerrys without blinking. 7) What impact do you want to have in the next years? I want bgood to grow to 5 million users by 2020 to help people to decrease their ecological footprints and life their lives in a more sustainable way. 8) What super hero power would you like to have and why? I am a big batman fan and I love technology. Therefor I would love to have his power to create awesome technology that helps mankind.

Er hatte eine arrogante aber auch gewinnende Persönlichkeit. Die Ärzte in der Heilanstalt verzweifelten an diesem besonderen Patienten. Schließlich wurde er ohne Heilung entlassen. Im selben Jahr heiratete der Mann eine ehemalige Prostituierte und fand in seinem Leben wieder Stabilität und die Liebe zu seiner Arbeit. Die Rede ist vom Sozialwissenschafter und Philosoph Auguste Comte, dem Begründer des Altruismus. Dieser philosphischer Ansatz spricht vom Streben nach persönlichen Glück indem man Anderen hilft. Tu Gutes und verdiene good.coins Christoph Hantschk und Phillip Wasshuber haben keine psychischen Störungen, leben aber nach Comtes philosophischer Sicht. Mit bgood.at starteten die beiden 2014 ein Projekt, das auf Nachhaltigkeit und soziales Engagement baut. Phillip, ein ehrenamtlicher Pfadfinderleiter und Christoph ein VWL-Absolvent, sind überzeugt, dass man mit kleinen Taten die Welt verbessern kann. Sei es beim Einkauf auf die Plastiktüte verzichten oder sich ehrenamtlich bei der Caritas betätigen.. Um mit diesen kleinen Taten einen Beitrag zu für eine bessere Welt zu setzen, wollen die beiden Gründer solche Aktion belohnen. Würde Peter einem minderjährigen Flüchtling Deutschunterricht geben, kann er auf bgood.at seine gute Tat eintragen und Punkte bekommmen, so genannte good.coins. Hat Peter genug Punkte gesammelt kann er seine good.coins gegen einen Theaterbesuch oder Kinofilm eintauschen. Mit dieser Idee haben die beiden sozialen Entrepreneure den diesjährigen Social Impact Award gewonnen und sind im Programm des Social Impact Start aufgenommen worden. Ihr tägliches Business im SIS bedeutet pitchen und ihre Idee nach außen kommunizieren. Unternehmen zeigen ihr ökologisches und soziales Bewußtsein Für kooperierende Unternehmen und bgood.at bedeutet dieses Projekt eine Win-Win-Situation. Christoph und Philipp gewinnen Businesspartner und die Unternehmen bekommen die Chance ihr ökologisches und soziales Engagement zu zeigen. Namhafte Institutionen wie Caritas und Sonnentor sind schon an Bord. Die Finanzierung des Startups erfolgt über Provisionen mit den Partnerfirmen. Christoph Hantschk kann bereits einige Erfahrung mit Startup-Projekten vorweisen. Eine seiner früheren Ideen war heililgerstuhl.at. Stadionsitze aus dem ehemaligen Rapid-Stadion wurden an eingefleischte Fans als Designer-Möbel verkauft. Ein Teil des Gewinns ging an die Nachwuchsförderung des SK Rapid Wien. “Superkräfte wie Batman” Christoph und Philipp standen uns in einem Impact Hub Vienna Interview Rede und Antwort über ihr Projekt und die Herausforderungen im SIS-Programm. 1) Was waren eure Erwartungen nachdem ihr euch für das SIS beworben habt? Wir erhoffen viel Feedback von Leuten zu bekommen, die eine Menge Erfahrung in großen Firmen haben, wie z.B. SAP. Unsere Idee zu verbreiten und interessante Menschen kennenlernen. 2) Was war das Wichtigste das ihr im SIS gelernt habt? Durch unseren Mentor Ruth hatten wie die Chance den CSO-Chef (Chief Sustainability Officer) von SAP zu treffen und unsere Idee zu pitchen. Ein Meeting aus dem wir eine Menge Erfahrung sammeln konnten. 3) An was für einem Projekt arbeitet ihr im Moment? Bgood ist die erste Plattform die soziales und umweltfreundliches Engagement fördert und diese gleichzeitig belohnt. Auf bgood können Menschen erfahren was sie tun können um die Welt besser zu gestalten. Aus über 100 guten Taten kann man auswählen. Zum Beispiel beim Einkauf auf das Plastiksackkerl verzichten oder CO2 Emissionen sparen und mit dem Fahrrad in die Arbeit fahren. Ein gutes Beispiel ist es einem jungen Immigranten seine Muttersprache beibringen. Jeder der sich registriert kann good.coins sammeln und sie gegen coole Preise eintauschen. 4) Wie hat der SIS Award eurem Projekt geholfen? Der SIS Award war ein riesengroßer Motivationsschub für uns. 5) Was war euer letzter großer Erfolg? Wir waren unter den letzten 16 von 360 Startups beim European Innovation Tournament. Dieses Event wird von der European Investment Bank gesponsert. Parallel dazu haben wir den Social Impact Award gewonnen und sind in der ersten Runde des Innovate for Climate Challenge. Es freut mich immer, wenn wir einen Milestone erreichen. Vor einigen Wochen durchbrach unsere Community auf bgood die 5000 Task-Marke. Die 7000 sind ganz nahe und ich kann es kaum erwarten die 10000 zu durchbrechen. 6) Was sollten die Leute sonst über euch wissen? Ich bin Ice-Cream-süchtig. Ohne mit der Wimper zu schlagen verschlinge ich einen ganzen Cup Ben and Jerrys. 7) Welchen Impact wollt ihr in den nächsten Jahren erreichen? Bis 2020 wollen wie an die 5 Millionen User haben und den Menschen helfen ein nachhaltiges Leben zu führen. 8) Welche Superkräfte hättet ihr gerne? Ich bin ein großer Batman Fan und ich liebe Technologie. Daher hätte ich gerne seine Superkraft coole Technik zu entwickeln um den Menschen zu helfen. Franchise in Australien Der Ruf der Idee überbrückt sogar Kontinente. Mittlerweile laufen Pläne eine bgood.at Filiale in Melbourne, Australien zu launchen. Für das nächste Jahr benötigen die beiden 100.000 Euro.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/09/23/impact-hub-ventures-support-refugees/","ImpactHub","Impact Hub Ventures support refugees","Close to 80,000 people were refugees or asylum seekers in Austria in 2014, according to the UNHCR. The migratory flow caused by the Syrian crisis has increased this number in 2015 significantly. Civil society came together to welcome and assist the people who fled and many of our members have played a part in this. Here are some of the Hubbers projects: Flüchtlinge Wilkommen: Opening our doors to refugees (Winner Social Impact Award 2015) “Why shouldn’t refugees in Austria be able to live in shared flats (or other normal housing situations) instead of mass accommodation?”. As an answer, the website www.fluechtlinge-willkommen.at proposes individuals to open their house to refugees. After registration on the website, they are put in touch with a person who fled, via a refugee organization. Hosts can get some help to finance the rent, as recognized refugees are entitled to a certain amount of money to cover their housing needs. Talentify: Helping young refugees to learn German with peers Talentify is a social business aiming at establishing a sustainable peer-to-peer online platform that helps young people to develop their full potential regardless of their parents’ social or financial background. They started the initiative “Wir helfen!” in order for young refugees to learn German. The Austrian volunteers are 14 to 19 years old and based in Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland. Most of the young refugees are isolated minors. This project will also help them developing a trusting and friendly relationship. Magdas Hotel: The first hotel run by Refugees in Europe It has opened its doors and 78 rooms in February this year, in the Prater area. The trendy and cosy Magdas Hotel is the first hotel in Europe run by refugees. This social business founded by Caritas is providing high quality services to worldwide travellers in 27 languages. The team is composed of sixteen nationalities. A hotel wing is hosting foreign isolated minors, and dinners with refugees are regularly open to public. Topfreisen.at: Working in the area of international gastronomy with the asylum seekers (Social Impact Start 2014) The asylum seekers of the St Gabriel’s mission residency are employed by Topfreisen.at to prepare international meals. This project offers them “a chance to pursue meaningful employment and makes them proud to share their culture”. Topfreisen.at provides catering for private celebration or corporate events. Benefits are used to finance German courses, excursions and leisure activities. Use potential: Revolutionizing refugee camps (Social Impact Award Winner 2015) Use potential’s mission is “to allow for every refugee registered in a camp to document and use their most relevant skills to improve the living conditions and mental health of refugees worldwide”. At registration in the camp, every individual is asked about his/her most important skills and knowledge and contacted later on to be part of volunteer-groups. “All eligible inhabitants of the camp are invited to participate with their knowledge and expertise. By creating and participating, displaced people regain ownership”. Whatchado: Three jobs opening for refugees (Social Impact Award Winner 2011) Whatchado is a successful online video platform to “find people, job and career that match your interests”. Three jobs have been opened at Whatchado for recognized refugees. Knowledge of Arabic or Dari/Farsi and English is required, as well as video making skills (CV and motivation letter to be sent to [email protected]). A special channel “refugee stories” will be launched on the platform. Younited Cultures: Promoting cultural diversity (Social Impact Start Award 2014) To “celebrate migration” -its slogan-, Younited Cultures creates trendy scarves on which the story of successful immigrants is transformed into patterns drawn together with designers. Younited Cultures’ best-seller is a very colourful scarf that aims to become a symbol for cultural diversity. Andra Slaats, co-founder, is currently planning a “Celebrate Migration Tour” in Austria to change the perception on migrants.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/10/06/10-reasons-to-consider-crowdfunding-for-your-business/","ImpactHub","10 reasons to consider crowdfunding for your business","It is a fact that crowdfunding has already proven itself to be a successful alternative in acquiring money and it looks like this will not change any time soon. Of course a crowdfunding campaign is a lot of work but we’d like you to remember why it’s worth to think about starting your business with crowdfunding. So here are 10 advantages which might motivate you to do a crowdfunding campaign too. Crowdfunding is a relatively inexpensive source of funding Yes, you need to invest time in creating a crowdfunding campaign and sometimes you also need to invest money to create the materials you need for the campaign. But looking for an investment you have to do this anyway, so your investment of time or little money is not particular required for crowdfunding. You run your campaign by yourself and your team so you are able to control the costs of the campaign. You keep 100% ownership of your project Maybe you have already considered different ways to acquire money for the start of your business and every one has it’s own advantages and risks. We won’t talk you out of any way to find an investor but if you are willing to keep 100% of your business in your hands than crowdfundíng could be your choice ;). A campaign failure is not a dead end Alright let’s be honest: nobody is perfect and yes it happens that crowdfunding campaigns fail. So what?! It is not the end of everything and from a positive perspective a failure gives you the chance to get better. Learn from your mistakes, talk to other entrepreneurs and start over again. Maybe again with crowdfunding, maybe with another way to get your business financed. Just do it! You get the chance of minimizing your risk because you can test the market A crowdfunding campaign gives you valuable insights into the market and how your product/service will fit into it. You get the direct feedback from backers and you’ll get insights of the first round of preorders. This helps you to classify or adjust your business according to the market. If you run a good campaign this will give you potentially huge promotional effect Crowdfunding sounds like an easy way to get your business started but don’t forget: you are not the only one funding money this way. So get your stuff done and run a good campaign, which means to take your time and prepare the campaign properly. Therefore you need a communication strategy and an idea of the presentation flow on the platform. Think about how to pitch your business (video pitch, pictures, future plans, team, why crowdfunding, rewards, FAQs, how supporters can help) and you take another step to your success and also very important: you will get publicity Use the chance to win backers as promoters If you have convinced the crowd from the beauty of your idea and won their trust, they will help to spread the word because they also want to see your business on the market. But be careful: their trust is very precious. Don’t disappoint your backers! The campaign is a first test of your marketing strategy We talked already about the opportunity of failure and even if we assume that you will succeed with your campaign, crowdfunding also helps you to evaluate your marketing strategy. As written before you’ll get direct feedback from the crowd and this helps you to refine your strategy if needed. Full independence of product development With a campaign run by yourself and your team you are independent in terms of product development. As you read before you will get a lot of helpful insights with which you are able to improve your business. Get Feedback from your backers You read a lot of direct feedback so far and it seems this is one of the key advantages of a crowdfunding campaign. We think so too, because when and where do you have the chance to get feedback before your start your business from your potential clients? Besides the part where you just get feedback you can also work with it. Getting the “feed-backers” on board and figuring out how you can work together sounds like a win-win situation, don’t you think? Crowdfunding can help to access the second round of funding easier So your campaign succeeded. Congratulations! If you need a second round of funding money you already learned a lot and you are in the position to profit from your skills. So take a breathe because you fund your base from which you can build up your business and take the next steps. It seems that crowdfunding is in fact worth trying but for the sake of completeness we’d like to mention that there are risks too. Not every product is suitable for crowdfunding, it can be a demanding and complex project because you need to know how to manage the project & people involved with, you need active personal involvement because crowdfunding is build on trust, it is a difficult task to convince a mass of potential backers as opposed to a single investor, you will have a responsibility to the backer community and last but not least you will expose your idea to the public. Nevertheless crowdfunding is one way to acquire money for your business. So take your time and choose the way which fits best to get your startup financed and be kind to share your learnings with other entrepreneurs.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/10/07/newmembershippilotproject/","ImpactHub","We’re participating in the New Membership Pilot Project","We’re excited to let you know we are one of the fifteen Impact Hubs (along with Kings Cross London, Prague, Sao Paulo, Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, Stockholm, Belgrade, Bucharest, Brno, Ostrava, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam and Geneva) across the globe who will be piloting an upgrade of the Impact Hub Membership experience starting late September 2015. This blog will give you a bit of background about the project and of course explain the new opportunities for you as a Hubber. From our annual member survey we know that you are actually very happy with your local Impact Hub member experience (though it can be improved, naturally). This pilot project is about building upon local strengths and adding what you seem to miss most: better global connectivity and a sense of belonging. Therefore as Pilot Hubs we’ve worked hard to align the membership experience across Impact Hubs with the goal of being able to say: there is one Impact Hub Membership. You still have your Home Hub which is dedicated to personally hosting you, but you now have many “homes-away-from-home”. The experience and support you can expect in any Impact Hub will be the same. You are an Impact Hub member, not “just” an Impact Hub Vienna member. The pilot has three different phases and Phase 1 is just launching. What does Phase 1 mean for you as a Hubber? Updated membership model: Our product structure is now globally aligned to be more flexible and give you access to more opportunities (this image makes it clearer). Prices don’t change, but you will get more benefits. Membership of Impact Hub is the base. On top you can buy the services that fit your needs. And you can get services not just from your Home Hub, but also from other Impact Hubs. Meet and work in any Impact Hub: If you are a Hubber who travels you can meet up in any local Pilot Impact Hub (and somewhere in 2016, everywhere). If you also have a coworking package (starting at 10 hours – previously known as Connect+ to Workspace Unlimited), you can now use it in all Pilot Impact Hubs! If you use over 50% of your time in one other specific Impact Hub, we’ll ask you to get your coworking package in that specific Impact Hub. The only thing you need to do when you travel is say hi to the local host so we can arrange the administrative part without bothering you with it. As an optional service to you, you can go to passport.impacthub.net and check-in before you travel in order to be hosted better. Better and more recognizable events: we’ve sourced event best-practices from our network and selected 3 monthly events that will take place in all Pilot Hubs. They link to the value propositions #Inspire, #Connect, #Enable which are central to your membership experience. Are you a member who travels? You will know these events take place in other Impact Hubs and that it will be an easy way for you to connect with the local community. Build profile and gain visibility: we are building global communication channels, which you will be able to access and spread the word around your work. Not interested in gaining visibility? You will soon start receiving exclusive insightful stories from the global network. In the second and third phase we will add the following concrete changes for you: Virtual business opportunities: currently Membership is still quite space-centric. By using better virtual platforms we will increase the value proposition for you even if you don’t access the space frequently. Access a network of 11’000+ makers: with so many members, so many opportunities for collaboration and/or learning exist for you. We are building a better database of members and improve the way you can search for and connect with other members. We’re looking forward to test these changes with you and our fellow Pilot Hubs: Kings Cross London, Prague, Sao Paulo, Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, Stockholm, Belgrade, Bucharest, Brno, Ostrava, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam and Geneva. Is the Impact Hub you want to connect with not on that list? We are sure they’ll do their utmost to give you the same experience, but they can’t guarantee it. Yet :). Since this is a pilot project, we will need your help to figure out what value we are creating for you. What is working? What isn’t? Which other opportunities are we missing? Please tweet at us using #ImpactHubMembership and help making your Impact Hub Membership better, and get in touch with Dushan to share your feedback and ideas. Thank you very much!

As the numbers of our community grew so did our fields of interest, collaboration and action. In response to this emergent reality we aim to encourage the formation of sub-communities of members around a common field of interest, to collaborate and take action through the creation of Impact HubClubs. The Neongreen HubClub This is a first call to action for those members and future members that take Earth Centered Actions as entrepreneurs, investors, researchers, innovators, journalists, politicians, bankers, activists, public servants, corporates etc. Visionaries, doers and thinkers, people looking for solutions and those who have found one – you are all invited. Impact does not happen in isolation – it takes collective action, alliances, collaborations, and partnerships. If you are looking to increase the impact of your actions by joining forces with Earth-minded peers the Neongreen HubClub is your community. First Gathering: Divestment – where the money meets the planet The first gathering will tackle the intersection between money and planet: the risks for the earth are risks for the pocket. Divestment is a controversial topic. According to The Guardian, The founder of Microsoft and the Gates foundation criticised the global movement that has seen pension funds, universities, churches and local governments worth $2.6tn commit to pulling their investments out of coal, oil and gas companies. The follow up of the debate made Gates invest $2bn (£1.3bn) in breakthrough renewable technology projects over the next five years –double his investments to date. If you want to know or do more about this topic, join the debate at the first Neongreen HubClub on the 30th of October. Mr. Mark Campanale (Founder and Director of the London based “Carbon Tracker” Institute) will talk about the global divestment movement. Georg Günsberg and Wolfgang Rattay will present the events of a short study on divestment potential in Austria, funded by the Green Party. This will be followed by a discussion of the results, with the authors of the study, MP Christiane Brunner, Mark Campanale and a representative from the financial industry. The 1st “Neongreen HubClub” is hosted by NEONGREEN NETWORK and Impact HUB Vienna, in cooperation with the Green Party and the oekostrom PLC, Austria’s largest renewable energy company.

This year’s competition looked specifically for ideas that would promote ‘New Ways to Grow’ across European society. The idea behind the competition is to create and enable new kinds of economic growth that can create systemic change and a positive impact on society. The shortlisted ideas have the potential to bring value to individuals, communities, countries and entire regions, and reflect the issues and concerns at the heart of many Europeans’ lives. The innovations aim to create solutions and respond to concerns such as our ageing population, food waste, sustainable production, organic farming, and accessibility. The finalists come from Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia and Poland, and their ideas reflect the creativity of a generation of Europeans who have lived through boom and bust and have a vision to innovate to create a more sustainable growth model: Apiform – Sit-in beekeeping Bosnia and Herzegovina De Landgenoten Belgium LastMinuteSottoCasa Italy Mela Wear Germany Phee Greece Samaritan Mobile Care Complex Latvia Smart Hearing Aid Croatia The Freebird Club Ireland The Social Good Vending Machine Poland Wheeliz France The 30 semi-finalists attended a mentoring academy in Vienna in September where they worked with experts in social innovation to refine their ideas and develop their business plan before pitching to the jury. The jury is made up of successful social innovators from around Europe, who critically evaluate the strength of each organisation’s business plan and have selected the 10 strongest entries. Jury member and Ashoka Country Director for Poland Agata Stafiej-Bartosik commented: “I think I can speak for everyone involved when I say that selecting just 10 finalists was tough – we were inspired by the quality of the semi-finalists and by the drive and vision they demonstrated with their proposals. It’s fantastic to see that people are innovating all around Europe, these projects have real potential to create sustainable growth and a positive future. Congratulations to all the finalists.” Gabriela Sonnleitner, CEO of Magdas Social Business reflects: “It was a real pleasure to host the mentoring academy at our hotel in Vienna. We too were selected as finalists for the competition in 2013 – we didn’t win but the journey and support that we got from the competition really helped us to get where we are today – a thriving social business providing employment opportunities for refugees. The European Social Innovation Competition is about identifying great ideas, not all of them will win but being selected as a semi-finalist or finalist is a fantastic achievement. Keep going – your organisations can and will change the world, little by little and there is a network out there all across Europe ready to support you.” The ten finalists will pitch for their chance to win one of three €50,000 prizes on at the awards ceremony on the 25th November in Brussels.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/11/02/storytellinghackathon/","ImpactHub","1001 ISTANBUL – STORYTELLING HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL IMPACT","A good story has the power to change the world. Each day, thousands of change makers and creative heads all around the word create powerful stories and projects with the aim to create change, and to make the world a better place. All of these stories are worth it, being told, but how should they have an impact, if nobody knows them? How could we spread the word about current projects, problems and problem-solving social enterprises? Impact Hub Vienna and Impact Hub Istanbul asked themselves the same questions, and they even went one step further. They asked themselves „What would happen, if we would bring those change-makes and creative-heads together at a special place and allow them to collaborate and be creative for a limited amount of time!?“ Out of this questions, a great project, the >>1001 Storytelling Hackathon for social Impact<< arose, and I had the honor to be one of the participating creative-heads. >> TELL A STORY. MAKE A DIFFERENCE! << This was the motto, under which more than 30 creatives from all over Europe gathered in Istanbul – the place where storytelling has its roots – from the 9th to 12th of October, for the first European Storytelling Hackathon ever.The aim was to create sustainable solutions for 5 different social enterprises based in Istanbul. Those solutions were to be developed, presented and activated within the time limit of 48 hours. THE HACKATHON & THE RESULT After arriving in Istanbul and getting a feeling for the city while doing a food tour, we soon gathered at the lab, where we would would spend most of the time during the following days. The first evening was introduced by a great storyteller from Istanbul, who created a story around social impact for us. Perfectly in the mood of storytelling and social engagement, we got to know the 5 enterprises and their current situation. After deciding on woking-groups an a quite short night, the working flow started Saturday morning and would end only on Sunday evening around nine. During these hours we did brainstorming and idea collecting. We shot photographs and videos, edited them, wrote stories and put together whole web-pages and marketing-strategies together. Sunday-evening, after very little of sleep and many hours of intensive working, we got to the moment of presentation. Each of the projects surprised with great ideas and results. It is incredible, what can be achieved within such a little amount of time, if a group of creative and motivated people comes together and works for a common aim. The presentations were stunning, but what was even more overwhelming, was to see the happiness of the organizers and entrepreneurs that could hardly believe that so many young creatives had gathered, only to help them make their way. If one would calculate the value of the content that has been created during these two days, it would be an incredible large sum, but all the experiences and happy moments count more than any money. All in all, we spent some emotional intensive days ranking from excitement to tiredness, stress and exhaustion to happiness and joy. Especially the final round, when everybody shared his feelings, was truly powerful and emotional. THE IMPACT OF THE HACKATHON Social entrepreneurship might be perceived as „normal“ in many big cities of this world, but in Istanbul it has not reached normality yet. This is why the Impact Hub Istanbul aims to open its doors in order to create a space for the creative potential of the city. The Storytelling Hackathon functioned as a pioneering event of the local community in order to create awareness amongst external people and to communicate the values of the hub, upcoming projects and this working method. At this point you might think, „Well that’s great. You created social impact in Istanbul and helped these companies!“ but I can tell you that this hackathon created far more impact than awareness amongst local in Istanbul only. For the first time I realized what it means to be totally engaged in a project. I understood what it means to do something for others. I understood what co-working means, how to work together, how to develop ideas and how to use the individual abilities of each of the team-members and to combine them. I got to know how impact can happen in collaboration. I suddenly also understood what the Impact Hub is doing and how it really works. After this week-end, I feel far more connected to the Hub itself – not only to my team-members but to the whole community. A RESUMÈ after … 16 hours of sleep within four nights 48 hours of intensive work no access to facebook and twitter … i can look back onto … 5 great projects > 30 inspiring and fazinating personalities > 3 extraordinary solutions for the companies problems invaluable exeriences and contacts I am overwhelmed, happy and thankful that I was allowed to be part of such a great project. I am looking forward to see it happen again and to hopefully be part of it for a second time.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Header-600x400.jpg","November 2, 2015","en",0.996245682239532,0.000403080441174097,0.0279647684656084,0.000693084773956798,0.970939040184021
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/11/04/younitedcultures-migration/","ImpactHub","Younited Cultures celebrates migrant success stories with colorful scarves","Celebrate migration! Younited Cultures is turning successful migrant stories into colorful scarves. One of the founders Andra Slaats tells us the story of how that came about. Andra met her husband in Vienna and decided to move to Austria 10 years ago. After the difficult process of learning German she eventually found a job at an Austrian luxury cosmetics company. For six years, she got the opportunity to travel the world but at the same time she was confronted with discrimination in her own team. The experience inspired her to devote her time and creativity to the promotion of cultural diversity. Younited Cultures was set up by Andra and her partner Iulia Mugescu in 2014. The company creates trendy scarves which tell the story of successful immigrants with the help of designers. Supported by Impact Hub Vienna throughout her career as a young entrepreneur, Andra knows what she owes to those who have encouraged and supported her in the making Younited Cultures itself a success story. Impact Hub Vienna: What is Younited Culture? Andra Slaats: Younited Culture is a Vienna-based social enterprise using fashion as a statement for cultural diversity. Our goal is to identify impactful and inspiring success stories for every culture and telling them through a sustainable and locally made scarf. We produce items with a simple and elegant design and the slogan “Celebrate migration” IHV: How does it work? AS: Creating a scarf is an intriguing process. First, we identify and approach a successful immigrant. Then, our designer is going through a process of interview and design together with him or her. When the scarf is ready, it has to be approved by the immigrant. Finally, the prototype is sent for production in Austria or Italy. Our bestseller however is our signature scarf. A very colourful design that symbolizes cultural diversity. People wear the scarf to make a statement. It’s awesome! IHV: What is a successful immigrant? AS: I think it is someone who is integrated, runs his/her own business or has a job where he/she can create value, and who stays in Austria despites discrimination. Our first storyteller was a Polish woman, Adela Kuliga. She arrived in Austria 10 years earlier to be with her future husband. She left a promising career in her country to come to Vienna without speaking any German and without any job perspective. While engaging in menial jobs, she learned German and then worked as a professional trainer in the Integration sector. Later on, she funded an NGO “Networking Youth Career” for immigrants helping them on their career paths. Now she directly impacts the lives of more than 2,000 people every year. IHV: Tell us about your background. AS: I arrived in Vienna ten years ago. Love brought me here as well. I did not know a word of German and honestly didn’t like the language. In Romania, my country of origin, I was an Englis and French translator. As I had to find my way in Austria, I tried hard to learn German within a year, hoping that I would find a job in which I could grow into. I started working for an Austrian cosmetics company in International Sales. I was happy but unfortunately, I started to feel discriminated and unwanted within the team. During those six months, I suffered badly from this situation. I felt discouraged there was such a disconnect between my colleagues and friends. It took me two years to accept the fact that I could not change the people that I was working with but that I had to change jobs. My boss on the other hand was very supportive and she valued my knowledge and passion to work for her brand. Two years later I was made Export Manager. I travelled around the world, discovered rich and poor cultures, but experienced as well the way some suppliers were working with their employees. In China for example, I remember the tired faces of people working until 10pm. I will never forget that. After 3 years, I took a sabbatical leave to study Sales and Marketing Management and that year transformed my life. “The plants were dying all the time.” IHV: How did you become part of the Impact Hub network? AS: My brother introduced me to Impact Hub Vienna during my sabbatical leave in 2012. I started working on his project called “Window Farm”, a product in which plants can be grown in a closed loop system made out of recycled plastic bottles. As an added value, immigrant women with little chance to find work, would be employed on a flexible time for a few hours a week. Unfortunately, it did not work for me though. The plants were dying all the time. I don’t think it was a problem with the product but rather my gardening skills. I pitched for this project at the Social Impact Start in 2013 nonetheless. At that time, I had never spoken in public and never wanted to either. But I felt safe and inspired by other entrepreneurs who took risks and jumped in cold water every day. They were happy at what they were doing. Now, of course, I did not win the pitch, but the Social Impact Start opened a door. Alexis Eremia, co-founder and Managing Director of Impact Hub Vienna, asked me shortly after my presentation: “Why don’t you keep what motivates you [supporting people with different cultural background] but change the product? You obviously don’t feel passionate about the product but more about the impact it brought. So find a product that you like and have the same impact on migrants”. This was a turning point. We met the next week and brainstormed on products until we discovered it could be a fashion product. So she gave me the contact of a Latvian designer of scarves. IHV: How did you meet your partner? AS: While hosting at the IHV, I met Iulia Mugescu, the Marketing Manager of Younited Cultures. She is from Romania, like me, and was part of the IHV team. Previously she was President of AIESEC Austria a global platform for young people to explore and develop their leadership potential. “I am no longer scared to do things I am not comfortable with.” IHV: After the Social Impact Start, what was your next step? AS: In April 2014, I pitched for the Social Impact Start again. This time with our own product and we won! Matthias Reisinger, another co-founder and Director of Impact Hub Vienna later said “This is the difference between pitching a product and owning a product”. We were really enthusiastic and won an 8-month programme including 20 hours of expert advice, a full membership and co-working space at the Hub and mentoring from SAP. Later in August we won the Social Impact Start Award that brought us 5,000 euros. IHV: How did you finance your project? AS: We invested 5,000 euros at the beginning, won 5,000 euros from the Social Impact Start Award, 5,000 euros from crowdfunding and took a 10,000 euros credit. State funds were not possible due to the criteria they had. We just never fit the profile unfortunately. So we decided to get a bank credit. They were less fussy. IHV: What challenges have you been facing and how did you manage? AS: We wanted the whole production to be made in Austria, but the costs were really too high. We are now producing in Italy with a family company that has worked in textiles for generations. More generally, I am no longer scared to do things I am not comfortable with. I did so many. I jumped in cold water so often, that now it’s just like warm every time I do a new thing! I also hate doing things that I don’t like doing: Public Relations for example… Not fun, but it brings results. So, I do it. And now it’s kind of growing on me. I get to meet interesting people and journalists. “Thousands of potential success stories.” IHV: At what stage is Younited Cultures now? AS: In August 2014, we created a limited company. Six months later, we launched three products and got a lot of media coverage. Now, we are in the operations phase. Sales are done online, we open discussions with shops, participate at fairs. We also offer workshops for corporations, where they can create their own scarf in a team building effort. IHV: What did the IHV bring to your project? AS: What I really appreciate at the Hub is that everybody takes time to go deep into your project, no matter if he/she is a member or a co-founder. We are growing within this entrepreneur atmosphere where everyone is willing to help. There are also some other benefits as member of the Hub. In 2013 I won a €25,000 scholarship for an MBA in Sustainable Development Management. Thanks to this, I could meet investors, marketers and gain knowledge in strategy, sales, graphic facilitation and negotiations. There were experts from all around the world teaching classes. I am now writing my master thesis on women immigrants in top management positions in Austria. IHV: What is the next step you want to take? AS: We are organizing a “Celebrate Migration Tour” in Austria. We want to create some buzz in Austria for how migration can also be perceived as thousands of potential success stories.

Let’s picture one of them. Her name is Susi. She lives in Vienna and started a food blog a few weeks ago. In order to get some followers and build a community around her blog she launched an Instagram account aswell. She takes a picture of her latest creation, a sweet desert and uploads it on her Instagram account in the evening. A few minutes later she gets likes and comments on her post. All the engagement on her picture are from the US and asian countries and nobody from Austria, not even her friends are liking or dropping a post on her account. Plan your content in advance Even though Susi’s picture is gaining attraction she missed one point that boosts engagement. She didn’t consider the timing of her post on Instagram. In the US it is noon and in Europe/Austria it is around 8 pm. Everybody is having their dinner, watching TV and nobody has time to check their Instagram app. In order to get more people on her social media channels, Susi needs a schedule of when to post on her profiles. What to consider before posting? Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and many more social media channels are a great opportunity to spread the word about your business. They are perfect tools to gain followers and fans, who can share your posts and help you gain popularity. Keeping them updated is a great way to interact with your audience and to shape the quality of your product or idea. There are certain factors to consider when thinking about how and when to use your social media accounts: First ask yourself what are the benefits for your audience of your media post? Always think of value that you provide. Think of the channel you use! Is your business picture-driven, you should focus more on Instagram, for live feeds or quotes use Twitter. Timing is crucial! Set a day and time when to publish. It is always good to have pile of content, in case you run out. Regular and fixed dates help your followers know when to expect a new post from you. Finally think of the context. Does your post fit for Facebook, Twitter, etc. or does a blog post create more attraction? When are the peak times to post? The alpha in social media is still Facebook. With approximately 2 Billion users they serve as the role-model. Almost every company has a Facebook account and it is the first choice of startups for entering the social media world. People with an age range of 18 to 49 years use Facebook for private and business purposes. The best time to post are Thursdays and Fridays around 1 to 3 pm. Many people at work have their lunch break and parents check the internet during their child’s naptime. Instagram, owned by Facebook, is consistent throughout the week. According to Fortune Magazin the peak time of engagement is on Monday from 3 to 4 pm. Target groups are young people. But companies like Red Bull or BBC found the benefits of an account for building communities. An even more limited channel is Twitter. Only text with 140 characters, 30 second videos were integrated too. Right after Facebook it is the second most popular social media channel, but with only 241 Million users. During workdays companies mainly use Twitter for B2B or B2C. Users tend to browse through, create lists or press the „following“ button. Engagement from users shifted to the weekends. Neil Patel from Quicksprout says that around 5 pm are the highest rates of retweets and together with Instagram they aim for teens and business owners. Linkedin surfaced as the channel for professionals and it is obvious that high engagement rates can be located from Tuesday to Thursday from 10 to 11 am. In the middle of the workweek users are fresh in mind and ready to gain or spread knowledge. Millennials are the main user base for Linkedin, using it for branch news and professional advice. Examine yourself At the end take a look at yourself and track time when you use your social media accounts. Through this way you can relate to your users. The most important thing is to post on a regular basis.

Invented by Ahmed Adel, Engineer, in 2012, its patented technology is based on suspension bridge design. The Solabolic parabolic is designed to achieve the following goals: increasing the economic efficiency of concentrated solar power overcoming manufacturing, transport and size limits maximizing local content for developing economies Less costs and improvement for society and environment Using tensile forces with cost effective manufacturing processes, Solabolic achieves a precise parabolic shape required to focus the sun light. The heat produced can be used to power a steam turbine in order to generate electricity, or directly, to desalinate sea water for example. “Solabolic is not just a technology. It is a solution with many socio-economical and environmental aspects, such as food security, clean energy, job creation and clean water”, says Stefan Nolte, Financial Manager. The Startup can realize the industry’s largest dimensions with 20-30% less material. Its technology leads to a reduction cost by 35% in the solar field. One of its most important advantages: maximizing the utilization of local resources and manpower in the developing countries. Indeed, the production of the parabolic shape – achieved via physical principals – does not require complicated manufacturing processes. The Success-Story of Solabolic Ahmed Adel is the inventor and patent owner of the Solabolic technology. He started working on it in 2012, while being Research assistant at the Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Energy Systems and Thermo Dynamics. He was joined in the Solabolic adventure by Stefan Nolte as Financial Manager to further advance the project. Stefan has worked for fours years in Finance, Mergers & Acquisitions and did transactions in the Renewable Energy sector. He was interested in a new challenge and found Ahmed to make it happen. The Solabolic competitive advantages have been confirmed by the Vienna University of Technology. Ahmed and Stefan were awarded the ClimateLaunchpad Austria in 2015, the Europe’s Largest Cleantech Business Idea competition with over 700 teams from 28 countries, and were ranked among the top 7 start-ups in Europe. Solabolic was recently selected for the Climate-KIC accelerator and for receiving the AWS PreSeed government grants.

The explicit meaning of words is just one aspect of human communication. The implicit messages, whether intentional or not, which are expressed through non-verbal behaviours also belong to human communication. Nonverbal communications include facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, gestures displayed through body language and the physical distance between the communicators. Jeff Cabili, Expert of nonverbal communication, has some answers on how to use nonverbal communication sucessfully for your busines. Jeff Cabili, Expert in nonverbal communicationWhat is the essence of nonverbal communication and why is it important?NVC (nonverbal communication) in a business context accounts for at least 70% of the whole communication process. It comprises the movements, gestures and postures of the body (body language), the facial expressions as well as the use of the voice. It is important because it can reinforce, support or contradict the verbal message. When used properly with the verbal message, it can create a greater impact from the speaker upon the audience and keep the attendees captivated. What are the keys to effective nonverbal communication?The knowledge on which signals and nonverbal cues can reinforce the verbal message. A proper use of those and especially the avoidance of other signals which are not relevant will keep the interest and attention of the attendees. Nonverbal communication happens subconsciously: what are your tips to control it/improve it especially in situations people do not deal with every day. For instance during presentations or talking in front of a large audience. Some signals are sent unconsciously by the speaker when he/she is trying to deceive or to hide some information. They should not be present if the speaker knows his content and is “relaxed”. In cases of anxiety and nervousness, I suggest that he/she take: a deep breath, three times and slowly a brief physical exercise, such as climbing up/down the stairs for 5 min an auto suggestion of future success, such as talking to oneself in front of a mirror and convince whom you see that he/she is going to do a stellar lecture. Pitch presentation: you have 2 Minutes time to convince the investors not just about the business idea, but also about the fact that they are giving their money to the “right person”. What are your tipps to succeed in this situation? Know your content, talk briefly of the founders, use 3-5 slides for a 6 min presentation, explain why the idea will create a revolution and show enthusiasm.

Gegründet wurde soulbottles von Georg und Paul. Richtig los ging es mit einer Crowdfunding-Kampagne vor 2,5 Jahren. Mit Hilfe der Community hat soulbottles 2014 30.000 soulbottles verkauft. 2015 werden es wohl mehr als doppelt so viel werden. Um weiter zu wachsen – auch über den deutschsprachigen Raum hinaus, suchen die beiden Hubber nach Investoren.

Indeed, there is nothing compared to a freshly baked cake made by a granny and savoured in a 60-70’s atmosphere. At the Vollpension, pensioners prepare meals and desserts served by young people. It is a place where generations meet, share stories and life experiences. Through events such as storytelling evening and knitting workshop, the coffeehouse creates an attention towards intergenerational topics. “Giving older people the chance to earn some money next to their pensions is also a social impact we are proud of”, says David Haller. Today, around 25 people work at the Vollpension, including 15 grannies and grandpas, from Tuesday to Sunday. The recruitment process is easy. The grannies come either by word of mouth or after a visit. The only criteria to be part of the team: being at least 55 years old, loving the contact with young people and, of course, having certain baking skills. Vollpension coffeehouse visitors are not the only ones to savour the grannies’recipes. Every Wednesday, a Vollpension granny is cooking at Impact Hub Vienna.“The Hubbers love our grannies, like everybody else”, concludes David Haller.

They were created in 2008 – since 2009 they are available – but especially this summer, Lemonaid und ChariTea were “the drinks to enjoy”. Not only because they taste great, but also because the idea of helping social projects witch each bottle you buy, is a very pleasant one. It all started in a kitchen in Hamburg, when Paul Bethke, Jakob Berndt and Felix Langgeht mixed lime-juice, cane sugar, sparkling water and different other ingredients, until they found the perfect lemonade. After their home-production got inefficient, Lemonaid is now produced in collaboration with a local organic farmer and aims to do more than quenching our thirst. The name says it all: LemonAID helps ! Each bottle aims to contribute to social change and to make the world a better place through one of our human needs – drinking. With each sip of Lemonade you support fair trade and the Lemonaid & ChariTea e.V. which promotes different development projects. Good taste and social engagement don’t know any season! At Impact Hub Vienna, Lemonaid and ChariTea are the refreshment-drinks N°1. Yet, as it got colder outside, and winter arrived, I had to observe that the bottles where switched to mugs filled with hot tea and coffee. “What a Pitty!” I thought. “They are still delicious – and those projects need our support in winter-time as much as in any other season of the year!” This is how i came up with the idea of creating a wintery HOT Lemonaid, inspired by its original ingredients, the ones used for punch and my fantasy. The result is a totally new Lemonaid experience. Warming, if it is enjoyed hot – refreshing as it is carbonated – yet with a fruity and sweet counterpart. Try it out – be astonished – enjoy and save the world ! HOT LemonAID Ingredients for 4 glasses / mugs 0,5 L orange juice 1 orange 1 blood orange 1 grapefruit 1 lemon 2 TS coconut sugar 1 EL punch spices 2 x LEMONAID blood orange PREPARATION Half the citric fruits.

Ein „Muss-Event“ für Wiener Sozialunternehmer und die, die es noch werden wollen. 2016 wird der größte Studentenwettbewerb für soziales Unternehmertum in Österreich bereits zum achten Mal ausgetragen. Was genau der Social Impact Award eigentlich ist und wie er vielleicht auch dich bei der Umsetzung deiner Idee unterstützen kann, das verrate ich dir heute. (Eine Bildergalerie ist am Ende des Artikel zu finden) DER SOCIAL IMPACT AWARD Immer mehr Studenten stellen sich nicht mehr die Frage, welchen Beruf sie ausüben wollen, sondern welches Problem sie Lösen wollen.Eine neue Herangehensweise an die *Arbeitswelt*. Der geeignete Arbeitsplatz wird nicht mehr gesucht sondern erschaffen – oftmals in Eigenregie. Beim Kick-off Event des SIA konnten alle Interessierten erfahren, wie sie der SIA auf diesem Weg unterstützen kann und in direkten Kontakt mit erfolgreichen Sozialunternehmern wie Gabriela Sonnleitner vom Magdas Hotel, Hannah Lux, Geschäftsführerin der Vollpension, Bernhard Hofer von Talentify oder Moriz Piffl-Percevic, einer der Gebrüder Stitch treten. WAS IST DER *SOCIAL IMPACT AWARD* ? An dieser Stelle lasse ich ein Video für sich sprechen. Es erklärt nämlich sehr gut und genau, was der SIA ist – was er (für dich) tut – und welches Ziel er verfolgt. Peter Vandor, Gründer des SIA – Competence Center for Non Profit Organizations and Social Entrepreneurship, beschrieb uns, was den SIA so besonders macht. Kurz gesagt unterstützt der SIA Studierende, unternehmerisches Denken mit sozialem Handeln zu verbinden. Die besten 10 Projektideen bekommen Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung und erhalten ein kostenloses Inkubationsprogrammund. Die 5 besten Projekte werden zusätzlich ausgezeichnet und erhalten 3.000 € (4 Jury Awards) bzw. 2.000 € (Community Award) sowie zusätzliche Unterstützung. Wer den gesamten Prozess durchläuft hat es geschafft und ist einer der Gewinner des SIA. WER STEHT HINTER DEM SIA? Impact Hub Vienna Team + Volunteer Team + Unsere Partner Gegründet wurde der Social Impact Award im Jahr 2009 von der WU Wien und seit dem koordiniert vom Team des Impact Hub Vienna. Der Award findet 2016 in insgesamt 11 Ländern statt und erstreckt sich dabei vom europäischen bis zum asiatischen Raum. Soziale Projekte wie diese sind zumeist auf die Unterstützung von Partnern angewiesen. In der Erste Stiftung hat der Social Impact Award einen langjährigen Partner gefunden, der den sozialen Blickwinkel teilt. Franz Karl Prüller – von der Erste Stiftung sieht im Social Impact Award ein sogenanntes *window of opportunities* also Fenster der Möglichkeiten – und einen Weg, de Gesellschaft vor einem Crash zu bewahren. Auch beschreibt er Soziales Unternehmertum als „das Sinnvollste das man für die Gesellschaft tun kann!“ Wenn nicht heute, wann dann ? WAS PASSIERT 2016 ? Auch dieses Jahr bietet der SIA ein ganzjähriges Bildungsprogramm an. Dieses begann mit dem Kick-off Event am 14. Januar. Am 27.4. ist die Einreich-Frist für dein Projekt. Bis Ende Februar hast du Zeit erste Ideen und Gedanken zu sammeln, dann beginnen die sogenanntenGet Started Veranstaltungen, die zur Ideen Entwicklung beitragen sollen.Get Concrete Workshops gehen dann schon genauer auf deine Ideen ein und beinhalten sowohl eine Inspiration Tour als auch eine Action Tour. Voraussetzung um am Award teilnehmen zu können ist es, Studierender in Österreich zu sein. Nachdem beim Event alle Informationen an uns gegeben wurden, die ich gerade so schön in Worte verpackt an dich gerichtet habe, ging der Abend in einen offenen Austausch über, bei dem man sich mit anderen Interessierten sowie erfolgreichen Unternehmen austauschen und vernetzen konnte. An einzelnen Tischen entstanden offene Gespräche, denen mann kurz beiwohnen konnte, nur um dann den Tisch sowie Gesprächspartner und Themen zu wechseln. Ein gelungenes Ende der Veranstaltung bot das feine Essen von Deli Bluem begleitet von ganz vielen Pona Getränken, bei dem noch lange geredet, diskutiert und gegenseitig inspiriert wurde. Auch ich empfand das Event als sehr gelungen und vor allem inspirierend. Die vielen Beispiel-Unternehmen machen einmal mehr Mut. Sie beweisen, dass alles schaffbar ist, wenn man nur daran glaubt.

Das Studium der Wirtschaftsinformatik hat ihn nach Wien geführt. Mit 24 Jahren, unmittelbar nach dem Studium hat Thomas schon seine erste Firma mobile nachhilfe eine Nachhilfelehrer-Vermittlungsplattform, erfolgreich aufgebaut. Seit 2008 ist er zusätzlich im Bereich Online Marketing tätig. Seine Leidenschaft Sport kombiniert Thomas mit der Leidenschaft neue Projekte in die Welt zu rufen und umzusetzen hat ihn dazu bewogen eine sinnstiftende Organisation, namens SOCIAL FRIENDS, zur Förderung von jungen Behindertensportlern zu gründen. SOCIAL FRIENDS wurde 2014 Social Impact Award Sieger. SOCIAL FRIENDS fördert 8 junge österreichische behinderte Leistungssportler im PR Bereich und finanziert Projekte im Breitensport. Im Zuge des Projekts sind Events wie der SocialMan – Austrian Extreme Triathlon und ein Charity Run entstanden. Das Projekt erfährt immer mehr Zuspruch und darf sich mittlerweile über prominente Unterstützer wie z.B.: Marcel Hirscher, Mario Stecher, Peter Hackmair u.w. freuen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt dich an? Mich treibt eine unternehmerische Leidenschaft an, neue Ideen und Projekte umzusetzen, die es in dieser Form zuvor noch nicht gegeben hat. Es reizt mich ungemein in diesen Projekten neue Erfahrungen zu sammeln, Herausforderungen zu meistern und kreative Wege zum Projektziel zu suchen und zu finden. Wann hast du deine Leidenschaft für das was du gerade machst entdeckt? Wo hast du von dieser Idee erfahren? Die unternehmerische Leidenschaft war schon immer in mir. Mit 18 Jahren im Gymnasium wusste ich bereits, dass ich später einmal selbständig sein werde. Welche Projekte das tatsächlich sein werden, wusste ich allerdings noch nicht. Die SOCIAL FRIENDS Idee hat mich bei einem Radurlaub alleine auf Teneriffa gefunden. Eine Idee die mir emotional sehr nahe gegangen ist hat mir die Motivation und Energie für die Umsetzung gegeben. Wie hat deine Leidenschaft dein Leben verändert? Seit meinem Studium lebe ich meine Leidenschaft zu 100%. Das Wort Arbeit in dem Sinn gibt es für mich nicht mehr. Die „Arbeit“ ist zu meinem Leben geworden. Eine klassische Wochenteilung zwischen Wochenende und Arbeitswoche gibt es für mich nicht. Das Ausleben meiner Leidenschaft hat sich extrem positiv auf mich und meine persönliche Entwicklung ausgewirkt. Worauf verzichtest du um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Hmm. Eigentlich verzichte ich auf nichts. Wohin wird dich deine Leidenschaft noch bringen? Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass mich meine Leidenschaft noch sehr weit bringen wird. Sobald man die Leidenschaft einmal entdeckt hat und lebt merken alle rund um dich diesen speziellen Antrieb. Es geht einfach viel mehr weiter und man kann tatsächlich Unmögliches möglich machen. Durchs Ausleben der Leidenschaft werde ich persönlich noch sehr viel dazulernen und die Non-Profit Organisation weiter wachsen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei deiner Arbeit? Das schönste bei meiner „Arbeit“ ist, dass man sich selbstverwirklichen kann, dabei etwas Sinnvolles erschafft und andere Menschen davon profitieren. Also eine WIN WIN Situation. Wer sind deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Das ist vor allem mein Freundeskreis, der aus vielen unterschiedlichen Charakteren, Bildungsniveaus und Einkommensschichten besteht. Diese vermitteln mir in Gesprächen sehr unterschiedliche Sichtweisen aufs Projekt und wichtige Inputs, die für den Projekterfolg wichtig sind. Vom Kritiker, Motivator bis zum Träumer ist da alles dabei. Das ist für mich wichtig und gut so. Wer baut auf dich, wenn es einmal nicht so gut klappt? Meine Freundin, engster Freundeskreis und Familie. Wie gelingt es dir immer wieder Menschen für deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Die Leute spüren das Feuer, das in einem brennt. Es steckt an. Was sagen eigentlich deine Freunde, deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Viele sagen, dass es toll ist. Anfangs wird man sicherlich ein wenig belächelt und vielleicht auch sogar für verrückt erklärt. Aber das ist denke ich normal bis konkrete Ergebnisse und der Benefit zu sehen ist. Was andere darüber denken und sagen ist mir nicht so wichtig. Hast du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? 1. die eigene Leidenschaft entdecken 2. den Mut haben die eigene Leidenschaft mit viel Spaß und Durchhaltevermögen umzusetzen Was treibt dich an immer wieder neue Projekte zu starten? Sicherlich die Neugier etwas Neues zu machen und zu erschaffen. Nach einem erfolgreichen Projektabschluss suche ich mir neue Herausforderungen. Hast du einen Wunsch? Ja. SOCIAL FRIENDS soll eine international tätige Organisation werden, die viel bewegt und dabei viele junge behinderte Menschen unterstützt. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Unsere Leidenschaft <U+0001F609> Hast du für unsere Leser eine Buchempfehlung, einen webTipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Patz? Ich bin ganz und gar kein Bücherwurm. Dennoch kann ich eines empfehlen: „Träume verändern“ von Peter Hackmair. Peter erzählt davon wie sich Träume im Laufe des Lebens durch gewollte oder ungewollte Ereignisse verändern können. Spannend. Als inspirierenden Platz kann ich den Gipfel des Berges Teide auf Teneriffa empfehlen. Von dort aus hat man einen traumhaften Weitblick. Was ich sonst noch erzählen möchte? Für unsere Behindertensportler suchen wir ehrenamtliche Redakteure.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/02/25/design-thinking-with-ibm/","ImpactHub","Design Thinking with IBM","An overall customer driven strategy, customer intimacy and loyalty can make or break a startup in today’s world. 42% of start ups fail because they are not solving a market problem¹. Do you need more reasons to focus on the humans forming these markets? Design Thinking is a way to tackle problems by focusing on users’ needs and provides a tool for practical and creative problem solving. It is known for the ability to structure the way you approach situations and find efficient solutions. Design is understood as the “intent behind an outcome”² because innovation is never just scratching on the surface. If you are not familiar with Design Thinking we highly recommend you to watch this video by IBM: But how do you translate Design Thinking into specific action? We tackled this question in a workshop on customer and community engagement. The workshop was sponsored by IBM as part of a Social Media Strategy Planning grant they provided to Impact Hub Vienna. Hosted by Andra Muresanu, enthusiast for digital innovation and Klaus Kornfeld, UX Consultant from IBM, the workshop gave valuable insights on how human-centered design can help in developing innovative solutions. A number of Impact Hub Vienna Members participated in the workshop, they were joined by creative minds from the Accelerate Program, Social Impact Start and the Scaling Program. Here are some learnings from the workshop on Design Thinking: Learning 1: Always put the users’ needs in the center There are many ways to prioritize goals and there are even more ways to realize ideas. This is about putting your users’ need in the center of your actions. Use this approach as a frame and integrate it into your daily work structure, especially whenever your machines are standing still. Learning 2: Create buyer personas Some entrepreneurs have it, some don´t. Creating a buyer persona is a project without an external deadline, which means it is likely to just push it aside. In the swirl of everyday work it is easy to discuss hundreds of ideas and thoughts without creating a benefit for your work. A buyer persona gives your team a model of your target group. If you have to reconsider a thousand details and potential scenarios, you have to invest a lot of time and energy with every decision you make. The buyer persona, let´s call her Anna, helps you to stay focused and replaces an unspecific feeling for your target groups, with a fictional model costumer. Whenever you face decision it is easier for you and your team to ask yourself how to improve the situation for Anna instead of losing the creative momentum in a discussion about your target group. Learning 3: Know your data A good buyer persona is the base and reference system when setting your compass in costumer- and community oriented approaches. So the one big advice is: Analyse, analyse, analyse. It is no secret that the better you know your target groups, the better you can understand them. Don´t let quantitative data from facebook insights or google analytics be your only source for that. Invest some time! Talk to your users. Get a picture of what they are doing. Don´t forget: Everyone in your team knows one of your costumers in a different situation – a potential not to be wasted. How does Anna feel when she comes home from work? Is she looking for new opportunities in life? How old is she, where does she work, what attributes does she have? Is she sporty? Is she on instagram? Is she married? Does she have a pet? Which media does she consume? Paint a clear picture of a person. Empathy is key here. IBM presented the following dimensions to structure the personality of your buyer persona: What does she say? What does she think? What is she doing? How does she feel? Start with your most important target group and repeat this for every target group you can identify. Learning 4: Break it down! Define a time frame and break the journey of your buyer persona down into single steps and visualize them. How does she feel in this situation? What is she thinking? And what is she doing during every single step? Sure, there are multiple ways that lead to Rome for your costumer. Chose one. This will help you to identify tensions the user may have and enables you to improve. Learning 5: Identify your costumer’s pain points! Stay focused on the big problems and don´t lose yourself on features of the website or small improvements. The question to ask is:“What ideas are easy to implement and have the biggest impact on your business?” This could be a negative emotional situation for the user, a technological gap which stops Anna in her flow or just the (missing) knowledge about your product. Let your creative juices flow and use your collective brain power to develop ideas to tackle specific problems. Whenever you get stuck ion a problem or question, and this will happen, don´t let this stop you. You have to keep going, unfortunately there is no single question to ask when searching for a solution however “What matters most?“or “What is more efficient?“ are a good place to start. Choose the idea that is easy to implement and at the same time has the biggest impact on the pain points. There are no perfect solutions, so don´t waste your teams energy searching for it. Keep the momentum! A final word of advice… Put your smartphone and laptop away before you start. Grab a pen and paper. Not only does this add to a more communicative situation but also helps you stay focused. Buy tons of post-its and a whiteboard and it will change the way you work! With these learnings it will be much easier to design a costumer-centered strategy and assures you don’t miss their needs.

That’s why we challegend ‘Dwarfs and Giants’ at their office at Impact Hub Vienna to predict the future of business. In the end, we learned that we might not want to predict the future after all. Why? We’ll, let ‘Dwarfs and Giants’ explain that to you. What is the founding story of ‘Dwarfs and Giants? Sascha Bernardis: “Four consultants decided to leave their old company to experience new ways of organizing, that was the beginning of Dwarfs and Giants. One of the most important ideas in the beginning was how to become unimportant for the company as a founder. Normally founders are very important especially for a Start Up. But we were thrilled by the idea to become in the most effective way unimportant. That’s why we said: let’s go with Holacracy, because then we do not delegate but distribute authority and let’s do a purpose quest to find the purpose we want to bring together to the world. Our purpose is rewriting the future of organisation and catalyzing the evolution of wholesome organisations. So that’s what we do today!” How are you prototyping the future of business? What is the change you want to make? Christiane Seuhs-Schoeller: “We are supporting the shift towards wholesome organisations, meaning that people who work in an organisation can truly show up whole and therefore develop their entire and full potential in order to contribute to something that is bigger than themselves – which is the purpose of on organisation. It’s about having purpose driven organisations to do what is important for the world.” What is the one thing that helps you prepare for the future? Tell us about Impact Hub Vienna and how it has impacted your enterprise. What is ‘Holacracy’? What are the benefits of ‘Holacracy’? Christiane Seuhs-Schoeller: “Over the course of the last decade, especially after 2008/2009 there has been visible and dramatically increasing amount of people disconnected with what they do: loneliness, sicknesses, depression and burn-out, coming from the feeling that work is senseless and has a lack of identification is the result. Apparently there is a general shift of consciousness happening, starting in some societies of the world. And if we look for example at Frederic Laloux’s book of “Reinventing Organizations” we can clearly read how with every conscious shift in society organisations shift along with it, because it needs a new form of organising. That is where ‘Holacracy’ comes in as one form of organising. Until now, it is the only one that is scalable across almost every organisation that is willing to go through that shift. Because of the purpose driven mode that you need, the clear goal is to align everything in the organisation to the purpose. That really makes a complete difference for people because they then have a different sense of identification and sense in what they’re doing, by aligning to the purpose of the organisation. Through the purpose the organisation is anchored in society, because the purpose is the answer to what the society wants the organisation to be and the organisation answers the question ‘what do I want to be in society?’. That’s why we believe, in the not so distant future every business needs to be purpose driven and therefore socially responsible.” What advice would you give to someone to help them achieve their dreams?","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/next-land-MAP_front-600x400.jpeg","March 2, 2016","en",0.995146870613098,0.000203828240046278,0.881505191326141,0.0557615607976913,0.0625293627381325

Every business should be affected by the future of business, but Start Ups and Social Entrepreneurs as role models in this field encounter various difficulties, but also benefit from being a strongly connected community. We asked our members at Impact Hub Vienna how they deal with change and what they contribute to the future of business. Nikolaus Hutter- New Paradigm Ventures and Angello “The future of business is … a new economic paradigm of how we produce, consume, work… generally, how we organise the allocation of our resources. It permeates all levels – the why, the what and the how. Business purpose (the why) will change from narrow focus for the few (profit maximisation for shareholders) to broader purpose for many (maximising impact – and well-being – for all stakeholders). This will result in a shift towards products and services that satisfy genuine needs, rather than create ever-new wants (the what): These will be offered by organisations whose mode of operation is in line with – rather than at the expense of – what we value in life (the how): harmony with others and nature, a shared purpose greater than our individual selves, collaboration with others resulting in meaningful relationships, and the possibility to grow and fulfil our potential.” What is the change you want to make? “My goal is to help create an economic model so that the terms social entrepreneur and impact investor are as pleonastically redundant as the adjectives in “dark night”, “cold ice”, “wet water “etc. In the future, there will only be entrepreneurs and investors, who either create value – financial, social, and environmental – or go out of business.” In your personal routines and habits what is one thing that helps you prepare for the future? “Apart from the obvious like a daily 2hr morning meditation, barefoot runs in the Vienna Woods, eating a gluten-and lactose-free paleo diet, and keeping up with the latest sustainability and mindfulness research, I just try and enjoy whatever I do – in my honest opinion a key part in living the new how in the here-and-now.” Ana Barros- Instagram Influencer and Co- Founder of Better How will the future of business look like? “Thinking of businesses as they are today, most still depend on hierarchical structures. I believe that there will be no bosses in the future and we can all be freelancers.” Sebastian Rahs and Rainer Wachter- Woodsaw As a business, how are you prototyping the future of business?“By inventing new combined professions.” In your personal routines and habits, what is one thing that helps you prepare for the future?“To extend our skills in all directions.” The future of business is…versatility.” Simon Schmitz- Awattar How do you see the future of business?“The future of business lies in what we need most as a society: justice and a healthy natural environment. To avoid dangerous climate change, we need to sync our energy use with nature. The tools are there (like software). So are the obstacles (such as grown institutions). And business will always be about getting the job done to overcome them.” Anna Iarotska- Robo Wunderkind As a business, how are you prototyping the future of business? “One thing that is going to shape the future of entrepreneurship is impermanence and constant reconfiguration. Change is unavoidable and happening at a fast pace. I believe it is crucial for every business to stay flexible and adapt to those developments. What has been always very helpful for our Robo Wunderkind team: we have a very mixed skill set. We are all coming from different backgrounds and bring in different perspectives. A constant reconfiguration of skills and teams, assembled according to the different tasks is the key.” Isabella Scholl and Arnold Hoffmann- Erntehilfe What is the change you want to make? “Every business and project evolves from the motivation to change and improve something. We want to set signs for a good working-together philosophy and create transparency and fairness in different branches were employers, employees and customer groups come together. The future of business is… the combination of constant learning, developing and sharing!” ","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_9725-600x400.jpg","March 2, 2016","en",0.992730379104614,4.34405847045127e-05,0.890360891819,0.000187606317922473,0.109408132731915

Er hatte das Glück, seine ersten beruflichen Sporen bei einem sehr erfolgreichen Start Up zu verdienen. Dessen Wachstum von null auf 40 % Marktanteil war für Martin eine sehr interessante und prägende Zeit die verdeutlichte, was ein engagiertes Team alles erreichen kann. In den darauffolgenden Jahren konnte Martin Wesian in Südamerika und Asien als Rucksacktourist, Restaurantbetreiber und Tauchlehrer den Unterschied zwischen Arm und Reich hautnah miterleben. Schlussendlich arbeitete er mehrere Jahre in Wien im Kunst- Kulturbereich, quasi der Gegenpol von Armut. HELIOZ versucht nun die Diskrepanz zwischen Arm und Reich zumindest im Kleinen zu schliessen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt dich an? Veränderung, Verbesserung, Wandel. Der Status Quo ist meist nicht akzeptabel oder zumindest verbesserungswürdig. Wann hast du die Ideen für HELIOZ für dich entdeckt? Der Keim dazu wurde wohl durch meine Erkrankung an Cholera in Südamerika gepflanzt. Ich habe innerhalb von 2 Wochen über 15 kg an Gewicht verloren, was ich als wohlgenährter Europäer relativ gut wegstecken konnte. Wenn Kinder 20% ihres Gewichts verlieren, schaut die Sache wiederum ganz anders aus. Prägend war, dass ich mir während meiner Cholera Erkrankung einen Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung ermöglichen konnte, welche meinen Freunden vor Ort nicht möglich war. Die Diskrepanz zwischen der lokalen Bevölkerung und meinem privilegierten Zugang als Europäer ist mir damals erst richtig bewusst geworden. Alleine durch den Vorteil meines Geburtsortes standen mir Möglichkeiten offen, die den Menschen vor Ort verwehrt waren. Warum gerade dieses Projekt? Es kann doch einfach nicht sein, dass in unserer hochtechnologisierten Welt die Ärmsten der Armen immer noch wegen verschmutzen Wasser sterben. Es sterben mehr Kinder durch wasserbedingte Durchfallerkrankungen, als an Malaria, AIDS und Masern zusammen. Unfassbare 2000 Kinder pro Tag. Während zur Lösung von Malaria und AIDS Unsummen investiert werden, gibt es kaum Innovationen für einfach zu vermeidende Infektionen, die durch Wasser hervorgerufen werden. Deshalb: Althergebrachte Lösungen wie Abkochen, Chlor und Filter konnten das Problem in den letzten 50 Jahren nicht zum Besseren wenden und sie passen auch nicht zu den Bedürfnissen und Möglichkeiten der Menschen. Eine neue, disruptive Lösung ist notwendig. Wo findest du den Raum um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In Gesprächen, in meinem Kopf, im Austausch mit dem Team und in unseren Projekten. Worauf verzichtest du, um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Leider gehört die Reduzierung von Freizeit, sozialen Kontakten, Sport und Kultur zum Ausleben solch einer Leidenschaft dazu. Ein Schicksal, welches aber wohl den meisten Gründern bekannt ist, unabhängig der Art des Start ups. Persönlicher Einsatz ist notwendig, macht aber auch Spass und kann auch erfüllend sein. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei deiner Arbeit? Die schönsten Momente erlebe ich während den Aufenthalten in unseren Zielländern. Der Austausch mit den Menschen in Afrika oder Asien und deren Probleme, aber auch vor allem deren (Lebens-) Weisheiten und Lebensfreude sind immer wieder beeindruckend. Wer sind deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Nicht notwendigerweise in dieser Reihenfolge bzw. wechselnd: Sohn, Team, Investoren, Kunden, Freunde. Wer baut dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Am besten abschalten kann ich wenn ich mit meinem 3 jährigen Kleinen unterwegs bin, da ihn meine alltäglichen Probleme nicht interessieren. Er beschäftigt sich mit der Entdeckung seiner Welt – und er nimmt mich jedes Mal mit auf seine Entdeckungsreise. Wohin wird dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Wohin mich persönlich diese Arbeit bringt, wird sich noch zeigen. Entweder ende ich als Sozialfall, oder als Mitarbeiter eines sehr coolen Unternehmens, welches sich den dringendsten Problemen der Welt annimmt und leistbare Lösungen dafür entwickelt. Viel interessanter ist aber die Frage, wohin die Arbeit von HELIOZ führen wird? HELIOZ wird in der Branche bereits jetzt als Know how Träger und gewichtiger Player wahrgenommen. Nun gilt es, dass Ganze in ein ökonomisch gut funktionierendes Modell zu überführen, um eine Teilnahme am internationalen Diskurs auch finanziell tragen zu können. Was würdest du machen, wenn es Helioz nicht geben würde? Ich hätte vermutlich meine vorherige Tätigkeit im Kunst- Kulturmanagement weitergeführt, jedoch unterbrochen durch Einsätze im Bereich der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit. Im Jahr 2010 hatte ich ein Wochenende, in dem ich vor der Entscheidung stand HELIOZ zu gründen, oder einen Einsatz für Ärzte ohne Grenzen zu absolvieren. Letzteres hätte mich sehr gereizt und mir auch einiges an Know how allgemein und für die heutige Arbeit vermittelt. Nach einem Wochenende mit wenig Schlaf ist es doch HELIOZ geworden <U+0001F609> Gibt es bestimmte Themen die dich besonders interessieren? Politik, soziale Ungerechtigkeit, Kunst&Kultur. Wie gelingt es dir immer wieder Menschen für deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Keine Ahnung! Ich weiss auch nicht ob ich begeistern kann, oder ob es das WADI ist. Ich reflektiere und präsentiere meine Erfahrungen sowie meine tiefe Überzeugung, dass eine bessere Welt möglich ist. Aber Hauptsache es begeistert und bringt die Sache vorwärts. Was sagen eigentlich deine Freunde, dein Umfeld, deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Super; Such dir einen gscheiten Job; Mach weiter so; Warum hast du nie Zeit?; … Hast du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ob ich den LeserInnen Tipps geben kann sei dahingestellt, aber zwei Sachen habe ich von HELIOZ gelernt: 1. Gerade wir inMitteleuropa sollten uns öfter vor Augen führen, in welch privilegierten Umfeld wir geboren wurden. Nicht die Angst vor einer Verschlechterung unserer Lebenssituation sollte uns antreiben, sondern die Verbesserung der Lebenssituation anderer sollte unser Ziel sein. 2. Ich glaube jede und jeder kann GründerIn sein bzw. ist es bereits. Wer hat sich noch nicht über Produkte, Lösungen oder Dienstleistungen geärgert, weil sie unpraktisch waren oder schlicht fehlten? Der einzige Schritt zum Gründen ist es an sich zu glauben und die bessere oder neue Lösung zu etablieren. Ein Versuch ist es immer Wert, scheitern ist nur eine Alternative. Hast du einen Wunsch? Allgemein wäre es schön zu sehen, wenn der Fokus auf den eigenen Vorteil nicht im Vordergrund stehen würde, da er meist nur zu Lasten anderer möglich ist. Kant hat es am treffendsten formuliert: “Handle nur nach derjenigen Maxime, durch die du zugleich wollen kannst, dass sie ein allgemeines Gesetz werde”. www.helioz.org","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HELIOZ_MartinWesian_02-600x400.jpg","March 7, 2016","de",0.998956620693207,0.00116102281026542,0.667784780263901,0.0435429505887441,0.287511229515076

Zum Studieren ist er nach Wien gekommen und picken geblieben. Stefan mag Berge, Cafés und ab und zu ein Wiener Schnitzel. Und mit FragNebenan baut er sich gerade das Unternehmen auf, in dem er schon immer arbeiten wollte. FragNebenan ist ein soziales Netzwerk für Nachbarinnen und Nachbarn. Es geht darum miteinander in Kontakt zu kommen, sich auszutauschen und Nachbarschaftshilfe zu organisieren. Es soll dazu beitragen, dass Nachbarschaft zu einer Gemeinschaft wird. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Ich möchte etwas Sinnvolles tun. Meine Zeit, meine Energie, mein Geld in Etwas investieren, an das ich glaube. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für dieses Projekt entdeckt? Vor etwa zweieinhalb Jahren. Ich hatte gerade meinen alten Job aufgegeben. Eine längere Reise hinter mir. Eine Brandeins-Ausgabe über die Sharing Economy gelesen. Und bei einer Wanderung mit einem Kumpel länger darüber geredet, dass es cool wäre, im Freundeskreis eine Art Verleihkreis aufzubauen. Passiert ist es dann aber in meinem Stiegenhaus. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Ich hatte wieder mal nur „Hallo“ zu einem meiner Nachbarn gesagt. Und mir gedacht, dass es seltsam ist, dass wir zwar unter einem Dach wohnen – uns aber überhaupt nicht kennen. Und warum ist es dann FragNebenan geworden? Weil sich hier der Verleihkreis und das Gefühl, dass man in der Nachbarschaft auch anders zusammenleben könnte, für mich verbunden haben. Und je länger ich über die Idee nachgedacht habe, desto klarer ist mir geworden, dass in der Nachbarschaft ein riesiges Potenzial steckt, uns den Alltag einfacher zu machen und uns mehr zu Hause zu fühlen. Und dass dieses Potenzial nur in ganz seltenen Fällen genutzt wird. Was würdest Du eigentlich tun, wenn es FragNebenan nicht geben würde? Ich wollte immer im Medienbereich arbeiten. Für ein Medium, das richtigen Journalismus macht. Und dass ich selber gerne lese. Ich war auch gerade am Bewerbungsschreiben schreiben als ich begann, über FragNebenan nachzudenken. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Auf der Welt haben wir noch nicht all zu viele Spuren hinterlassen. Aber wir arbeiten dran. In Wien würden uns aber glaub ich schon einige Nachbarinnen und Nachbarn vermissen. Und darauf sind wir ziemlich stolz. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In unserem Büro. Bei Nachbarschaftstreffen. In einem meiner Lieblingscafés. Bei den vielen Gesprächen, die sich ergeben, seit sich das mit FragNebenan ergeben hat. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Früher war ich öfter in den Bergen. Meine Freunde hab ich auch öfter gesehen. Länger verreisen war auch schon einmal einfacher als heute <U+0001F609> Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das wir mit Menschen zu tun haben. Aus allen Altersgruppen. Mit den unterschiedlichsten Berufen. Und jeder Menge Geschichten. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Andreas, Mathias und Valentin. Wir haben FragNebenan von Anfang an gemeinsam aufgebaut. Und haben auch alle Rückschläge gemeinsam weggesteckt. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir wollen FragNebenan bald in andere Städte und Länder bringen. Damit werden wir ein Zeiterl zu tun haben. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Hab das Gefühl, dass ich damit wenig zu tun habe. Es ist eher die Idee, die die Leute begeistert. Weil in ihr so viele Möglichkeiten stecken, den Alltag leichter und das Zusammenleben schöner zu machen. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Soweit ich das mitbekomme sind alle sehr stolz auf das, was wir aufgebaut haben. Und mittlerweile glaubt auch meine 82-jährige Oma daran, dass aus FragNebenan etwas werden kann. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Podcast hören.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/03/10/world-cafe-with-anna-wohlesser/","ImpactHub","World Café with Anna Wohlesser","How to get 150 people talking As a facilitator and process designer I regularly work with large groups during workshops/conferences or similar events. Creating interactive and meaningful and not too long and motivating and effective settings with 150 or more people in the room is often required and can be a challenge due to time requirements, participants that don’t know each other… World Café is one of the methodologies I often go back to in this case, as it allows for exploring a topic openly, from many different angles in a relatively safe setting with a certain timeframe. So how does it work? For a World Café, participants sit in small groups, often around tables that have paper or flipchart “tablecloths” with markers lying on them. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, which can even be supported by coffee and drinks being available and/or served during the process. Participants are invited to explore and exchange thoughts on a given topic or question over several rounds following a certain “Café Etiquette” that encourages active listening, speaking the essence and doodling on the paper tablecloths in front of them so as to document the thought process of the group. One person is the “table host” and his/her role is to moderate the discussion if necessary and encourage people who are rather quiet to contribute. After every round the “table host” stays on the table while the others switch and find a new group to explore further. The ”table host” gives the newcomers a short summary of the previous discussion on the start of the next round. This allows for the newly formed group to build on the insights of the previous round thus enabling a deepening of the dialog while simultaneously understanding again new and different perspectives. The last step in a World Café is to bring together the main insights from each table and share them with the whole group. And where can this be used? I have seen World Cafes in small traditional Tyrolean mountain huts with 20 people, on a conference with 150 economic researchers as well as 500 people sitting on a town square in Cluj, Romania. It is a versatile and effective format that really allows for the collective interests and ideas of the group to emerge.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/F1w3O7q5nUBtNtiRZ-J22ewPgxA6SbZDf78WKc53smY-600x400.jpeg","March 10, 2016","en",0.994548439979553,0.00130924966651946,0.617826521396637,0.00150837341789156,0.379355907440186
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/03/11/optimizing-your-day-2-day-life-with-matthias-reisinger/","ImpactHub","Optimizing your Day 2 Day life with Matthias Reisinger","Optimizing your Day 2 Day life with Matthias Reisinger This months skill share breakfast saw Matthias Reisinger, Co-founder & Director of the Impact Hub Vienna and efficiency guru, sharing some of his personal tips, tricks and apps that he uses every day. The event was very popular, and had to be expanded to deal with the increased interest. The event saw Matthias deliver some very valuable knowledge on how to integrate apps and shortcuts into one’s daily working life. This blog post will recap some of the apps he covered in the event. The apps he covered: Evernote Evernote is a cross-platform app designed to organise and structure your notes, to do lists, reminders and more. Matthias emphasized that it is key to fully commit to using Evernote for everything. Once you have fully committed to using it will make everything more simple by storing everything in one place. The next step is to work out how you want to structure your work. As Matthias has lots of different roles with Impact Hub Vienna he structures it in such a way that groups his work together. So when he is working in one role he can find all the information and to do lists that are associated with that role. Another clever trick Matthias demonstrated is the linking of other notes within Evernote. This linking process simplifies the work flow and makes it easier to connect one note to another, meaning you never waste time searching for notes, this helps you reach a ‘flow state’ as you quickly move from one task to another. Note link can be achieved in the Evernote app on your computer by right clicking a note, on the web version this function can be found at the top of the note. This link can be added to other locations, such as calendar, email, to do lists etc, helping you streamline your working process in all locations. Price: Evernote Basic is free, Plus is €19.99 per year and Premium is €39.99 per year. More information can be found here. OmniFocus OmniFocus is a very powerful task management tool based on the principles of ‘Getting things done‘. Matthias highlights numerous features of OmniFocus that he uses every day. It gives you the ability to add tasks from anywhere on your computer using a quick shortcut, be that from an email, a webpage or somewhere else. It simplifies the task adding process by automatically filing certain fields, for example the title of an email becomes the title of the task and the highlighted text becomes the content. It also includes an automatic link to the URL so you can go directly to the email or anywhere else when you need it. Another benefit of OmniFocus is that is it lets you view your work in a number of ways, or ‘perspectives’. Matthias highlights that this can be used to allocate tasks to specific locations or scenarios, For example when you are at work, at home or connected to the internet. Omni Focus then displays the tasks that are relevent to your current situation. This makes it easier to shift focus and only work on the tasks that relevent at that time. On top of this with the OmniFocus app you will be notified, via Location Settings, to which location you are near and there which tasks you can complete.OmniFocus also has a built in review tool, this enables a task to be scheduled for a later date. Meaning it will show you the tasks that are the most urgent, and will schedule others for later. Overall OmniFocus is a great tool to help you focus on the most important task at hand, taking into account your current location and situation. It really can help you streamline your working life as you always know what the next task is as it helps you prioritise your work. More information can be found here. MailPlane MailPlane is an app for mac which hosts your gmail account in a separate window to your browsers. Matthias explained a number of benefits of using MailPlane. Its main benefit is how it can link with other apps. As it operates using Apples default code language it is easy to integrate it with OmniFocus or other apps such as Alfred. This can help you streamline your working processes using short cuts meaning you can find emails, create tasks and work more efficiently. More information can be found here. TextExpander This tool drew a lot of interest from the attendees of the breakfast. Matthias demonstrated how this tool can save you time and make you faster and more efficient when answering emails, typing text and more. Text expander takes short cuts that you predefine and writes full texts for you. The example Matthias used was writing the address of Impact Hub Vienna. Impact Hub Vienna Lindengasse 56 1070 Wien Austria Now this doesn’t seem to take so long, however if you have to write this out 10 times a day the time adds up. The short cut Matthias uses? ;ihadd. Then the app does the hard work for you. The app also allows the use of drop downs and editable text with in short cut. Another example Matthias used was writing the description of Impact Hub Vienna. As this is text he often has to write, and he needs to meet the brand image as it is important there is consistency with this message. Also at times there is a requirement for a long, short or very short description, depending on the intended use for the text. TextExpander gives you flexibility to select which description you want. When Matthias types ;ihdescrip a pop up comes up like the one shown here. Then you just have to select which version of the text you want. This not only saves time as you don’t have to find the text and copy and paste it, but it ensures you are consistent in your message. Another powerful customisation possible in TextExpander is the ability to customise a pre-written text using drop downs, input text fields or optional extra text segments, such as inviting someone for coffee. Functions which can be seen in the image. On top of all of this the app will recommend certain chunks of text for snippeting, meaning if you type something frequently the app will realise and actually recommend you develop a short cut for it. Find out more here. Alfred Alfred is another app for Mac. This app replaces and far surpasses the built in Spotlight search function that is built into every Mac product. This app performs everything the Spotlight does, searching your Mac and searching documents with in your Mac, however Matthias highlights that it is what Alfred does extra that really makes it a must have app for example being apple to complete calculations. With the premium version it becomes much more powerful. It has the ability to launch programs, search specific websites, play music and much, much more. But what makes Alfred so great is that all this is performed with hotkeys and text. Making it very fast an efficient to use. More can be found here. Contactually Contactually is a great app for monitoring and maintaining important relationships, both in business and personally. By categorising your contacts into buckets (groups of similar contacts), you enable Contactually to take care of the rest. It will remind you when to follow up, how any prior interactions went, or what to say to break the ice. With regular follow-up like this, you’ll soon realise you have fewer forgotten connections, and more engaged relationships. Find out more here. 1Password Matthias asked the attendees of the event ‘Do you have one password for everything?’ They answer ‘yes’ Matthias then asked ‘Is it secure?’ The answer to this is obviously no. If one account gets hacked they are all open for the Hackers. So the safe thing is to use different and complex passwords for everything, but then you have the challenge to remember them all. 1Password aims to solve this problem. It is a secure, encrypted location for all of you passwords. You just have to remember one key password, which will allow access to all of the others. Your passwords are, encrypted, password protected and stored locally on your laptop, so no need to worry about someone hacking them in The Cloud. 1Password integrates into your browser making it simple and easy to use. You just have to remember that one password to have access to all your passwords to all your accounts. Find out more here. Matthias covered a lot in the short time he had but there were a number of apps he wanted to talk about but didn’t have time to cover in full. Here is a summary of the apps he didn’t get time to cover and the key points of each one. Fantastical Fantastical is a Calendar app for Mac which allows you to schedule meetings, events and reminders using natural language, meaning you can write ‘Lunch at 4 tomorrow with Mike’ and it will translate that into a calendar appointment. It automatically recognises locations and can send invites to your contacts. Naturally it integrates with most existing calendar apps and it places a widget on your Apple Widget Screen. Find out more here. Flycut Enables you to copy and paste up to 40 snippets. Its saves them in a tool in your task bar. It is a open source product based on ‘JumpCut’. This open source model makes it free and customisable. This tool means you can copy and paste lots of different pieces of information without fear of losing something you copied earlier. Find out more here. FullContact FullContact is a contact management tool, offering both a free and a paid version. It gives you the ability to manage you contacts in a simplified yet more detailed way. With the premium account you can photograph a business card, which will be transcribed by a person, ensuring no computer error, and then entered into your contacts. It finds public information on people and collects it all in one place and it can create contacts from email signatures, saving you time and effort. Find out more here. Whats App for Web Whats App for Web allows you to access your Whats App from your phone via your Laptop. For this to work you need to have Whats App installed on your phone and attached to the internet. This simplifies communication because you can do it all from one device, your laptop, and not have to keep switching between phone and laptop. Find out more here.

Matthias rounded up his presentation by summarising the key points when using new programs, short cuts or widgets. ‘It is important to remain patient and ensure all shortcuts and tools are customised to your style of work.’ By knowing how you work before trying to incorporate new tools, shortcuts or widgets, you can customise your tools to get the best out of them. He also emphasized the importance of integrating new tools gradually, this way you really get to know how they work and what they are good for. If you install everything on this list at once the likelihood is you won’t use all of them because you will be overwhelmed. His advice was to take it slow and really get to know how the tools work so you can get the best out of them.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stressed-with-text-2-600x400.jpg","March 11, 2016","en",0.990057408809662,0.0296177964046365,0.472708165645599,0.0204236887899848,0.477250317732493
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/03/13/perrine-schober-das-soziale-ist-meine-welt/","ImpactHub","Perrine Schober: “Das Soziale ist meine Welt”","Perrine Schober ist 32 Jahre alt. Sie ist halb Französin und halb Österreicherin und hat Tourismus Management in Deutschland studiert. Während ihres Erasmus-Semesters in England hat sie sich auf “Tourismus als volkswirtschaftliches Instrument der Armutsverringerung” spezialisiert und anschließend für unterschiedliche Entwicklungshilfeorganisationen im Ausland gearbeitet. SHADES TOURS ist ein Hybrid zwischen der Sozialwirtschaft und dem Tourismus, es ist ein Social Tourism Business. SHADES TOURS bietet obdachlosen Menschen eine wertschätzende Beschäftigung an, die sie motiviert aktiv an der Gesellschaft und am Arbeitsmarkt teilzunehmen. Es werden dazu Touren zu den unterschiedlichen Wiener Sozialeinrichtungen für Obdachlose angeboten. Das besondere hierbei ist, dass diese selbst von Obdachlosen und EinrichtungsleiterInnen geführt werden. Perrine, wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für „SHADES TOURS” entdeckt? Im Jahr 2014 habe ich meinen Job gekündigt. Ich spürte einen grundlegenden Motivationsverlust und eine kleine Lebenskrise. Ich habe eines Tages einen Persönlichkeitstest zugeschickt bekommen, den 16personalities.com-Test, welcher auf C.G. Jung basiert. Heraus kam, in der Rubrik “Karriere”, dass Marketing und Sales meine persönlichen Stärken sind und dass das Soziale meine Leidenschaft ist. So interpretierte ich es, dass ich vielleicht meine innere Ruhe nur dann finde wenn ich diese Elemente verbinde. Aus der Tourismusbranche und dem Entwicklungshilfesektor kommend, war ich somit auf der Suche nach einem Social Tourism Business Konzept. Wie und wo hast du „SHADES TOURS“ entdeckt? Im Januar 2015 war ich auf der Suche nach Social Tourism Konzepten in Europa und bin auf einen Artikel gestoßen, der „Touren geführt von Obdachlosen“ in Amsterdam, Prag, Barcelona und Berlin präsentierte. Fasziniert von dieser Idee habe ich die Projektleiter angeschrieben, die Touren besucht und mit den örtlichen Guides gesprochen. Aufgrund meiner Kenntnisse aus der Touristik wusste ich, dass einige besuchte Tourenmodelle in Wien nicht möglich sein würden, da diese am Fremdenführergewerbe „kratzen“ könnten. Nach der ersten Konzepterstellung führten mich meine Wege zu den ersten Leitern von Wiener Sozialeinrichtungen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Der Glaube daran, dass es tatsächlich funktionieren kann, motiviert mich jeden Morgen aufs Neue. Und dass ich dieser Aufgabe sowohl gewachsen, als auch mächtig bin. Das ist ein extrem wichtiges Detail, denn in der Selbstständigkeit gibt es immer wieder Momente des Zweifeilens und, wenn man sich in diesen Momenten diese Sicherheit immer wieder holt, dann gibt es einem die notwendige Motivation zur Implementierung. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Hätte man mir vor 5 Jahren gesagt, dass ich irgendwann mal selbstständig sein und mit Obdachlosen arbeiten würde, so hätte ich es nicht geglaubt. Die Entscheidung SHADES TOURS zu implementieren war sowohl eine rationale als auch emotionale Entscheidung. Der Glaube, dass das Gesamtprojekt (in seiner Gesamtheit mit allen Ober- und Unterzielen) funktionieren kann; die Evaluierung der eigenen Fähigkeiten; und das Wissen, dass es mich mehr Zeit als Geld kosten wird, haben dazu geführt, dass ich mich getraut habe. Hätte es eine hohe Kapitalinvestition benötigt, hätte ich es wahrscheinlich nicht gewagt. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? (Lacht.) Der Welt würde wahrscheinlich nichts abgehen. Mir und den Guides jedoch sehr viel. Den Tourenteilnehmern bietet SHADES TOURS eine Möglichkeit zur Information, Aufklärung und Engagement an–eine unvergessliche und bereichernde Erfahrung. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Nur weil SHADES TOURS meine Leidenschaft und Arbeit gleichzeitig ist, heißt es nicht, dass ich keine normale Gründerin bin. Hierzu zählt, dass ich weniger Zeit für Familie und Freunde investiere, weniger fernsehe, weniger ausgehe, usw. SHADES TOURS ist in jedem meiner Atemzüge und mein ständiger Begleiter. Mit SHADES TOURS verzichte ich auf ein geregeltes Angestelltenverhältnis, auf die Sicherheit eines Gehaltes, auf die Sicherheit mit 18:00 in den Feierabend zu gehen. Aber das sind die Selbstverständlichkeiten, die man auf sich nimmt, wenn man sich für die Selbstständigkeit entscheidet. Somit würde ich nicht sagen, dass ich wirklich auf etwas verzichte. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste an meiner Arbeit ist zu sehen, wie das Projekt Form annimmt und wie jeder Stakeholder darin etwas Positives für sich gewinnt–die Erstellung eines Gemeinschaftsprojektes. Jeder Tag ist einmalig und kein Tag gleicht einem anderen. Tage und Wochen vergehen wie im Flug. Ein Element gehört jedoch zu jedem einzelnen Tag dazu: die Energie und der Elan, die mich in der Früh aus dem Bett kitzeln. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Die, die an mich und SHADES TOURS glauben. Das sind sowohl die Guides, die Einrichtungsleiter, die Sozialträger, aber auch jeder einzelne SHADES TOURS Teilnehmer, der von unserer Arbeit begeistert ist. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Mein Freund, Mentoren und Freunde vom Impact Hub Vienna versuchen mich aufzubauen, wenn ich Sorgen habe. Ich habe jedoch einen Weg gefunden, mich selbst aufzubauen und mir selbst die Sätze aufzusagen, die ich brauche. Das ist mein eigenes kleines Mantra. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Zwar ist es nicht geheim, aber ich habe es noch viel zu selten erwähnt. Ich möchte SHADES TOURS als internationale Marke positionieren, um zukünftigen Social Entrepreneurs das zu bieten, wonach ich vor einem Jahr gesucht hatte. Eine Marke, der man sich mit seinem eigenen Projekt unterstellen und somit seine ganze Kraft in das Operative stecken kann. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Wenn man von seiner Leidenschaft auf einer rationalen und verständlichen Ebene erzählt, so erkennen Zuhörer nicht nur das Leuchten in deinen Augen, sondern verstehen auch den Sinn dahinter. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sehr unterschiedlich. Mein persönliches Umfeld war anfangs sehr skeptisch gegenüber SHADES TOURS. Erst als ich von fachkundigen Einschätzungen erzählen konnte, wurden sie beschwichtigt. Seit dem medialen Rückenwind sind alle begeistert und unterstützend, jedoch weiterhin noch in der Position zu sehen, ob es ein Hobby ist oder ein tatsächlicher Job. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ja klar. 1) Nicht Freunde, Bekannte und Familie nach Einschätzungen fragen, sondern mit fachkundigen Personen sprechen. 2) Sich trauen! Trauen mit fachkundigen Personen Kontakt aufzunehmen (Email an Unbekannte verschicken, Telefonanrufe zu tätigen) und sie bitten sich Zeit zu nehmen, um euren Ideen zu lauschen. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung? Im Moment lese ich „Start something that matters“ von Blake Mycoskie, der Social Entrepreneur von TOMS. Es ist eine angenehme Bett- und U-Bahn-Lektüre, die perfekt in die Gründungsphase von SHADES TOURS passt. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Tobias Judmaier von Iss Mich!

The four speakers, coming from a range of backgrounds and companies, tackled this issue in a concise yet varied way. Presenting using PechaKucha format: 20 seconds per slide for 20 slides, each speaker explored the main topic in relation to their areas of expertise. This innovative presenting format was new for many of the speakers, providing a great learning process for the speakers and the audience. Dietmar Millinger – “Helping volunteers to do good better” Dietmar started the evening addressing the topic, ‘Helping volunteers to do good better.’ He explored this topic using the platform he is currently working to develop. This app will allow charities and NGO’s to release ‘Tickets’ asking for the help they need. For example if they need water they will release 20 Tickets for 2 litre bottles of water. This shows up on ‘Volunteers Feed’ as a call for water bottles. The volunteer then commits to a number of Tickets. After the volunteers have brought 20 bottles of water the ‘Ticket’ has been fulfilled. The aim of this app/platform is to ensure that the NGO’s get the donations they require at the time they need them. It also addresses the issue of wasted donations, which is especially prevalent for food donations. ‘Help Today’ are aiming to make donations more efficient, by getting the right solution to the right place, which will help change the lives of those who really need help. Wnat to know more? Get in contact with Dietmar here. Simon Schmitz – “Being in Sync with Nature“ Simon is the CEO of aWATTar, a power supply company that encourages customers to time their energy usage when there is a surplus of green energy by giving them a monetary incentive. Currently there is a problem with storing energy, so when there is a surplus in green energy (wind and solar) the price of energy drops dramatically, creating a negative cost. The customer however pays the same rate regardless, allowing the energy company to profit massively. aWATTar is hoping to change that system. Last year there was 100 hours where the energy cost was negative. aWATTar is the first company to transfer this profit to the customer. On top of this they are introducing smart sensors into the home which automates certain functions in the house to turn on when energy is the cheapest. Using electric heating as an example, Simon explained that these devices would account for when energy is cheapest, due to a surplus, and then turn on the heating during these times. aWATTar have a big mission, and are currently facing a few roadblocks. For example, only certain houses have the necessary smart sensors installed. However as the world is shifting towards electrical energy usage, aWATTar are well positioned to offer a great solution to the standard energy provider. aWATTar are not only providing answers that address climate change, but also helping their customers save money.

Lena Robinson – “Tech in service of financial literacy“ Lena is the Communications Astronaut at Three Coins, a company which researches and develops methods which foster financial literacy. Lena explained that with technology, we have a unique opportunity to help educate the younger generations concerning financial literacy. This is especially impactful, as many physiologists believe financial behaviour is learnt through our interactions with technology. Three Coins has developed a game to address financial literacy, as they wanted a scalable solution that tackled the problem before it started. This approach is in stark contrast to the current reality which mainly offers a one to one basis with a financial accountant after the issues already develop. She spoke about some of the issues Three Coins has faced as they developed a game for educational purposes.They found that although it reaches a lot of people, youths often need a follow up session or workshop, to ensure the learnings have successfully transferred. It helps the youths take in their game experience and apply it to everyday situations. This solution however routes back to one of the issues within the financial sector in the first place, that the solutions aren’t scalable. To address this issue, they have started their “Train the Trainer” program, so they can spread their knowledge to other people around the globe. Find out more about Three Coins. Anna Iarotska – “Teaching kids how to code using robots“ Anna, Co-Founder at Robo Wunderkind, began by emphasising the difference between the growth in the toy market verses the rest of the world. Lego started using their plastic bricks in 1960, and still uses the same design today. However, in comparison, we need only look at architecture in 1960 verses today: we see a big difference in growth and change. She explained that Robo Wunderkind are addressing this gap in development, while educating future generations in the process. Robo Wunderkind have designed a modular robot, which can be programmed using a smartphone/tablet app. This allows children learn coding by gamifying the experience. They believe this early interaction with coding will help future generations revolutionise technology in the future. The Robot they have designed can be built by combining different cubes. Each cube has a different function: infrared receivers, light receivers sound receivers, speakers and motors, just to name a few. Robo Wunderkind are not only aiming to change the face of toys, but also change the educational opportunities children have with toys, hoping to create a spark the minds that will change technology in the future.

Mit Toilettenblog.at hat er Österreichs ersten Issue Blog über den „am meisten unterschätzten Alltagsgegenstand unserer Zeit“ ins Leben gerufen. Warum Toiletten für Milliarden Menschen purer Luxus sind und er sich ehrenamtlich im Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise engagiert, erzählt er uns im Interview. Ein schräges Thema mit ernstem Hintergrund. Markus, welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Es ist wohl die Leidenschaft am Außergewöhnlichen, die mich auszeichnet und zugleich auch antreibt. Anders sein, als alle anderen. Sonst würde ich wohl nicht über Toiletten bloggen und ein Thema in den Mittelpunkt rücken, über das man sonst nicht spricht – schon gar nicht in der Öffentlichkeit. Dabei sind Toiletten viel mehr als nur das, was wir auf den ersten Blick in ihnen sehen. Sie sind nicht nur der am meisten unterschätzte Alltagsgegenstand unserer Zeit, sondern in vielen Teilen der Welt auch echte Lebensretter. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Toiletten entdeckt? Die Leidenschaft hat sich aus einem Spaß heraus entwickelt. Ich habe 2010 begonnen, alle Toiletten zu fotografieren, die mich in meinem Leben begleiten. Sechs Jahre und über 600 Toilettenfotos später wurde daraus nicht nur ein eigener Issue Blog, sondern auch ein ehrenamtliches Engagement im Rahmen der World Toilet Organization (WTO, deren Mitglied ich bin), im Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Engagement gegeben? Ja. Denn während in unseren Breiten der Gang auf die Toilette nichts Außergewöhnliches darstellt, ist er in vielen Teilen der Welt alles andere als selbstverständlich. Mehr als 2,4 Milliarden Menschen auf diesem Planeten haben keinen Zugang zu einer ausreichenden Sanitärversorgung. Eine Milliarde ist gar gezwungen, ihre Notdurft im Freien zu verrichten. Auf diese Weise gelangen Krankheitserreger direkt in das Trinkwasser, in offene Trinkwasserstellen und letztlich auch in die Nahrungskette – ein Teufelskreis mit fatalen Folgen. Denn 80 Prozent aller Krankheiten in Entwicklungsländern stehen im Zusammenhang mit verunreinigtem Trinkwasser und knapp 600.000 Kinder unter fünf Jahren sterben jährlich an den Folgen von Durchfallerkrankungen; zurückzuführen auf katastrophale sanitäre Bedingungen und mangelnde Hygiene. Das ist der Auslöser und darauf mache ich aufmerksam. Mit dem Ziel, diesen Teufelskreis mit vereinten Kräften zu durchbrechen. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Weil das Thema Toiletten niemanden kalt lässt und längst auch die Vereinten Nationen auf den Plan gerufen hat. Internationale Zusammenarbeit und Aktionen rund um den jährlichen Welttoilettentag am 19. November sind Ausdruck dessen und enorm wichtig. Ich wünsche mir aber, dass die lebensrettende Rolle von Toiletten nicht nur an oder rund um diesen einen Tag im Jahr thematisiert wird, sondern das gesellschaftliche Engagement auch ganzjährig darüber hinausgeht. Mit meinem Toilettenblog will ich dazu beitragen, das Thema abseits eines bestimmten Kalenderdatums präsent zu halten. Dazu setze ich auf einen unkonventionellen und dennoch zeitgemäßen Kommunikationskanal, um genau das zu erreichen. Nämlich um aufzufallen und im Gespräch zu bleiben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es den Blog nicht gäbe? In Zeiten von gefühlten x-tausend beliebig austauschbaren Beauty-, Lifestyle-, Food- und Fashionblogs freut es mich, mit meinem Toilettenblog auch so etwas wie frischen Wind in die heimische Blogger-Szene zu bringen und neue Akzente zu setzen. Gäbe es den Toilettenblog nicht, wäre weiterhin alles more of the same. Und um das Thema wäre es bedeutend stiller. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In meiner Freizeit, abseits des Vollzeitjobs. Aber als Service Designer gehe ich ständig mit offenen Augen durch den Tag. Wenn Ideen oder Geistesblitze plötzlich da sind, dann muss man sie auch zulassen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zeitmanagement und Ehrenamtlichkeit sind meine größten Herausforderungen. Denn ich investiere einen Großteil meiner Freizeit abseits meines Vollzeitjobs als Unternehmensberater in den Blog, der für mich ein echtes Herzensanliegen ist. Weil das Thema wirklich wichtig ist. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Es ist immer wieder schön zu erleben, wie andere auf das Thema reagieren. Dass mein Blog auf den ersten Blick zu Verwunderung führt, nehme ich dabei gerne in Kauf. Ein bisschen Provokation hat noch nie geschadet um aufzufallen (lacht). Die Reaktionen sind eigentlich immer gleich. Werde ich anfangs noch belächelt, dass ich über Toiletten blogge, so folgt nach einem kurzen Hinweis auf den ernsten Hintergrund des Themas meist Staunen und Betroffenheit – häufig in Verbindung mit dem Austausch eigener, selbst er- oder durchlebter Toilettengeschichten. Wenn es soweit kommt, habe ich bereits gewonnen. Denn durch den gegenseitigen Austausch von Erfahrungen und Geschichten entsteht eine besonders intensive Form der Beschäftigung mit dem Thema. Und das ist für eine nachhaltige Bewusstseinsbildung unerlässlich. Wenn man so will, betreibe ich also Toiletten-Storytelling im Dienst der guten Sache. Ungewöhnlich, aber wirkungsvoll. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Allen voran meine Frau. Sie hat mein Engagement von Anbeginn unterstützt und bringt mich auch inhaltlich immer wieder auf neue Ideen. Aber auch Familie, Freunde, Bekannte und Kollegen gehören dazu, die mich immer wieder aufs Neue bestärken, dieses Herzensprojekt weiterzuführen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Nicht wer, sondern eher was. Nämlich die Gewissheit, dass ich über ein Thema blogge, das jeden gleichermaßen betrifft und das keinen Trends, Modeerscheinungen oder sonstigen Befindlichkeiten unterliegt. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Nachdem Toiletten ein Querschnittsthema mit Anknüpfungspunkten in alle Bereiche des täglichen Lebens sind, will ich meinen Blog künftig noch breiter aufstellen. Außerdem arbeite ich derzeit daran, bis zum kommenden Welttoilettentag am 19. November das umfangreichste deutschsprachige Informationsportal zum Thema aufzubauen. Dazu will ich auch weitere Partner aus dem Gesundheits-, Sanitär- und Technologiebereich mit ins Boot holen. Es bleibt also auf jeden Fall spannend. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Über den schrägen, unkonventionellen und natürlich auch humoristischen Einstieg in ein außergewöhnliches Thema, das in Wahrheit ein sehr ernstes ist. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Natürlich wurde ich anfangs belächelt. Das ist aber kein Thema mehr. Im Gegenteil. Mein Umfeld ist mittlerweile zu einem wichtigen Multiplikator-Netzwerk geworden, das mich immer wieder auf neue Aspekte, Ideen oder potenzielle Kooperationspartner aufmerksam macht. Dafür bin ich dankbar und weiß das sehr zu schätzen. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Natürlich. Statistisch gesehen geht jeder von uns sechs bis acht Mal täglich auf die Toilette und verbringt während seines Lebens bis zu zwei Jahre am Ort des Loslassens. Das ist unglaublich viel Lebenszeit, die man auch sinnvoll nutzen kann. Die Toilette ist heutzutage einer der wenigen Rückzugsorte im Alltag, an dem man noch ungestört ist und abschalten kann. Wenn man es also von diesem Gesichtspunkt betrachtet, ist die Toilette nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck, sondern auch eine mentale Kraftquelle. Und im Vergleich mit den 2,4 Milliarden Menschen, die keinen Zugang zu Toiletten haben, ist sie außerdem purer Luxus. Dessen sollte man sich immer bewusst sein. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Am meisten wünsche ich mir, dass der Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise Wirkung zeigt und es mit vereinten internationalen Kräften gelingt, Leben zu retten. Bis es soweit ist, gibt es noch viel zu tun – aber die Richtung stimmt. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung? „Happy End – die stillen Örtchen dieser Welt“ von Nina Sedano. Sie hat jedes Land der Welt bereist und nimmt ihre LeserInnen mit auf eine spannende Reise durch die unterschiedlichsten Toilettenkulturen und Bräuche. Kurzweilig, informativ und für weltoffene Menschen unglaublich spannend. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Madeleine Sophie Daria. Besser bekannt als dariadaria. Weil sie ihre Reichweite und Relevanz als eine der erfolgreichsten österreichischen Bloggerinnen mittlerweile dafür nutzt, um neben dem üblichen „Blogger-Kommerz“ auch verstärkt auf gesellschaftskritische Themen aufmerksam zu machen. Dafür hat sie nicht nur meinen Respekt, sondern auch mich als Follower gewonnen. www.toilettenblog.at","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mashup-Banner-600x400.jpg","April 12, 2016","de",0.996752440929413,0.0135626804549247,0.534701496362686,0.0453559493180364,0.406379848718643

They answered the call from Impact Hub Vienna and one weekend they all gathered together for a magical event called ‘The Storytelling Hackathon for Social Impact’. They came from many faraway lands – Spain, Turkey, Macedeonia, Bulgaria, England, The Czech Republic, Italy, Germany and The Netherlands – to attend this event held in the Kingdom of Vienna. In fact, more than 40 creative minds and social entrepreneurs gathered for 48 hours to collaborate and help some incredible Vienna based organisations share their stories with the world. The aim of the weekend was to create stories and raise awareness for 7 social impact ventures that are currently working to create change. On Friday evening at Impact Hub Vienna, a Town Crier from each of the 7 ventures spoke about their organisation and explained their challenges. Issues to be tackled over the weekend included: Showcasing the potential of a Robo Wunderkind robot to children Giving a personal and human face to the green energy company aWATTar Building a unique selling proposition for good food company Iss Mich! Finding how to better encourage entrepreneurs and ventures to apply for funding through the Investment Ready Program Creating an awareness campaign for computer recycling organization Compuritas Encouraging neighbours to register for the Frag Nebeban community program Finding the best way to remove labels and sterotypes for refugeeswork.at Participants listened in and were invited to chose their top 3 favourite challenges to work on. 7 groups were then created with a mix of professions, including bloggers, photographers, graphic designers, social entrepreneurs, illustrators, web designers, authors and directors. These groups were tasked with creating a ‘tale for the ages’ regarding their chosen venture. In addition to helping these organisations fill a gap in their marketing strategy, participants would walk away knowing that they were helping to make the world a better place. Fuelled by caffeine, sugar and enthusiasm they embarked on their quest. The groups worked furiously for 48 hours, bonding and networking, thinking outside the box and making magic. They drew, photographed, programmed, videoed and designed. In the lead up to the final showcase Ann Cathrin from Germany was glowing. “I am so happy to have had the opportunity to collaborate with so many creative minds. We had to learn to work as a team – everyone contributed hence everyone had ownership of the final product.” Sunday night everyone gathered in the town square, along with many of the other Vienna villagers, to hear each others stories. The results were simply incredible. In just 48 hours the groups had created new print, social media and advertising campaigns. They had designed logos, made websites and even designed stationery. The human side of some technical ventures were conveyed through videos and photography. Websites had been simplified and redesigned, and a new food packaging campaign was created. Ideas were fun, practical and beneficial to all the ventures. Participants left the event buzzing, motivated, and inspired. New friendships were created and partnerships formed. They travelled back to their faraway lands inspired and motivated……..","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bildschirmfoto_2016-03-10_um_10.07.01-600x400.png","April 20, 2016","en",0.996207535266876,0.000516405678354204,0.258521199226379,0.000353440962499008,0.740608930587769

Nur wenige Monates später, im November 2015 folgte dann die Gründung von „Refugeeswork.at“, Österreichs erster Online Job-Plattform für geflüchtete Menschen. Refugeeswork.at bringt geflüchtete Menschen mit ArbeitgeberInnen zusammen. Den Flüchtlingen wird so der Zugang zu Arbeits- und Ausbildungsplätzen, die ihren Fähigkeiten entsprechen, erleichtert. ArbeitgeberInnen können versteckte Talente finden und von einer höheren Diversität ihrer MitarbeiterInnen zu profitieren. Was treibt Dich an? Die Arbeit mit großartigen Menschen und der Gedanke gemeinsam gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen, um nachhaltig etwas zu verändern – Stichwort: Impact! Hat es für dieses Projekt einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Mein erster Berührungspunkt mit dem Thema „Arbeitsmarktintegration von geflüchteten Menschen“ war, als ein Unternehmer mich um Hilfe bat, weil er einen Flüchtling beschäftigen wollte, aber die rechtliche Lage nicht kannte. Die endgültige Entscheidung Refugeeswork.at zu gründen, habe ich nach einer Begegnung mit einem Flüchtling getroffen. Ich habe mich ca. 1 Stunde mit ihm unterhalten und mit ihm über seine Vergangenheit und seine Pläne für die Zukunft gesprochen. Ich war beeindruckt von seiner starken Persönlichkeit und seinen Ambitionen, und konnte nicht verstehen, warum wir das Potential solcher Menschen in Österreich nicht nützen. Also habe ich es mir zur Aufgabe gemacht, daran etwas zu ändern. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt Integrationsarbeit bei Dir ein? Einen sehr hohen! Sie ist der einzige Weg, um geflüchtete Menschen in unsere Gesellschaft integrieren und ihnen so eine Perspektive zu schenken. Abgesehen davon, sehe ich die „Flüchtlingskrise“ – trotz aller Schwierigkeiten – als große Chance, da wir ein demographisches Problem haben, dass wir ohne Zuwanderung nicht lösen werden können. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Sehr neugierig. Ich lese sehr viel und interessiere mich für viele Dinge. Welche Rolle spielt Freiwilligenarbeit bei dir ganz persönlich? Ich denke, dass Freiwilligenarbeit das Potential hat viel zu verändern, vor allem, wenn Freiwillige NGOs mit ihren Kernfähigkeiten unterstützen. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Um ehrlich zu sein, haben sich beide Projekte relativ zufällig ergeben. Wirklich angefangen an diesen Projekten zu arbeiten haben wir, weil wir in beiden Fällen davon überzeugt waren, dass sie unheimlich großes Impact-Potential haben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Wenn es uns nicht geben würde, würde hoffentlich jemand anderes genau das tun, was wir gerade tun. Zumindest glaube ich daran, dass es – vor allem in unserem Alter – unheimlich viele Menschen gibt, die wahnsinnig motiviert sind gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen und etwas zu verändern. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Bei meiner Arbeit, mit dem besten Team überhaupt. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Ich arbeite unheimlich gerne und es gibt Vieles was ich dabei „schön“ finde. Zum einen, zu wissen, dass ich nicht nur arbeite, um Geld zu verdienen. Zum anderen, zu sehen auf wieviel die Menschen in meinem Team verzichten und wie sehr sie sich dafür einsetzen unsere Ideen und Überzeugungen zu verwirklichen. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Team meine Freundin, meine Freunde und meine Familie. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Vor allem meine Freundin und mein Team. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Ja, ich gründe gerade mit 2 Freunden ein neues Unternehmen, bei dem ich allerdings im Tagesgeschäft bzw. operativ nicht stark involviert sein werde. Die Idee ist Unternehmen dabei zu helfen Personalmanagement und Recruiting so zu gestalten, dass gleichzeitig sozialer Mehrwert geschaffen wird – sozusagen Personalmanagement & Recruiting mit Impact! Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Ich denke, dass liegt eher an den Projekten, die sich ergeben und den Menschen, die ich zufällig treffe. Bis jetzt hatte ich das großes Glück, immer die richtigen Leute zur richtigen Zeit getroffen zu haben! Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden gut was ich tue, aber es ist manchmal ein bisschen schwer, weil ich relativ wenig Freizeit habe. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Einfach anfangen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Für mich selbst nicht, ich bin glücklich so wie alles ist. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung? Es gibt unheimlich viele gute Bücher… … aber da sind zwei Bücher, die ich zwar selbst noch nicht gelesen haben, aber auf jeden Fall bald lesen werde: Holacracy von Brian J. Robertson und Reinventing Organisations von Frederic Laloux’s.

In den vergangenen 12 Jahren war Christoph im Kulturmanagement, Banking, Online Marketing und im Startup-Bereich tätig. Neben seinem BWL-Studium an der WU Wien machte er erste Erfahrungen im Consulting und arbeitete für Vermögensverwaltungen in Wien und Liechtenstein. Zeitgleich baute Christoph ein Auktionshaus für österreichische Kunst aus dem 20. und 21. Jahrhundert auf. Nach 6 Jahren im Banking und Kulturmanagement spezialisierte er sich auf Online Marketing mit Fokus auf Social Media. 2013 gründete Christoph mit 5 jungen Unternehmern den gemeinnützigen Verein AustrianStartups zur Förderung und Unterstützung von Startups. AustrianStartups ist erste Anlaufstelle für jeden Startup-Interessierten und der neutrale Startup Community-Entwickler in Österreich. Gegründet von einer Unternehmerin und 5 Unternehmern 2013, ist AustrianStartups ein gemeinnütziger Verein, in dem rund 50 ehrenamtliche Mitarbeiter täglich damit beschäftigt sind, Startups das Leben in Österreich einfacher zu machen. Christoph, was treibt Dich an? Das Unmögliche, das Unbekannte, Synergien zwischen Menschen herstellen, unlösbare Probleme, Ehrlichkeit & Offenheit und spannende Projekte. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Entrepreneurship entdeckt? Wahrscheinlich war es in meiner Jugend, als ich als ehrenamtlicher Betreuer & Coach für Kinder und Jugendliche tätig war. Was fasziniert dich am Unternehmertum so? Es sind einerseits die Menschen dahinter und ihre Geschäftsidee, die große Probleme lösen, ganze Industrien auf den Kopf stellen und mitunter bahnbrechende Innovationen hervorbringen. Andererseits liebe ich die Lösungsorientierung von Startup-UnternehmerInnen: don’t bullshit, just do it. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Engagement bei und für AustrianStartups gegeben? Als mich ein Freund fragte, ob ich AustrianStartups mit ihm und 4 anderen GründerInnen aufbauen möchte, war das Startup Thema noch vollkommen neu für mich. Nationale wie internationale Beispiele haben mich einfach fasziniert: dafür eine off- und online Community Plattform zu bauen, hat mich dann gefesselt. Was sind Deine Ziele mit AustrianStartups? Jeder Mensch, der ein Startup in Österreich gründen möchte, soll durch unsere Arbeit 2-3 Schritte weiterkommen. Zusätzlich möchte ich gemeinsam mit Startuppern an besseren Bedingungen für Gründerinnen und Gründer arbeiten. Wieviel Leidenschaft braucht Entrepreneurship? Wieviel Leidenschaft brauchen GründerInnen von Startups? Leidenschaft ist für mich der Dreh- und Angelpunkt von Entrepreneurship. Sie ist die treibende Kraft, die GründerInnen dazu bringt, mehr ins Risiko zu gehen und Zeit & Energie einzusetzen als andere. Vielleicht haben Startup-Gründer etwas mehr Leidenschaft als ein klassischer Gründer, weil es schwieriger, riskanter und aufwändiger ist. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Aktuell bestimmt es mein gesamtes Leben, weil ich neben AustrianStartups auch mein Studium mit dem Schwerpunkt Entrepreneurship & Innovation abschließe. Aber für mich ist Entrepreneurship mehr eine Geisteshaltung oder eine Gewohnheit, die man nicht abstellen kann. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? O ja. Wenn mich etwas interessiert, dann kann die Zeit schon einmal verfliegen und Stunden gelesen, gefilmt, geschaut oder recherchiert werden. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Euch nicht geben würde? Zeit. Mit all dem, was AustrianStartups tut, versuchen wir einerseits Startup-Interessierten den Einstieg bzw. das Gründen und Startup Betreiben zu erleichtern. So findet die Gründerin ihren neuen Mitarbeiter auf einem Stammtisch, oder ein Startup eine Investitionsmöglichkeit. Andererseits arbeiten wir eng mit allen Stakeholdern zusammen, um als neutraler Knotenpunkt gemeinsam die Community voranzubringen. Was treibt Dich an immer wieder neue Projekt zu starten? Irgendwie bin ich da rastlos und muss mir nach einer gewissen Zeit ein weiteres oder neues Projekt suchen. Dabei sind es einfach neue Ideen und spannende Problemlösungen. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich nehme ihn mir einfach. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Wahrscheinlich genügend Schlaf, aber das ist es mir wert. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Mich beeindruckt am meisten die Bereitschaft so vieler faszinierende Menschen in Österreich, sich für andere GründerInnen einzusetzen, damit sie aus ihren Fehlern lernen können. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Sehr oft hilft mir da ein offenes und „non judgmental“ Ohr, das ich bei meiner Freundin und Freunden finde. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Da lasse ich mich überraschen. Für mich ist immer entscheidend, was ist die Idee und welches Team steht dahinter. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Weil ich selber dafür glühe und keine Scheu habe, dass auch zu zeigen. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Manchmal kommen sie mir wie ein Fan Club vor <U+0001F609> Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Nicht zu viel planen, sondern einfach machen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Zu viele <U+0001F609> Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? In den vergangenen Jahren gab es 4 Dinge, die mich inspiriert und zum Nachdenken gebracht haben: die täglichen Vlogs von Startupgründer & Youtuber Casey Neistat; TEDxVienna Konferenzen; die Berge & Seen im Salzkammergut und Reisen. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen?

Spring has arrived once again. Spring is not just blossoms bursting forth; it is also a time when we celebrate our planet. So in honor of all the Earth Day celebrations, we wanted to feature some of our Impact Hub members that are creating some pretty powerful green impact. Meet Impact Hub member Angie Rattay: Angie is the founder of NEONGREEN Network, an online platform changing the world through connecting people, networks and information. Angie also founded EARTHtalks an annual conference focused on addressing environmental issues. So Angie, what are you working on? At the moment we are in the finishing stretch of organising one of the biggest eco-social bottom-up events in Europe! The EARTHtalks are almost fully booked with only a few seats remaining for both the interactive morning program – the Neongreen HubClub – as well as the main event. Tickets are still available at www.erdgespraeche.net, but not for long! What needs to go in your green smoothie? The NEONGREEN Smoothie needs a pinch of motivation, a spoon full of activism, a big portion of voluntary work and good vibes on top. Up next is Theresa Steininger: Theresa is the chief director at Wohnwagon, a company producing ecologically and sustainably tiny houses, as well an incredible resource for those wanting to live a more self-sufficient lifestyle. So Theresa, what is Wohnwagon currently working on? We want to inspire more people to rethink the way we live – that is why we developed our latest “baby” – the magazine “OSKAR” for independent and sustainable living. It is112 pages of inspiration, tips and interesting projects that show how it can be done. We are also working on building our production for the Wohnwagon to better serve our customers. And what would be in your ideal green smoothie? Passion, a great network and an awesome team! Finally we checked in with Bettina Steinbrugger: Bettina is a co-founder of erdbeerwoche, a company tackling the issue of sustainability within feminine hygiene products and taking this issue mainstream. Bettina what are you and erdbeerwoche currently working on? Many things in parallel! erdbeerwoche is currently expanding to the DACH region, that is why we just finished a film project with WDR. We currently participate at several trade shows in Germany and will enter the Swiss market with our onlineshop soon! What needs to be in a your ideal green smoothie? I actually prefer red smoothies, as in bloody red, but if it needs to be a green one: Kiwi, banana, some herbs and a lot of passion. I am certainly inspired by all the green smoothie ideas as well as the incredible impact created by our Hub members! What do you put in your green smoothie? How are you celebrating Spring and creating green impact? Let us know on Facebook and Instagram!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/03/workshop-fear-and-failure/","ImpactHub","Workshop| Fear and fail"," What is failure? How do we define it? If we don’t fail, can we count it as success? These and many other questions were tackled at the recent workshop put on by the Fear and Fail movement at Impact Hub Vienna, supported by Christine Spernbauer and Impact Hub Scaling. The format of the event was designed to be interactive instead of just a talkfest. The night started when we were all tasked with meeting people around us without giving our name and without talking about what we do. A little tougher than it sounds! After we mingled, we broke into 3 groups. The aim of these groups was to come up with 2 questions for each of our guest speakers. Not only did we get to interact with the speakers themselves, but we also got to enjoy interesting conversation and listen to differing opinions from participants in the room. Our first speaker was Eugene Quinn, an expat from London who didn’t move to Vienna by choice. Eugene spoke about what it was like to move to Austria and leave your home country. Coming to a city that was more conservative and clinging to tradition could have been considered a challenge destined to fail. Instead, Eugene faced it head on and deliberately took on tasks that took him (and others) out of their comfort zones. Learning German, for example, is something that Eugene is proud of. Make no mistake, his German isn’t perfect – he likes to refer to it as ‘Freestyle Deutsch’ – but he doesn’t see this as a failure. Instead, he celebrates his mistakes because he believes it is about the message he is communicating, rather than the grammar. Eugene also talked about turning ‘failures’ into opportunities. His company spaceandplace.at runs ‘Vienna Ugly’ a walking tour showcasing some of the worst of Vienna’s buildings. The city of Vienna fined him for this, believing it was against what Vienna stood for. Then Eugene took a risk and spoke publicy about his fine, explaining how Vienna wasn’t ready to move forward with innovative new ideas. The media grabbed the story and his tours became even more popular. He also didn’t receive any more fines. Our second speaker was Neha Chatwani from The Workplace Atelier. An organizational psychologist Neha used examples from her career to demonstrate how she dealt with fear. It started when she was rejected from her first job interview because they believed she didn’t ‘look’ like she could do it. Rather than letting this fear of rejection shape her life, she approached it head-on and used it to help her keep focus. When Neha was 10 years old, she began observing adults and watching how they navigated the world. They woke up in the morning, went to work, earned money, went grocery shopping and generally took good care of themselves. The problem was that 10 year old Neha could not imagine how she would become this ‘responsible adult’ she was observing. It seemed impossible. Luckily her mother gave her some valuable advice that she has come back to many times throughout her life: wait and see. Over time, Neha has learnt to trust herself and her judgements. Neha has developed her own unique way of addressing challenges and will regularly sit down on the couch to have conversations with herself – out loud. For her, this puts things into perspective and she is able to gain focus. She has no problem laughing at her mistakes, and when something doesn’t turn out exactly as planned, she simply adjusts her expectations. The takeaway of the workshop for this blogger was when Neha said, “Define your own definition of success. Don’t let anyone else determine it for you. They have no idea what makes you tick or makes you happy. Why should they get a say in your happiness?” ","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fear-and-Fail-Blog-600x400.jpg","May 3, 2016","en",0.996113717556,0.0776911899447441,0.647920906543732,0.0937987118959427,0.18058916926384

Thiemo ist seit jeher unternehmerisch denkend und aktiv, medienaffin, technologieversiert, gerne unterwegs auf Reisen, und er liebt gutes Essen. Mit dem Fifteen Seconds Festival machen wir am 16. und 17. Juni 2016 in Graz eine Konferenz, die einfach anders ist. Keine Egos, keine Titel, kein Bullshit. Dafür ein intensives zweitägiges Erlebnis, das einen klaren Auftrag hat: challenging the commercial future. Mit dabei sind Vordenker von The New York Times, Shazam, Buzzfeed, Red Bull, GQ, Oracle, Allianz und vielen weiteren globalen Marken. Was treibt Dich an? Etwas Neues zu erschaffen, jeden Tag mit motivierten Leuten an einer Vision zu arbeiten, viel unterwegs zu sein und beeindruckende Menschen, Unternehmen und Orte kennenzulernen. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für genau dieses Projekt entdeckt? Ich war gemeinsam mit meinem Mitgründer auf zahlreichen internationalen Konferenzen unterwegs und wir haben jedes Mal, wenn wir nach Österreich zurückgekommen sind, festgestellt, dass es hierzulande — mit wenigen Ausnahmen [Pioneers Festival] — an innovativen Konferenzformaten mangelt. Gepaart mit unserer brennenden Leidenschaft für Marketing war das die Geburtsstunde unseres Unternehmens. Was ist das Reizvolle dabei? Wenn tausende Leute vor der Tür warten und dann begeistert sind von dem, woran man ein Jahr lang hart mit einem eingeschworenen Team gearbeitet hat. Internationale Größen kennenzulernen, Lernerlebnisse zu gestalten, die etwas auslösen in den Menschen und nachhaltige Netzwerke zwischen Teilnehmern, Speakern und Partnern zu spinnen. Was war alles vor „Fifteen Seconds“? Ich habe früh begonnen, mich selbstständig zu machen und freiberuflich als Designer für Kunden und Agenturen zu arbeiten. Meine nächste Station hat mich zu einem Softwareunternehmen gebracht, wo ich ein Jahr lang das Unternehmen auch Marketing- und Vertriebsseitig mit aufbauen durfte und neben der Mitarbeit an spannenden Projekten auch viel unternehmerische Erfahrung gesammelt habe. Was sind Eure längerfristigen Ziele mit „Fifteen Seconds“? Wir leben modernen praxisorientierten Wissenstransfer in einer globalen Community. Diese Position wollen wir mit dem Festival als die Konferenzveranstaltung im deutschsprachigen Raum weiter ausbauen und dabei weiters auch ganzjährig unserem Ziel nachkommen, Netzwerkmöglichkeiten zu schaffen und spannenden Persönlichkeiten internationaler Marken eine Bühne und Plattform zu bieten. Internationale Formate stehen dabei jedenfalls auf unserer Liste, genauso wie ein gesundes Wachstum zuhause. Wie gelingt es Dir, so außergewöhnliche Speaker nach Graz zu bekommen? Wir sind das ganze Jahr über an Persönlichkeiten dran, die uns inhaltlich begeistern. Diese Recherchearbeit endet in vielen hunderten Vorschlägen, die wir in regelmäßigen Abständen gemeinsam besprechen und dann sehr hartnäckig anschreiben. Vielen schreiben sofort zurück, mit einigen führen wir lange Gespräche und an manchen sind wir mehrere Monate lang dran. Der Prozess unterliegt zwei goldenen Wörtern mit Bindestrich: Follow-up. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Der internationale Titel unseres Festivals lautet ja Europe’s Festival for Curious Minds. Der beschreibt genau das, was mich auch als Mensch antreibt: die Bereit- und Leidenschaft für lebenslanges Lernen und der stete Blick über den Tellerrand hinaus. Das ist für mich Neugier, also ja. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Euch nicht geben würde? Jede Menge internationaler Spirit, ein motiviertes Team, das aus Graz heraus einmal im Jahr ein starkes Line-up internationaler Entscheidungsträger von globalen Marken vereint, viele spannende Geschichten auf der Bühne und online und eine Plattform, die zum Netzwerken und Lernen einlädt. Allem voran: Eine stetig wachsende Community, die etwas bewegen will, Bock auf die Zukunft hat und Mut dafür macht. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Tagtäglich entweder in unserem Büro mit unserem Team oder unterwegs auf Reisen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zeitweise auf Freizeit, aber da Arbeit für mich nie negativ konnotiert war, erlebe ich das nicht als Verzicht. Natürlich ist speziell die Zeit vor dem Festival sehr vereinnahmend, wenn man dafür aber jeden Morgen weiß, wofür man aufsteht, ist es das ohne jeden Zweifel wert. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Abwechslung, die die Arbeit rund um das Festival mit sich bringt. Das Team, mit dem man Jahr für Jahr Großartiges auf die Beine stellen kann. Die Kontakte, die sich dabei ergeben. Hautnah mitzuerleben, wie etwas Großes entsteht. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Danke Mama für das gute Mittagessen jeden Sonntag. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Freunde, Familie und ein Team, das immer an unseren Erfolg glaubt. Auch oder vor allem in Zeiten, wo wir noch keinen Namen hatten und uns in Österreich viel Gegenwind entgegenkam. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Aktuell konzentrieren wir unsere Arbeit auf den 16. und 17. Juni und werden im Sommer in einen ausgiebigen Urlaub starten, danach gehen wir neue Projekte und Ziele an. Wie gelingt es Dir, Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Was wir seitdem wir gestartet sind nie geändert haben, ist unsere Liebe zum Detail in allem, was wir machen. Ich denke, dass eben das, gemeinsam mit der Leidenschaft, die wir an den Tag legen, andere Menschen begeistert und automatisch mitreißt. Es ist doch immer so: Nur wenn du selbst von etwas zu 100% überzeugt bist und dafür in deinem Herzen brennst, erzeugst du eine Energie, die andere ansteckt und mitnimmt. Das ist der erste Punkt, an dem etwas Großes in Bewegung kommen kann und man Momentum gewinnt. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Anfangs war es für viele nicht greifbar und verständlich, wohin die Reise gehen könnte. Trotzdem habe ich immer viel Unterstützung aus dem Umfeld von Freunden und Familie erfahren, mittlerweile fiebern sie genauso wie das Team jedem Festival entgegen. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Sich nicht von Nein-Sagern entmutigen zu lassen, davon gibt es ja hierzulande leider zu viele. An seine Vision zu glauben und weiterzumachen, egal wie hart es zwischendurch sein mag. Nicht zuletzt: Den 16. und 17. Juni in Graz zu verbringen und gerne auch unser Magazin fifteenseconds.co zu lesen, da bauen wir gerade was auf. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Alles was in meiner Hand liegt, woran ich selbst arbeiten kann, sind für mich keine Wünsche, sondern Ziele. Wünsche sind für mich Dinge, die ich nicht beeinflussen kann und das ist die Gesundheit von allen Leuten, die mir wichtig sind. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Das wäre ein Buch MANAGE YOUR DAY TO DAY, ein Magazin THE VERGE und ein YouTube-Channel VOX . Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Unbedingt Martin Auer.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/11/storytelling-language-can-build/","ImpactHub","Storytelling: The Language We Can Build On","When I applied for the Storytelling Hackathon hosted at Impact Hub Vienna a few weekends ago, I didn’t know I would meet a community that speaks the same language. A few weeks ago, my magazine, DoR, celebrated seven years. Starting in 2009 as an experiment, we wanted to show people how we thought a good magazine should look like and read. Since then, it has become a leading name in Romanian journalism and synonymous with the idea of powerful storytelling. From the beginning, DoR strove to advocate for the virtues of the story, as a tool to explain how the world changes. From writing on the importance of diacritical letters which make the Romanian language special, to how a city tries to hide its Roma residents behind a wall, to what happened to Bucharest firefighters when they lost a colleague in a fire for the first time in 45 years, we documented personal stories and told them in a way which allowed the readers to connect, to empathize, and to understand. We built and continue to build bridges through the stories we tell. In 2011 we took it further and began organizing an annual storytelling conference called The Power of Storytelling. Here we bring Pulitzer Prize and National Magazine Awards winners, writers, illustrators, photographers, documentary film makers, musicians, journalism entrepreneurs, and all sorts of storytellers who can share their craft with an audience. Slowly, we built more than bridges: we built a community of storytellers, people who strive to show, not tell. While this community of storytellers was an important step, we still have a long way to go before we can definitively say storytelling is a common tool in Romania. When I think on my experience in training NGO professionals, it seems that numbers continue to have more weight in their eyes than personal stories. And as I continued to lead more trainings, the past five years account to very little change in the way organizations explain what they do. Which is precisely why I was excited about the Storytelling Hackathon led by Impact Hub Vienna a few weekends ago. However, as my previous experience showed me, I was also weary about what we would be able to accomplish in such a short time. I couldn’t imagine how we could bring all our expertise to a common ground in just 48 hours. Well, little did I know what a magical a weekend it would turn out to be. I should’ve seen it coming when we spent about two hours on Saturday creating adventure stories for Robo Wunderkind, our assigned project, and discarding most of them for being not exciting enough. “But this is so predictable”, would say Clemens. “But this does not show us how it works”, would say Inbar. “But this doesn’t allow us to connect with the character”, would say Hailey. No one fought for their egos, no one thought they had the best idea. But they all fought for the story. A story that would make sense, that would be exciting, that would give us a character to cheer for. Also, a story that would be true in all aspects: that would show truthfully what Robo Wunderkind can do, (in case you haven’t checked it out, it’s a modular programmable robot for children that can do tons of functions) and that would ring true to the audience, meaning that the storyline, the logic, and the drive would be believable. After we decided what to do (stop motion video, online sharing platform, and story instrucitonal booklets), I got caught up in the production process. I didn’t think about how easily we reached a consensus, until the debriefing at the end of the Hackathon, on Sunday night. I looked around me and there were about 50 people in the room. In 48 hours, we had produced campaigns, videos, platforms, posters, messages and packaging for seven local initiatives. I had just watched three videos for a service that brings together skilled refugees and Austrian employers and I had been in awe at how nuanced, profound and truly prejudice-challenging they were. I had seen a campaign that showed us that all vegetables are the same on the inside, no matter how ugly or beautiful they are on the outside. I had been floored by a campaign that turned something as dry as saving energy into an idea easy to understand and get behind. And all that through stories. Stories that were true, specific, and relatable. And that is when I realized what a wonderful experience the Hackathon was for us. Everyone involved understood the importance of the storytelling. This inherent basis allowed us to create complex, real and useful content that can bring people closer to the projects and closer to each other. Although we came from different countries, although we had such diverse professional backgrounds, we all spoke the same language in terms of storytelling. To me, that is proof that even in the absence of common words or cultural references, we can build bridges (and campaigns, for that matter) based only on our understanding of what makes a good story. Because as I learned a long time ago, a good story is always the answer to the question “How should I live my life?” And no matter where we come from, we all need to find that answer.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hackathonheader-600x400.jpg","May 11, 2016","en",0.994946718215942,0.0118162690196186,0.302172385156155,0.0028080097399652,0.683203354477882
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/13/writing-those-first-words-skill-share-breakfast-with-salwa-youssef/","ImpactHub","Where to Begin: Skill Share Breakfast with Writer Salwa Youssef","One Wednesday morning 15 writers (published and aspiring) met at Impact Hub Vienna for a Skill Share Breakfast. Led by Salwa Yossef, a published writer with experience across many topics, they all learned the important steps one should take before beginning to write a piece. Salwa talked us through a tried and true method to writing a great novel, article, poem or even love letter. Planning, she explained, is key to success and should never be underestimated. To plan well you need to cover the following stages: The ‘When’ part: Deadlines are critical in writing. If you aren’t given one, make one for yourself! Contact people, make appointments and collect information. You undertake passive thinking (where you think about the assignment during normal activities and let it percolate) and active thinking (when you link the story through research, interviews etc). The ‘Who’ part: Here it is important to identify to two key players. Firstly, who are we writing for and what do they want addressed through the piece you are writing? It is important to fully understand the outputs or key points this person would like to see in our piece, before we begin. Secondly, we need to identify the audience we are writing for. What are the key points they need to know? The ‘What’ part: What are we going to write about? Along with this question comes another – ‘What is my style?’ This is the time to think about how the piece will be written. Is it promotional? Academic? Informative? Entertaining? The ‘Where’ part: Every writer is different and though it may sound silly, everyone has a place where they prefer to write. This is the place where they feel comfortable and the writing flows. Whenever you need to write, go to that place! The ‘Why’ part: Write like it’s your job. It was here that Salwa explained that she didn’t think of writing as art, because there is always a right and a wrong. Spelling, grammar and punctuation must all be correct – and this is SO important! After you have gone through these stages, then you begin to write. Pieces of the Pie: The first 2/3 of your piece comes together by connecting all the dots. You put all different pieces of the story together and juggle them around till you create something. The next 1/3 comes when you rewrite. Sleep on it and then rewrite again. And repeat. Final Touches: Then comes editing and proofreading. Salwa stressed that editing is a skill and it is important to use a professional editor, and not just another writer friend, when editing your work. It is here that your words are refined and finessed and fit for publishing. Once your piece has been edited, you then need to proofread. This can be done by a friend or a professional. It is at this point we ensure the story has consistency and no mistakes. Take-aways: Great advice from someone who has been there and done that. We were left with a lot of other juicy advice, but the final (and for me the most important) word of wisdom we were told was to have FUN; remember to experiment, try new things, and enjoy the process.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/17/creative-process-48-hours/","ImpactHub","The Creative Process in 48 Hours","The first time I heard about the 1001Vienna – a Storytelling Hackathon for Social Impact was early one Friday morning in February. It was for a Creative Mornings lectures and it was the first time I set foot in the Impact Hub Vienna. Despite being only half awake, I immediately felt the energy of the place and was intrigued by the people there. When I heard that the Hackathon would accept 40 creatives from across Europe for a weekend workshop, I was eager to apply even though I wasn’t quite sure what a ‘Storytelling Hackathon’ actually was. I guess eagerness doesn’t always lead to action, because the next thing I knew, the day of the deadline had arrived and I hadn’t sent anything in yet. Quickly, I filled out the online form, hoping for the best and wishing I wasn’t such a procrastinator. I was excited to find out a week later that I had been accepted, and when I arrived at the Hub, I found that everyone I spoke to had applied the day of the deadline. Are all creatives prone to procrastination? This weekend there would be no time to waste. With only 48 hours to complete our task of helping seven impact ventures communicate their stories, we would need to brainstorm and execute our ideas quickly and efficiently. It all started on Friday night, when we were assigned to our groups and Saturday morning the real work would begin. I was assigned to work with Investment Ready, a program that helps entrepreneurs from central and eastern Europe create scalable solutions for global programs. I was inspired by the work they were doing. However with such a broad target group, it was challenging to convey the work Investment Ready was doing in a succinct and personable way. It was up to me and the others in my group to find a solution. We all know that group projects are not always easy… Recently a friend of mine sent me a cartoon that read, “When I die, I want my group project members to lower me into the grave… so they can let me down, one last time.” Slightly morbid, I know, but I couldn’t help but laugh as I recalled the many group project experiences of my academic and professional career. I’m happy to say that my Hackathon team took group project work to a new level. The Investment Ready Program group was an international dream team coming from Russia, Czech Republic, Germany, the US and Austria. We had a film maker, a creative director, a web designer, a graphic designer, and a journalist. Everyone was totally engaged and ready to do their best work. Countless brainstorming sessions, discussions, and cups of coffee later, the first day was over. And we still had nothing! Ok, not ‘nothing.’ We had plenty of ideas, but had yet to create any concrete outputs. The pressure was on and day two was going to be hard. Fast forward to Sunday afternoon and we were wrapping up our video shoot. Who knew we were all such great actors? Well, maybe we won’t be winning any Oscars soon, but we certainly enjoyed ourselves. In the end we managed to create and finish all of our deliverables in the final three hours leading up to the deadline. When time was up, we went straight into the showcase. Positive energy seemed to surge throughout the building as each group presented the amazingly creative, funny, beautiful and clever solutions they had created to solve their start-up’s communication problem. As I watched the presentations from the other groups, I realized that all of the teams were international dream teams! Creating websites, videos, print and photography campaigns, each group had produced an incredible amount of outputs given the intensive 48 hour deadline. Overall, the weekend was an amazing experience for me. I have never met so many engaged, passionate, creative and hardworking people in one place.

We are already giving away an MBA scholarship, so we thought why not give you some tips from an expert on how to help you make the perfect application video. So get ready to take some notes. But first let’s start from the beginning. Impact Hub Vienna is giving members the chance to win a fully-funded scholarship worth 25,000 Euros for an MBA (Master of Business Administration) at MODUL University Vienna. You can find all the details on our website, but one thing you need to know is that you need to make an application video. Say what?! Take a deep breath and relax, because we are going to coach you through it with the help of our in house filmmaker extraordinaire – Filippo Rezzadore. With more than 8 years in the industry, Filippo was full of tips and tricks for those newbie filmmakers. Planning is key Write down what you want to communicate. Who you are making the video for and what the main points you want to get across? Structuring and planning the video around these points is key for a successful end result. Think about sound There is nothing worse than a great video with terrible sound quality. Filippo suggests choosing a quiet place without an echo. Try to use a room with furniture, and a carpet if possible, to absorb the sound. Shoot in a clear and simple frame And what does that mean exactly? Keep what the viewer sees (the frame) as simple and clean as possible. Keep the subject (you) in focus and move everything else to the background, so that it doesn’t distract the viewer. Avoid projecting shadows on the background by using natural or side lighting and never use front lighting. You don’t need the latest equipment Don’t worry about running out to buy the latest camera – your smartphone will be fine. Stabilise it by propping your smartphone up against a book, shelf or lamp. Or simply ask if someone can help you keep it in place. Remember to avoid the selfie video. That format is not suitable for your application video. Short and simple statements. Don’t use long sentences and complex vocabulary to impress the judges. Keep you sentences simple to ensure that you speak clearly and concisely. And with those tips fresh in our mind, we are ready to start filming. Thanks for your words of wisdom Filippo! And to those applicants out there: the deadline is June 30th, 2016, so get filming!

We’ve been following Billie, one of the newest members of Impact Hub Vienna, as she explores how to get the most out of her Impact Hub membership. Billie is a social entrepreneur based out of Vienna, passionate about creating positive change and inspired by other like minded people. You can check out her first blog post to get better acquainted. Billie was getting a little tired of the falafel and schnitzel she had been eating for lunch and was searching for some brain food to keep her fingers typing and her mind sharp. Craving something healthy for lunch, she jumped at the chance to join the Sexy Salad on Tuesday. Eating a sexy salad while meeting fellow Hubbers? She was totally in. Fast Recap: What is Sexy Salad? A weekly gathering where Hub-Members and guests prepare salad together and share a meal, while getting to know one another better. Where does it take place? At the kitchen of Impact Hub Vienna on the 1st floor. When is this sexiness happening? Every Tuesday. We start preparing at 12:00pm and the real (m)eating starts at 12:30pm. Around 1:30pm the washing machine will be turned on and the and work keeps going on and on. Why should you attend? To have a healthy lunch. To meet and connect with like minded individuals. To introduce yourself and share your impact story that brought you to the table. To feel creative by making your own sexy salad. Billie’s personal Sexy Salad adventure: Tuesday morning, fingers typing, the host approached me. I was listening to music and couldn’t hear what he said. But thanks to my expert lip reading skills, I interpreted, ‘’Will you join me sexy madam?’’ Huh? Me…? Sexy…? With this bad hair day…? Taking off my headphones, he repeated, “Will you join the sexy salad?” Ha! Of course. A sexy salad. “So, are you joining?” he asked again. I’m new here and had no idea about Sexy Salad. He explained that Sexy Salad is one of the Weeklies, also known as the community co-created lunch. People bring their veggies/salad ingredients and prepare them together with other members or visitors. I quickly weighed my options: sandwich over my laptop or delicious community inspired salad. The decision was not challenging and I immediately wanted to join in. One tiny problem though: I didn’t have any veggies to contribute! No worries there, reassured the host. He was going to the market to buy some ingredients and I only needed to contribute a few Euros! So I chopped, washed, cooked, laughed, set the table, ate, and made some new friends. Wait a minute, it’s Tuesday again! Maybe I’ll see you there! Billie is on her way to Sexy Salad! You coming with? Tips: Be proactive about meeting new people! If you are interested in Sexy Salad you don’t have to sign up, just come to the host with your veggies and say Hi! If you are a newcomer, like Billie, let the host know, so we can have a short round of introductions. If you have no cooking skills don’t worry…the only recipe you need is your imagination!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/06/02/money-money-money/","ImpactHub","Money, Money, Money","Money. While the topic might make some of us squirm in our seats, it is an important topic to address when starting a business. Here at Impact Hub Vienna we dont shy away from this sensitive topic. Whether developing sustainable business models with the help of our Accelerate Program or finding and preparing for investment with the Investment Ready Program, we guide our ventures through the whole process. At the core of all of this is Impact Investment. But what is Impact Investing? Impact Investing is… an investment approach that intentionally seeks to create both financial return and positive social and/or environmental impact that is actively measured. (Taken from a Charly Kleissner slide showed at last years CEE Impact Day) Social businesses are not the only ones with money concerns. Over 40% of households in the Eurozone are in debt and we have some dedicated Hub members addressing this issue. Working in different regions of the financial sector, Three Coins, Franz Karl Prüller, Charly Kleissner, and Erste Bank pack a pretty powerful punch when it comes to addressing financial issues. Three Coins Three Coins is developing educational tools and formats to promote responsible personal finance. The team comprises of experts in education, social sciences, economics and entrepreneurship. Three Coins aims its efforts at people with so-called “open learning windows”, who welcome personal finance tips and are open to new input. This includes, youth in professional training or transitioning into adulthood, newly self-employed workers, young parents, people with immigrant backgrounds, young adults. Three Coins participated in Impact Hub Vienna programs, including the Investment Ready Program and they pitched at the very first CEE Impact Day 5 years ago. Franz Karl Prüller Franz Karl Prüller, chairman of the board at the Erste Foundation, believes Social Entrepreneurship is ‘the most sensible thing you can do for society.’ Before taking over as chairman of the board, he was the director of the Social Development Programme from 2005 until 2013. Charly Kleissner Dr. Charly Kleissner is an impact investor and impact entrepreneur. He is a co-founder of the KL Felicitas Foundation. Their mission is to enable social entrepreneurs and enterprises worldwide to develop and grow sustainably. He is also on the board of Toniic, the global action community for impact investors. He helped found the 100% Impact Network, a global peer-to-peer network of asset owners, who have intentionally committed 100% of their assets to positive social and/or environmental impact. Also he helped co-found the Central European Investment Ready Program, which helps social entrepreneurs worldwide to accelerate and increase their social impact. He is dedicated to investment and supporting social entrepreneurs and will be present at the upcoming CEE Impact Day where attendees can meet, talk and learn from him. Nikolaus Hutter Nikolaus Hutter is the founder of New Paradigm Ventures (Impact Investment, Capacity Building, and Prototype New Business). He has also been actively involved with Impact Hub Vienna and our programs for over 4 years, as a coach and mentor. With a wealth of experience, he is always willing to offer advice with regards to business development and impact investment. He believes that, ‘in the future, as an entrepreneur or investor, you either create genuine value – financial, social, and environmental – or go out of business.’ Erste Bank It may be surprising to many people that Erste Bank is an Impact Hub Vienna member, they have been since 2012! The Erste Foundation, which is associated with Erste Bank, aims to unite Europe, into a social, cultural and economic area without borders, with all its diverse natural beauty, individualism and identities. They do this by investing in lasting structures and relationships, they reinforce individual and organisational autonomy, they cooperate on an equal footing, they take joint responsibility for the common good. The Erste Foundation believes that a prosperous community provides the basis for social, individual and economic development. Erste Bank have supported the CEE Impact Day over the past few years and this year the CEO, Andreas Treichl, will be present at the upcoming event Impact Investment at Impact Hub Vienna The upcoming CEE Impact Day is at the heart of the Impact Investment Ecosystem in the CEE region. It brings together 100+ international impact investors, key stakeholders and selected ventures since 2012. This year, the 5th anniversary, promises to be an exciting and inspiring event. To celebrate the five years there will be five exceptional key speakers: Dr Charly Kleissner – Toniic, 100% IMPACT, KL Felicitas Foundation Uli Grabenwarter – European Investment Fund Cyril Gouiffes – European Investment Fund Ewa Konczal – EVPA (European Venture Philantropy Association) Andreas Treichl – Erste Foundation, #gallery-0 { margin: auto; } #gallery-0 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 32%; } #gallery-0 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-0 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } $(document).ready(function() { /* * Simple image gallery.

Wenn man sich ihren Lebenslauf ansieht, so könnte man meinen, dass Cornelia schon mit 18 wusste, dass Sie unverschwendet gründen wird. Als gelernte Köchin studierte Cornelia Diesenreiter zuerst “Recht und Wirtschaft” in Salzburg. Auf Grund Ihrer persönlichen Werte von Verantwortung und Nachhaltigkeit und der Liebe zur Natur, hat sie dann “Umwelt- und Bioressourcenmanagement” an der BOKU in Wien, sowie “Design und Innovation for Sustainability” in England studiert, wo Cornelia ihre Liebe für das Konzept von Zero Waste entdeckt hat. In unverschwendet hat sie dann die Erfüllung gefunden. unverschwendet steht für kulinarischen Genuss als Lösungsansatz um unnötige Lebensmittel-Verschwendung zu verhindern. Durch traditionelle Verfahren wie Einkochen und Einlegen werden aus überschüssigen, jedoch stets qualitativ hochwertigen und frischen Früchten, Gemüse und Kräutern, in liebevoller Handarbeit Produkte wie Fruchtaufstriche, Gelees, Sirupe und Chutneys hergestellt. Cornelia, wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für´s Kochen entdeckt? Meine Oma und meine Mama sind exzellente Köchinnen und ich war schon als Kind immer begeisterte Küchenhelferin bei ihnen. Kochen ist für mich etwas sehr Sinnliches und Meditatives. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Im Rahmen meines Studiums “Design and Innovation for Sustainability” habe ich bei einem Zero Waste Projekt an einer Restmüllanalyse teilgenommen, bei der wir 1,5 Tonnen Restmüll in Kategorien aufgeteilt haben. Ich war absolut schockiert, als ich realisiert habe, dass davon 400 kg Lebensmittel waren, teilweise noch einwandfrei genießbar. Ich liebe Lebensmittel und habe nach diesem Erlebnis meine beiden Masterarbeiten zum Thema Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung geschrieben. Was war vorher? Das Kochen oder die Idee mit überschüssigen Gemüse und Früchten etwas zu tun? Kochen und Lebensmittel waren für mich immer schon eine absolute Leidenschaft, die ich sowohl beruflich auch als privat gelebt habe. Die Idee mit dieser Leidenschaft einen Beitrag zu einer Zero Waste Gesellschaft zu leisten, hat dann auch noch meine Liebe zur Umwelt eingebunden. Wo siehst Du dich mit „unverschwendet“ in einem Jahr? Ich hoffe, dass ich heuer mindestens 5 Tonnen Obst und Gemüse unverschwenden kann und sich das Konzept in Wien gut etabliert, damit ich dann in einem Jahr eine Zweigstelle in einer weiteren österreichischen Stadt eröffnen kann, um auch dort regional Obst und Gemüse unverschwenden zu können. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja, ich bin ein sehr neugieriger Mensch. Zusammenhänge und Kausalitäten, zum Beispiel in der Wertschöpfungskette von Lebensmittel faszinieren mich, da man so auch Synergien erkennen kann, wie man Ressourcen besser nutzen kann. Meine Neugierde zeigt sich aber vor allem in meinen ausgefallenen Rezeptkreationen, wie beispielsweise Wassermelone-Basilikum oder Rosmarin-Limette. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Als ich von England nach Österreich zurückgekommen bin, musste ich feststellen, dass es in diesem sehr wichtigen Bereich von Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung noch keine Jobs und nur sehr wenige Initiativen gibt, deshalb habe ich beschlossen mich mit unverschwendet selbstständig zu machen und ich bin sehr sehr glücklich über diese Entscheidung. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Köstlichkeiten, die sowohl Bauern und Bäuerinnen, als auch KonsumentInnen glücklich machen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Zu sehen, wie glücklich unverschwendet Menschen machen kann. Einerseits die Bauern und Bäuerinnen, weil sie nichts wegwerfen müssen und dann meine KonsumentInnen, die sich über eine so köstliche Lösung freuen und sie entweder selbst genießen, oder als Geschenk mit schöner Geschichte weitergeben. Ich persönlich bin am Glücklichsten, wenn ich in der Natur sein kann, in den Bäumen sitze und ernte. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Bruder Andreas, der sich mit vollem Einsatz und Hingabe darum kümmert, dass unverschwendet so wunderschön aussieht, wie es aussieht und mich bei Design, Strategie und wichtigen Entscheidungen unterstützt. Ich bin auch sehr glücklich über die vielen großartigen KooperationspartnerInnen die ich in Wien gefunden habe, mit denen ich gemeinsam an kreativen Projekten arbeiten kann. Z.B. die Wiener Tafel, gartenernte, palme13, Zero Waste Austria, … Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Jeder Tag ist ein Abenteuer und es tun sich laufend so viele neue Möglichkeiten auf, dass ich selbst nur staunen kann und ich bin selbst gespannt, wo mich meine Arbeit noch hinbringen wird, ich freue mich jedenfalls sehr darauf! Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Lebensmittel und vor allem die Vermeidung von Lebensmittelverschwendung ist ein sehr emotionales Thema, da die meisten Menschen das unangenehme Schuldgefühl kennen, wenn sie Lebensmittel wegwerfen müssen, deshalb spricht meine Geschichte viele Menschen an und ich denke, dass man meine Leidenschaft dafür einfach spüren kann und das steckt an. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Ich habe das große Glück, dass die Menschen in meinem Umfeld sehr begeistert sind von meinem Projekt und mich unterstützen wo sie können, dafür bin ich sehr sehr dankbar! Hast Du einen Wunsch? Ich würde mir wünschen, dass ich mit Unverschwendet einen wirklich nachhaltigen Beitrag zur Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung in Österreich und vielleicht sogar irgendwann in Europa leisten kann. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Eine meiner Lieblings Facebook Seiten ist Treehugger, die immer sehr inspirierende und kreative Projekte vorstellen, die unsere Welt ein kleines Stück besser machen. www.unverschwendet.at","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spoonbanner-edit-600x400.jpg","June 8, 2016","de",0.999523282051086,4.59789553133305e-05,0.50936827249825,0.000193308231246192,0.490392431151122
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/06/15/deadlines-procrastination-planning/","ImpactHub","Plan Your Way Out Of Procrastination","5 common mistakes of effective planning (which you are probably making) So maybe you’re not the best at sticking to deadlines and quickly ticking things off your To Do list. But what if I told you I could help you become a time management master by correcting the 5 most common mistakes of effective planning? Yes, it sounds like we are about to serve you a magic potion, which will permanently cure procrastination, but to be honest, effective planning has very little to do with finding the cure for laziness and everything to do with learning how to properly plan. Ready for the big reveal? Here we go with 5 mistakes that will change the way you organize. #1 You Don’t Know How To Prioritize The art of prioritizing is simply a realistic evaluation measuring what needs to be done against the tasks’ level of importance. To keep it simple: the most important task goes on top. But sometimes it is hard to discern which task is actually ‘most important.’ When you have a deadline set by the client, then this task is the most important. When you have a paper to turn in, a newsletter to send, pieces of reports to put together, these are the most important tasks. Essentially, all deadline-dependent activities should be jotted down onto your To Do list as top priorities. It is also a good idea to get in the habit of setting daily, weekly, and monthly goals. You can organize these depending on the amount of effort that will go into the execution of these tasks. Ask yourself ‘What is my goal?’ and once you get that part down, start setting priorities by asking ‘Is this task bringing me closer to my goal? #2 Your Plate Is Too Full Ambition is the driving force behind many actions. But being overzealous, can become problematic when you load your planner with too many tasks. Multi-tasking is a myth and bloodshot eyes are not sexy. #3 Know Yourself The golden rule of following through on your commitments is to be realistic. Would you ever run a marathon without prior experience in running? Would you apply for a CEO position straight out of university? My point exactly. Effective planning means knowing what you are capable of and how much work you need to put in to reap the benefits. Consider the time the entire task should take. Also remember to set yourself a deadline otherwise you will fall into delays and procrastination! Consider how many stages the task has and how much work/time you need to spend on each task. For example, I need to take pictures for the blog post and edit them, write the post, proofread it, and plan post promotion. Consider the resources needed for the job – is my camera working and are the batteries charged? Do I have enough information about the product? #4 You’re Using The Wrong Tools For Planning There is no such thing as ‘a bad way of planning’ because each of us has a unique approach to their organizational system. For some it is a paper notepad, for others Google Calendar is their go to planner. Which method do you use? Ask yourself honestly if your organization pattern has been satisfactory. Are your planning tools fulfilling all the functions or are you still searching for your perfect planning method? Without proper tools, you will find yourself in a situation where you will have crumpled notes with To Do lists, hastily written during your morning shopping trip. #5 The Destination Is Not Exciting Enough So you nailed down your tools, priorities, and assessed the tasks, but something still isn’t working. If success is still eluding you, then planning might not be your main problem. The lingering problem in this case might be your goals. Perhaps your goals are not thrilling enough for you to really go for them. That means its time to rethink your goals or include an incentive. Maybe you are lost under a pile of work and don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Adding progress monitoring to your To Do list might help. I guarantee you that seeing how much you have achieved will provide the perceived value of what you’re doing and spur you on. As somebody smart once said ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail’. What they forgot to add is ‘Failing to recognise the right way of planning makes the whole exercise pointless’. And you can quote us on this.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/planningheader-600x400.jpg","June 15, 2016","en",0.996923327445984,0.0499350242316723,0.589115917682648,0.0480661690235138,0.31288281083107
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/06/22/roman-firnkranz-smoothie-king/","ImpactHub","Roman Firnkranz: Smoothie King","Roman Firnkranz kommt aus Hollabrunn in Niederösterreich. Vor 6 Jahren hat es Roman dann nach Wien verschlagen. Es war ein langer Weg bis er seine Leidenschaft gefunden hat. Nach 12 Jahren als ambitionierter Fußballer und seinem ersten Traum Fußballprofi zu werden, hängte er mit 20 Jahren seine Fußballschuhe an den Nagel und folgte seinem zweiter Traum – professioneller Computerspieler. In dem umstrittenen Egoshooter Counterstrike wollte Roman um die Welt reisen und dabei Geld verdienen. Auch hier hat es nicht ganz geklappt und er hängte die Maus nach 6 Jahren an den Nagel. Sein dritter Traum war selbstbestimmt sowie ortsunabhängig zu arbeiten und dabei etwas Gutes für die Menschen zu tun. Dazu hat er seine Leidenschaften Social Media, Online Marketing und Ernährung miteinander kombiniert. Daraus ist jetzt eine der größten deutschsprachigen Grüne Smoothies & Säfte Plattformen mit knapp 100.000 Facebook Fans und 250.000 monatlichen Website-Besuchern entstanden. Grüne Smoothies sind der einfachste erste Schritt um seine Ernährung und seine Gesundheit zu verbessern. Sie bestehen nur aus Wasser, Pflanzengrün wie Salat oder Spinat und leckeren Früchten. Die beste “Erfindung” im 21. Jahrhundert! Was treibt Dich an? Ich liebe es kreativ zu sein und viele neue Dinge auszuprobieren. Zum Beispiel interessiert mich im Moment das Thema Video sehr stark. Außerdem will ich etwas Gutes für die Menschen tun. Wenn man sich dabei in einem Thema bewegt, das einem seit langem interessiert und selbstbestimmt arbeiten kann, dann hat man den Jackpot geknackt! Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Grüne Smoothies entdeckt? Vor ungefähr 3 Jahren, als ich diese für mehrere Monate wirklich regelmäßig selbst getrunken habe. Du beschäftigst Dich ja schon sehr lange mit Fragen rund um Ernährung, wie ist dann der Fokus auf Smoothies, auf grüne Smoothies entstanden? Ich absolvierte im Jahr 2012/2013 eine Ausbildung zum Ernährungstrainer und war damals auf der Suche nach einem Thema für meine Diplomarbeit. Die grünen Smoothies sind es dann geworden, und am 1.1.2013 startete ich meine eigene 30-Tage-Grüne-Smoothies-Challenge, worüber ich täglich einen Blog verfasste. Daraus entstand dann eine Facebook Seite, welche ziemlich schnell wuchs, als ich täglich Beiträge veröffentlichte. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Der Auslöser war meine Diplomarbeit, aber ich widme mich erst seit einem Jahr zur Gänze meiner Zeit mit diesem Projekt. Wie ist eigentlich die Idee für Dein Buch entstanden? Meine Lektorin hat bei der 30-Tage-Challenge mitgemacht und mich danach angeschrieben. Das Buch ist ja sehr positiv aufgenommen worden? Wie hat das Dein Leben verändert? Überhaupt nicht, außer dass noch mehr E-Mails eintrudeln. Ich bin noch immer derselbe Mensch. Selbst am Bankkonto hat sich nichts verändert, weil die Provisionen erst sehr spät ausgezahlt werden. Wo siehst Du dich mit „grüne Smoothies“ einem Jahr? Mein Fokus wird sich im kommenden Jahr auf meine Namensmarke “Roman Firnkranz” sowie die komplette Ernährung verlagern. Das Projekt “Grüne Smoothies & Säfte” bleibt weiterhin bestehen, aber nach 3 Jahren habe ich mal wieder Lust auf mehr Abwechslung. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Indem ich viel ausprobiere, sehr viel Neues lerne und es gerne auch selbst mache. Zum Beispiel Food-Fotografie, Videos drehen vor und hinter der Kamera oder Bücher schreiben. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? In Österreich geboren zu sein, Zugang zu kostenloser Bildung, Büchern und Google zu haben. Ohne diesen Voraussetzungen wäre ich nicht da, wo ich jetzt wäre. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Es hatte das größte Potential, machte mir am meisten Spaß und es war eine Herausforderung. Ich wollte es unbedingt durchziehen und etwas Vorzeigbares schaffen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es dich nicht geben würde? Die Menschen hätten 200 – 400 Tonnen mehr auf der Wage <U+0001F642> Also mit diesem Juni haben über 100.000 Menschen an meinen Challenges teilgenommen, wobei hier jeder im Durchschnitt 2 – 4 kg abnimmt.

She might be a little smaller than the other Hub Members you meet, but she doesn’t let that stop her passion for creating positive change through her new social venture here in Vienna. To get better acquainted, you can check out her earlier blog posts here. Last week Billie was scrolling through her Facebook profile, hoping to find someone to connect with about her new social venture. After an hour of searching for the right community, she realized she didn’t have as much in common with her Facebook friends as she thought. Sitting back in her comfy desk chair, she wished she could find a platform that could connect her with like minded people, people building up social ventures of their own. Billie’s wish came true almost instantly, as she discovered HubNet! Fast Recap: What is HubNet? It is Impact Hub’s network, the place where 10.632 Hub-Members across the world connect with each other and are able to share their experiences, ideas, and resources. Most importantly, everyone on HubNet shares their ventures and projects with their fellow Hubbers. But how do you HubNet? Step 1: Introduce yourself Who are you and what brought you to the Hub community? What are you working on and what are your future plans and goals? Don’t forget to link your HubNet to your other online presence (personal/company website, LinkedIn profile, Twitter account, Instagram). As you develop your profile, other Hubbers have key information that can help you accelerate your business and empower your vision. Step 2: Smile Show us those pearly whites and upload a profile pic. Your fellow Hubbers in Vienna want to know who you are and a picture enables them to recognize you instantly and ask questions about your projects. Step 3: It’s a group thing We are all about community here at Impact Hub so be sure to join the right groups based on your interests. You can search for groups using the search bar or go to the group directory. But what if your perfect niche group doesn’t exist? No problem! Just create a group; some of the other 10.000+ Hubbers might join. Master Tip: Start by joining the How-To HubNet group. This is a space for Hubbers to ask questions and troubleshoot ways to use the Hub Network. Step 4: Notification or Spamification? Be sure to edit your notification settings so you receive the right amount of information from your groups. Getting an information overload isnt sexy. Be sure to target the groups you want to receive updates from. Step 5: It’s a global thing HubNet is the network of global impact makers. By clicking at the home page you have an inside look at what Hubbers are up to around the world. Master Tip: If you are planning to travel abroad make sure to check here to see if there is an Impact Hub in that area.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/06/29/zero-food-waste-challenge/","ImpactHub","Zero Food Waste Challenge","Walking into the space, it feels like taking a piece of the past and fitting it perfectly into the present. The BROTFABRIK building in the 10th district has a beautiful façade. The bricks from the historical bread factory are interspersed with high arched windows, illuminating the high ceilinged interior spaces. Inside you can find beautiful galleries and you guessed, co-working spaces and social projects! The Zero Waste Lab is one such project. A pop-up space for events and workshops, they recently hosted a Zero Food Waste Panel. Organized by the design thinking group OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter, the event was a response to the current Zero Food Waste challenge which is being addressed by the global OpenIDEO network. OpenIDEO is a network of local communities using design thinking to drive social impact around the world. Starting in Singapore, the movement expanded to New York, Palo Alto and Barcelona in 2013. The movement was sparked by a question from the OpenIDEO design community: why aren’t we leveraging the power of face-to-face connection? Since then 40+ cities across the world have joined the global community. Members meet up locally to contribute to online challenges such as the Zero Food Waste challenge, flex design thinking muscles, and participate in workshops to launch social impact projects. The Zero Food Waste panel had a great line up staring three women who are passionate about addressing food waste issues. Alexandra, Helene and Cornelia (from left to right) The first panelist was Alexandra Gruber, who is the managing director of Wiener Tafel, a Viennese not-for-profit association that operates at the intersection of zero food waste and poverty reduction in Vienna. The second panelist was Helene Pattermann, the founder and initiator of Zero Waste Austria, which aims to connect and strengthen zero waste players on- and offline. Through Zero Waste Austria she raises awareness on the topic and gives the zero waste movement a voice. Most recently she has also been organising the pop-up Zero Waste Lab, where the event was hosted. Finally, Cornelia Diesenreiter rounded out the panelists for the evening. Cornelia is the founder of Unverschwendet a social business following a simple, yet effective idea. With her start-up, she saves vegetables and fruits from being wasted by cooking and selling marmalade, chutneys and other products. That way she is able to save tons of eatable food. During the enlightening one and a half hour discussion, Stephan Kardos from the OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter led the group through a series of questions aimed at delving deeper into the topic of Zero Food Waste. Food waste is no easy problem to solve, and the participants walked in already familiar with this critical issue. What struck as particularly surprising, however, was some of the data the panelists referred to when touching on the scope of waste taking place. Cornelia had some interesting insights into the scope with which we are dealing with. “I get phone calls from farmers calling me, saying they have one ton of tomatoes every day.” She explained that she wished she could do more to save the food being wasted. “Its just my capacity, it’s the logistics behind it. It’s too much. And the numbers, they strike me everyday…Its not every now and then. Its every day that I get these phone calls.” Alexandra also had some impressive numbers to share with the group. “Currently we [process] 500 tons of food on a yearly basis, and we serve about 100 charities, with about 18,000C people living in poverty…We could do more, but we would have to enlarge our capacities. For us, our next step is having a warehouse.” The coordination involved, and all the drop and pick up sites, are also limiting factors for the Weiner Tafel. Alexandra expressed wanting to do more, but same as with Cornelia, the logistics posed problems for her organization. Elena, supporting the previous panelists, said that, “one third of the food we buy goes to waste.” She pointed out that it is not only the food that is wasted, “its the money, the time, and the effort. There is a lot of potential in households to reduce food waste.” Keeping those numbers in mind, there was a poll taken of what food items the audience threw out most often from their homes. The results from the poll revealed that audience members threw away fruit and vegetables the most, with 11 participants falling into this category. Stale bread was a close runner up, with 8 participants reporting this as their most tossed food item at home. And finally meat and dairy were also reported as commonly wasted food items, with 3 and 2 participants weighing in respectively. Panelists and OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter Organizers Colorful post-its covering the wall, audience members could see the results of the poll. During the networking session that followed the panel, there was some discussion as to how people could save the food they usually tossed at home. Full of new ideas and inspired by the incredible work the panelists are doing, audience members left the Zero Waste pop-up armed with useful links, tips and tricks on how to reduce food waste in their lives. What food item do you most commonly waste in your home and is there a way you could share or reuse it?","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/header-2-600x400.jpg","June 29, 2016","en",0.994969308376312,0.000835076993098482,0.36367018148303,0.025640520703746,0.609854236245155

It is true – Fundacity, the website that connects investors to Start- Ups, told us so! And do you know what makes Impact Hub Vienna so special? Part of the answer is the Accelerator Program and Workshops. What is an Accelerator Workshop? Are you missing a key skill to move your venture forward? Do you want to dust off a previously honed skill by learning new tips and tricks? If so, then the Accelerator Workshops are for you! As part of the workshop program industry experts present a variety of tools, tips, and tricks to help get you and your venture to the next level. They are a great way to network with industry professionals and to connect with your fellow Hubbers. To learn more about the Accelerate Program and Workshops, click here. Communications for Start-Ups As a part of a recent Accelerator Workshop, Dirk Moser and Elisabeth Totschnig of Grayling Austria, pictured above, came to Impact Hub Vienna and gave workshop participants the inside track on communications strategies. Communication strategies for large or small organizations all boil down to two simple questions: What is my message and who am I trying to reach? The answers to these two questions often determine what you are communicating about your business and yourself, how you will communicate with your clients, and where they will see your message. Below are some tips to help you create a solid communications strategy. Persona Approach Take some time to imagine your clients. What do they look like? Where do they work? How do they like to spend their weekends? Once you have the answers to those questions, look more closely at the details of your imagined clients’ lives. In contemplating this you can often find the answers to when they might use your products and when might be the ideal time and formats for your communications. Use Social Media According to Grayling’s data, 4 in 10 customers are more likely to make a purchase after sharing it or favouriting it on social media sites. These numbers look great, especially when you are trying to make an impact with your venture. However, there is a downside to social media: the time that it takes to maintain the content on each site. Be brave enough not to start something – Elisabeth Totschnig A social media site with no developed content for a lengthy period of time detracts from your ability to market your product or service to your clients. From your clients’ perspectives you have stopped talking with them and the relationship degrades. Remember to only take on as much as you can handle and not to overload yourself (or your team mates!). Always Ask Asking people to review a product or service seems awkward and false for many of us. However, 71% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase based on social media referrals. This statistic shows that we should be soliciting reviews of our products and services for our social media sites. We often forget that we have a massive network at our fingertips in HubNet or in person at Impact Hub Vienna. Our colleagues in Vienna and across the world are always very willing to help with your product and service. What Next? When workshop participants were asked what they would start doing the next day as a result of the workshop the most common answer was developing client personas to better target their messaging and their communications strategies. What are you going to do next to help accelerate your venture? We would suggest signing up for the next workshop!

Anything bad is good for you – if we develop the ability and agility to see challenges as investment opportunities and tackle them though impact investing and social entrepreneurship. The CEE Impact Day at Impact Hub Vienna has given strong evidence of this new nascent market paradigm. While the social welfare state has been a successful concept to address the challenges of the 20th century, social entrepreneurship and impact investing may well be the recipe of the 21st century. While many old systems are running dry of money and need to reinvent themselves or die, the movement building works undertaken by pioneers like Charly Kleissner , Impact Hubs, Ashoka and the Social Stock Exchange- to name a few, begin a to win momentum. New forms of co-operation, co-work and a new language are proliferating into investment and social banking. Social Banking and Impact Investing uses the nowadays highly sophisticated instruments developed in investment banking like social bonds, green bonds and pay – for – performance schemes and new intermediaries like the social stock exchange alongside with a strong focus on creating solutions for social and environmental challenges, the world is facing today. The Impact Hub has a centre role in establishing the fertile ground these new potentials. Some examples of how these Social Enterprises can be profitable were presented as award winners at the CEE Impact Day. I have picked Magdas Hotel, a hotel run by 20 refugees and 10 professionals addressing the challenge of migrants to find work. The hotel is a rebuild retirement home, offers rooms in a chilly atmosphere and at the same time a wide range of cultural events. A lot of players support this new field of enterprising and investing like Erste Bank Foundation who has co- initiated the first Social Bond in Austria, Impact Hub who runs various programmes in cooperation with partners like the Investment Ready Programme (IRP) and the Scaling Programme to mane a few. The CEE Impact Day provided strong evidence on how successful the Hub has been in establishing a new eco-system for triple bottom line and impact investing and that it has been a change agent and enabler for social entrepreneurship, NBO and Tec’s. I differentiate the two by the indicator whether or not a sound theory of change is applied. Triple bottom line investment does not necessarily imply a theory of change, impact investment does. Charly Kleissner, Co-Founder of KL Felicitas Foundation reiterated and emphasized the importance of the movement building works in addition to a TBL approach in investing, which needs to go on with investees, investors and intermediaries and develop increased attraction and buy in. Charly himself once again demonstrated in his speech that he is an excellent ambassador, supporter and campaigner for impact investing and social entrepreneurship and announced that he will make available his portfolios for scientific research on impact investing to universities and scientists. Uli Grabenwarter, Deputy Director Equity Investments of the European Investment Fund stressed “ we have to hold ourselves (investors) responsible for the success of impact investees and do everything to support them.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blog-Image-Guide-2-1-600x400.jpg","July 6, 2016","en",0.99181854724884,0.0011000968515873,0.705017149448395,0.00124318478628993,0.292639583349228
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/07/getting-started-linkedin/","ImpactHub","Getting started with Linkedin","You probably must have heard that recently Linkedin was acquired by Microsoft, which prompted a lot of people to dust off their Linkedin profiles to be ready for whatever revelation tech giant has in store for the platform. But Linkedin should be your key networking tool regardless of who owns it- with 433 million users, Linkedin is currently the biggest social media platform for professionals in the world. In other words: this is where your future bosses, clients and business partners are. And we will help you join them with this ‘Getting started with Linkedin’ introduction. Why do I need a Linkedin profile? Every time somebody asks me this question, my answer is instantaneous: because without Linkedin you will miss out on being offered a job or finding a new customer base. Whilst in Germany, Austria and Switzerland an alternative networking platform called Xing has a much bigger market share, key international companies and the rest of the world use Linkedin.That alone should get you seriously thinking about joining it! Starting your Linkedin journey When you log into your account will be greeted by a simple layout with user-friendly menu and a clean information feed providing you with recent updates from your network. There is also a small box sat in between menu and the feed, which includes a snippet of your profile analytics and three buttons for quick sharing of updates, photos, and article publishing. Many people like to think of Linkedin as ‘Facebook for professionals’ but the update feed should never be treated the same way. Remember that whilst Facebook is your personal social media, on Linkedin, you are showing your business face. Photos of pugs, albeit extremely cute, will not do. Let’s click through to your actual profile. Unlike any other network, Linkedin requires you to fill in a lot of personal information to boost your profile to an all-star level. This mystical ranking tool not only reminds you what needs to be done to get your profile up to speed- it also rewards you back with increasing your organic visibility in searches. Not to mention that a well-kept Linkedin profile will work to your advantage when people visit it. You can read more about benefits of taking your profile to the next level here. First of all, before you start making any changes to your profile, make sure you turn off ‘Notify your network’ option. To do so, go to your profile and scroll down to see the last box on the right-hand side panel – there will be a switch asking you whether you want your network notified of any updates to your profile. Select ‘No’. As said previously, Linkedin is an extension of your CV. Having an updated CV can give you an idea of what you want to put into your online profile and what you can add extra to to maximize on the Linkedin features. The basics: Profile picture– Use a professional photo rather than a blurred selfie. The ideal photo size is 400×400 pixels. Your headline – This is the title showing under your name at the top of your profile. I have seen users adding in their official job titles, as well as ‘Social Media Wizard’. Always use keywords that describe your job accurately because the headline is searchable and is attached to your name whenever you interact on Linkedin users- make sure it sums up your job at a first glance. Location and Industry – These two options will help Linkedin classify you into categories when somebody searches for, let’s say digital marketers in Vienna. Having current location listed on your profile also means people reaching out to you to offer you local opportunities. Unique URL -Instead of having a random string of numbers and letters, you can customize your URL to include your name and surname. Summary – This box containing maximum 2000 characters is your elevator pitch. Introduce yourself the way you would during a networking event. This particular section allows you to add media (presentation, video, links, visual etc.) so if you want, you can make it interactive. Experience – This is where you will input your professional or work related experience. You can either opt for chronological order or prepare a skill-based portfolio. The same CV rules apply here: be concise, provide results and statistics, use keywords, add media and space chunks of text so it is easier to digest. You can also upload media (video, link, document) and showcase your work visually. Education Languages – Aside from listing languages you can speak, it is also possible to demonstrate your language knowledge by having a duplicate Linkedin profile in that particular language. To do so, click on the black arrow next to the ‘View profile as’ blue button on your profile and select option ‘Create profile in another language’. Go beyond the basic Completing the minimum profile requirements above will be a start, but the more information you include, the closer you get to an all-star profile.To get to that level, you will have to be a bit more generous when it comes to sharing details of any additional education, experience, projects as well as causes you care about. Only 51% Linkedin profiles are completed, so going beyond the basic gives you a competitive advantage. Volunteering Publications– Extremely useful section for researchers and scientists. Projects– If you finished a team project at work or did a small job and do not feel like including it in your work experience, add it to this section. Bonus: you can add members of the team as long as they are your connections on Linkedin. Skills and Endorsements– Your connections can endorse you for certain skills you have added to your profile and you can endorse them back. More about endorsements below. Interests Awards Certifications Being active on Linkedin Once you have your profile filled in, start participating in the community!The most important reason you are on Linkedin to start off with is to connect with people. You can connect with your current and previous co-workers, colleagues, friends, and schoolmates. The more people in your network the wider your circle of 2nd and 3rd-degree connections is, which leads to higher ranking amongst other specialists in the same field. Start from building a base of people you have already met and worked with, ask for references to improve your own profile and seek new potential contacts. You should join groups of professionals within your industry – not only you can get insight on the type of work you do from colleagues abroad, but you can also explore work opportunities in international markets. This could also be a way of showing your expertise and earning credibility within your industry- by belonging to a specialised group, you dig deeper into your industry and create a net of things you have in common with other professionals. To find relevant select ‘Interests’ on the main menu and then ‘Groups’. Linkedin allows you to explore groups from the same industry based on your profile’s information -this is why it is better to complete the profile before you start socialising. Endorsements of skills is also a great way of keeping in touch with your network. Whilst endorsements are not as credible as references, they are an innocent poke aimed at your contacts to remind them of your existence. Chances are, that the person you endorsed will visit your profile back. Well done! You have just taken your first step towards owning an awesome Linkedin profile.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/08/an-impact-ful-day/","ImpactHub","An Impact-ful day","What an incredible day! Each year, the CEE Impact Day gathers global organisations, individual and institutional investors, and selected ventures to explore the growing investment opportunities in the Central and Eastern European region. This year was the 5th anniversary and approximately 120 new and established players gathered at Impact Hub Vienna to participate. It was a unique opportunity for all participants to interact on a one-to-one basis. Everyone was in a celebratory and positive mood when the day kicked off. The keynote speeches We started with Uli Grabenwarter from the European Investment Fund who spoke about the disconnect between traditional investment and impact investment. Uli believes that today, profit is not enough and that investors are also looking for businesses that will give back to society. Investors see these organisations as having a competitive advantage. To this end, impact investment is an enabler and a means to establishing a new way of conducting business that actually serves society. “Venture philanthropy is about matching the soul of philanthropy with the spirit of investing.” This visionary statement was how Ewa Konzcal from the European Venture Philanthropy Association (EVPA) opened her keynote speech. For the EVPA, it is all about matching funding with the right venture. They believe that the ventures (and investors) are out there, but that the connection is missing. EVPA likes to ask ventures – “What would you do if you had all the resources and money to make your dream happen?” – and then set about making this dream happen for them. Cornelius Pietzner from Alterra Impact Finance talked about how there is more to investing than just projections and plans. For him, it is about telling a story and understanding WHY the ventures do what they do, how they interact, their hopes, dreams and feelings. He believes that these things can tell you more about a venture than a 5 year projection. The breakout sessions After this inspirational start we broke into the first of 2 interactive sessions, where participants both learned from, and contributed to, the conversation. A range of impactful business topics were discussed and debated. Participants weren’t shy about asking tough and relevant questions to experts that they would not otherwise have had access to. These groups talked about what investors really wanted and how important financial returns were to them. They discussed investor segments, including geographic location, risks with respects to financial returns and actual impact that they are interested in (education, sustainability, etc). This level of conversation would not have been possible without a facilitated event like CEE Impact Day and participants made sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Before breaking for lunch, we reconvened and groups were asked to give a quick 1 minute review of their session, forcing group representative to be succinct and to the point. By doing this, other participants were able to find out about the other sessions and follow up with any questions during the lunch break. Participants were also able to talk one-one-one with some of the social impact ventures working across Europe, including Robowunderkind, aWATTar, Compuritas and FragNebanan. After being revived by Iss Mich food, participants again broke into breakout sessions. The second round of topics were extremely interesting and participants were forced to choose between the following options: Climate change and sustainability Tech-4-Good Migration & Integration Agriculture and food Ecosystem in the Western Balkans A new feature this year was the inclusion of breakout sessions focused specifically on different regions in Central and Eastern Europe. The Western Balkans and Danube were each given their own breakout session with the aim of promoting investment in the region. These areas are seen as a new frontier for impact investing in Europe. After much debate I decided to attend the Migration & Integration session, which proved to be innovative and informative. We were given updates from a number of groups working in the field, including Magdas Hotel, Refugeeswork.at, younited Cultures and the Austrian Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs & Consumer Protection. All the other groups reported that their sessions were equally as good. The wrap up Everybody reconvened for the final session and participants got intimate – chairs were rearranged and everyone sat in a giant circle, with many people sitting on the floor. The session was hosted by Charly Kleissner of KL Felicitas Foundation and Toniic, who spoke about how far the sector had come and how much was still to be done. Charley then brought things back to an emotional perspective, rather than a financial and logical one. He asked the participants if they were doing what they loved – really loved – and doing it not just because it was successful. He talked about how it was important for all of us to grow in a sustainable way, meaning that the person AND the company could sustain this growth. One must achieve personal satisfaction to continue to grown their organisation. The room was then open for discussion and all participants were invited to give their feedback and opinions. The microphone was passed around and everyone was included and their opinion valued. It was a wonderfully unique opportunity for all in the room to take a holistic look at their career focus and goals. Then finally it was time to kick back, relax and let the learnings of the day sink in.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CEEID-Banner-600x400.jpg","July 8, 2016","en",0.995080828666687,0.000195712953427574,0.135436863638461,0.000270462813205086,0.864096999168396

DiploHack Vienna Diplohack Vienna brought together a number of different stakeholders within various communities to discuss the topic of the Refugee Crisis. With the support of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Diplohack brought together refugees, social entrepreneurs, politicians, policy makers and more to discuss and create technical solutions for some of the global challenges the refugee crisis has created. The winning team, made up of Impact Hub Vienna members and refugees, received a clickable prototype of their product and an invitation to Transparency Camp Europe 2016, in the Netherlands, to present their idea and collaborate further! Found! Found! is a new incubation program offered by Impact Hub Vienna, in partnership with Deloitte Future Fund. The vision of found!: “Creating new prospects for the future is essential for the successful integration of refugees. Thus, enabling integration into the Austrian labor market is of special importance. Only by having jobs, people are able to secure a livelihood for themselves and become integrated and productive parts of society.” This partnership with the Deloitte Future Fund is a key example of the importance of collaboration across sectors. It shows the importance of and the value that is created when individuals, teams, large corporations, or governing bodies, collaborate to tackle a challenge together. By joining forces it uses the strengths of each group while remedying some of the weaknesses. Chancen:Reich On June 29, 2016, Chancen:Reich and their partners, took over MuseumsQuartier to hold the first ever Austrian job fair for refugees. The job fair gave refugees and potential employers a chance to connect with and learn about each other. Refugees were able to learn about hiring process from individual employers and employers were able to learn about the rich tapestry of qualifications and experience within the refugee community. Chancen:Reich co-founders say that integration within the broader business community is essential as it creates opportunities for both businesses and displaced persons. Amongst the job fair partners hoping to make connections with qualified refugees were Erste Bank, Rotes Kreuz, Samariterbund, and almost fifty other participants. This collaboration between social entrepreneurs, their beneficiaries, large corporations, and government services has created an ecosystem in which refugees can gain access to well paid employment and businesses can gain new perspectives through hiring internationally qualified individuals. This is just the start. Over the past year we have made some positive steps in this direction, but we are really just at the start of the mountain. We have established some strong connections with Deloitte, The Kingdom of The Netherlands, and more, but there is still a long way to go. We want to collaborate more, we want to broaden the Impact Hub Ecosystem to include everyone from corporations to the beneficiaries. By doing this we can see the whole picture, then and only then, can we help facilitate the creation of long and lasting positive Impact which, after all, is what the Impact Hub Network is all about.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WE-Connect-Banner-600x400.jpg","July 8, 2016","en",0.995663106441498,0.000354569812770933,0.83488255739212,0.000608688860666007,0.16415411233902

These stories come from a diversity of people, who run their projects with passion and courage. Hub Members usually live and breathe their projects, so when they achieve success, they feel these successes as the life milestones. Milestones are important because they provide a sense of achievement and progress. Forward progress is one of the best motivations to continue on one’s path, especially during the challenging or unsure moments in ones career. Success stories are also the ones which encourage other people to keep walking their own chosen paths. That is why The Community Hosting Team, decided to establish the Success Board located on the first floor of Impact Hub Vienna. The Success Board The Community Hosts recently erected the Success Board as a response to the inspiration we saw take place when members share success stories, big or small. One person sharing their story had a domino effect, rippling throughout the whole community. We believe that success should be celebrated at the Hub regularly. Therefore we revealed the first successes on June 23rd as a part of the Hub’s Wine-Down. This soon to be repeated event presented the perfect opportunity to present our new Success Board. The Wine-Down is an event which connects (and re-connects) members by giving them an informal atmosphere to talk about their projects, lives, and – of course – their successes; while sharing a glass of wine. The Wine-Down The recent Wine-Down was a success as well; more than 80 members came to enjoy the get-together. In house foodies, IssMich surprised the crowd with their innovative shots, cocktails and lemonades. The ice breaker game, which involved a colored bracelet, enabled Hubbers to get to know one another in a quick and easy way. Judging by the smiles at the event, we can say that the first of the monthly Wine-Downs was a success. Be sure to check out the next one on the 21st of July! Stay Tuned! The Wine-Downs and the Success Board go hand in hand when celebrating member milestones. That is why, as a part of the regular Wine-Down program, we will be announcing recent community successes from the Success Board. Cheers to all the success stories happening in the Hub and click here to check out the details for the next event!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Windedown-Photo1-600x400.jpg","July 12, 2016","en",0.992885887622833,0.0047198892571032,0.417648077011108,0.000676627270877361,0.576955437660217
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/13/accelerate-sales/","ImpactHub","Accelerate: Sales","Recently, the Communications Team have been covering our various experiences in the Accelerate Workshops. We wanted to bring you the information first hand, in case you haven’t had time to go or haven’t really thought about it before. You can read our first post about the communication workshop and you can read the Accelerate Program on our website for a bit more information. Is Selling a talent, a skill, or a process? A few weeks ago Ondrej Gandel of Inventures EU gave a sales focused workshop at Impact Hub. Regardless of whether you are offering a product or a service, or something in-between, it never hurts to have a few good sales tips up your sleeve. Sales is a mix of talent, skill, and process. However, good sales people are comfortable asking other for money, having the courage to approach people, and innately knowing which whom to speak, according to Gandel. You need to see who is important in which part of the selling process! Ask yourself who is the person with whom you are speaking. Is she a manager, a product user, a customer? It is important to ask yourself: is just one person involved in the purchase, or do you need to influence other stakeholders in the organization too? Key Characteristics Good sales people have a variety of personal characteristics and skills sets. Below is a list of the most common traits that all good sales people share, according to Gandel. Do you see yourself here? – taking the initiative – listening – being positive – being resourceful – being passionate – being conscious – being alert – being respectful – being persistent – having the motivation to keep learning Sales Process Identify your target audience: Do your research! Make a list of organizations, influential people, and social media networks to target. Try to explore these and then figure a way out how to connect to them. Think about whom you know; and if needed, run some searches through your LinkedIn page and Facebook account. Do you see an entry point? Then it’s time to think about how to approach them. Remember, sales is not just about your product or service. You are engaging in sales whenever you are: – creating partnerships, – seeking investors, – hiring an employee, – selling to a retailer, – or whenever you undertake any activity that involve your brand. Identify key drivers: Gandel further outlines that sales are not something you can learn at the desk; you have to go and speak to people. He shares a curious idea: “They cannot tell you what they want. They however LOVE to talk about problems and that can give you the clues!” Then it is your turn to make sense of it, and figure out how what you are selling can respond to what’s driving your audience. Determine exactly what you are “selling”: Besides having a rough outline of what you are offering, Gandel urges you to learn as much about it as possible! He suggests talking to people of all sorts, from those who directly fall under your scope to people who are seemingly unrelated to what you are selling. Getting to know all about the issue you are responding to and the aspects of your product (or service) will lead you to build better argument and stronger convincing abilities to increase your Sales influence. Benefits: People respond to benefits. Period. Incorporate this as a center of your Sales strategy. Facing Opposition When you are encountering opposition, the best way to proceed is by following these steps below. LISTEN Demonstrate that you are interested and want to understand what the concern is. ACKNOWLEDGE Acknowledge the points that are rightly the matter, then express that you will work towards a solution. EXPLORE Profoundly explore concerns and think of solutions. RESPOND When you are sure you understood the objection and are ready to offer a solution – then respond. Final thoughts Gandel warns us that the internet makes today’s situation a bit misleading when it comes to Sales. Although there is a lot you can do online – he says, he still emphasizes the importance of actually going out and speaking to people. Asking around and finding out more about what your target audience needs, is the surest way you could improve your product or service to meet your consumer’s needs and your market goals. It is important not to mistake the number of ‘likes’ with the turnover – workshop participant. Gandel lastly outlines: being good in Sales is also “an ability to deal with discomfort”. We will get better with experience, but it is important to remain open, have the willingness to learn, and keep persevering.

Er hat an der Universität Innsbruck internationale Wirtschaftswissenschaften studiert und seinen Master in Volkswirtschaftslehre an der Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand abgeschlossen. Stefan hat einige Projekte in Süd- und Südostasien verfolgt und unter anderem die Machbarkeitsstudie für einen Technologiepark an der Pakistan-Austrian University verfasst. In Rahmen seiner Doktorarbeit an der Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien hat er im Bereich Open und User Innovation geforscht und v.a. mit Modellen experimentiert den Wissensaustausch mit Externen zu fördern. WhatAVenture hat es sich zum Ziel gemacht. Teams zu empowern ihre Geschäftsideen iterativ und nahe am Kunden zur Marktreife zu entwickeln. WhatAVenture hat dafür einen webbasierten Innovationsprozess entwickelt, der in sechs Schritten auf Basis einer strukturierten Validierung von der Idee bis zur Investmentreife führt. WhatAVenture hat in den letzten Jahren hierbei mehr als 600 Startups und etablierte Unternehmen in verschiedenen Industrien bei der Umsetzung ihrer Geschäftsideen unterstützt. Was treibt Dich an? Selbstständig zu sein motiviert mich. Es bedeutet für mich Raum zu haben, meine Gedanken und Ideen zu verwirklichen. Am Ende liegt mir aber v.a. der gesellschaftliche Auftrag am Herzen und hier Probleme zu lösen, die für die einen klaren gesellschaftlichen Auftrag erfüllen. Ich glaube daran, dass ein Weg dazu ist, neue Technologien in Kombination mit spannenden Teams aufzubauen. Was ist das Reizvolle dabei? Das Spannende daran ist, sich mit einer Vielfalt an Themen auseinander zu setzen, Lösungen für die unterschiedlichsten Branchen zu suchen und hierbei immer Neues zu lernen. Was war vor “WhatAVenture“? Vor WhatAVenture habe ich mich intensiv mit der asiatischen Kultur auseinandergesetzt. Meine erste Gelegenheit dazu hatte ich während meines Studiums in Thailand. Ich habe an der Chulalongkorn Universität graduiert und war später für die Organisation und Durchführung von Studienprogrammen im asiatischen Raum zuständig. Zusätzlich war ich an der Durchführung der Machbarkeitsstudie für den Pakistan-Austria University Technology Park in Lahore, Pakistan, beteiligt. Ein weiterer wichtiger Ankerpunkt meines Lebens ist die Forschung. Ich habe mich während meines Doktorats intensiv mit der Motivationsforschung und der Anwendbarkeit von „open innovation“ Ansätzen in der Wirtschaft beschäftigt. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Den Auslöser für WhatAVenture gab mir eigentlich mein damaliger Kollege Thomas Funke. Er hatte damals die Idee geboren, einen Entrepreneurship Kurs an der Wirtschaftsuniversität in Wien aufzubauen. Hierbei eben nicht Theorie zu vermitteln, sondern Studierenden eine reale Chance zu geben, ihr Unternehmen zu starten. Der nächste logische Schritt war dann für mich selbst ins Tun zu kommen und eben Unternehmer zu werden. Auslöser für die Gründung war dann die Beobachtung, dass viele Teams systematisch die gleichen Fehler in der Entwicklung ihrer Projekte gemacht haben. Wir dachten uns, dass es dann auch eine systematische Methode geben kann, um Teams dabei zu unterstützen, diese Fehler zu vermeiden. Was sind Deine Ziele mit „WhatAVenture“? Mit WhatAventure verfolge ich das Ziel, ein Unternehmen aufzubauen, das erfolgreich ist. Erfolg bedeutet für mich, für die Zielgruppe einen signifikanten Mehrwert zu schaffen. Wir fokussieren uns hier v.a. auf etablierte Unternehmen. Ziel ist, diese Unternehmen nachhaltig zu begleiten, innovativer zu werden. Konkreter formuliert: Durch state-of-the-art Methoden in der Entwicklung von neuen Geschäftsideen Teams im Ökosystem von etablierten Unternehmen zu empowern, am Markt erfolgreich zu sein. Was braucht es an Unterstützung für Menschen, die ihr eigenes business schaffen wollen? Ein Unternehmen steht und fällt mit dem Team. Je besser das Team, desto höher die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit. Das bedeutet, man braucht Zugang zu einem Pool an Top Köpfen, die einerseits inhaltlich super sind, aber auch die richtige Motivation und Mentalität mitbringen. Was ist eigentlich das Spannendste an Deiner Arbeit mit Start Ups bzw. mit potentiellen Start Ups? Für mich ist das Spannendste daran, ihnen zu helfen ein Problem zu lösen. Hierbei geht es besonders darum, eine nachhaltige Lösung zu finden, die Mehrwert stiftet und dabei neue Technologien nutzt. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Entrepreneurship ist für mich das Thema Nummer 1—es geht hierbei immer um Haltung, eine Lebenseinstellung. Unternehmer sein bedeutet für mich, zu denen zu gehören, die etwas tun und offen zu sein für neue Herausforderungen und Erkenntnisse. Das beschränkt sich nicht nur auf meine Tätigkeit bei WhatAVenture, sondern ist eine Einstellung, die sich durch alle Themen zieht. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich bin neugierig. Meine Neugierde besteht darin, ob und wie man Bestehendes verändern kann und wie Systeme funktionieren. Es geht mir konkret darum, herauszufinden, was ich tun muss, um Altes zu optimieren oder auch zu zerstören und wieder neu aufbauen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Der Welt würden definitiv gute Problemlöser fehlen. Wir entwickeln neue Methoden und Ansätze, um bestehende Systeme zu optimieren und schaffen neue Zugänge, wie man alte Probleme löst. Wir arbeiten daran, wie man den Status Quo neu denken kann und darin sind wir gut. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Der Raum für meine Leidenschaft beginnt in dem Moment, in dem ich aufwache und reicht bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, wo ich schlafen gehe. Den Raum für meine Leidenschaft finde ich immer, wenn ich munter bin. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich verzichte sicher darauf gewisse Hobbys ausleben zu können, wie ich sie gerne ausleben würde. Ich führe keinen luxuriösen Lebensstil und kann auch meine Leidenschaft fürs Reisen nicht so ausleben, wie ich es gerne machen würde. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Es ist ein gutes Gefühl, wenn man eine Herausforderung gelöst hat, dadurch eine neue Ebene erreicht hat und das Unternehmen auf die nächste Stufe heben kann. Das kann entweder bedeuten neue Mitarbeiter einstellen zu können, eine neue Innovationsarchitektur geschaffen zu haben oder ganz einfach Probleme gelöst zu haben. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Zu meinen wichtigsten Unterstützern gehören sicher meine enge Familie, ausgewählte Freunde und Mitgesellschafter. Indirekt aber auch inspirierende Erfolgsgeschichten, an denen man sich orientieren kann und die einen motivieren. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Eine gute Workout Session, Kontextwechsel und dann wieder enge Familie, Freunde und meine Co-Gründer. Wohin wird Dich Deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Da gibt es einige spannende Ideen und Projekte in der Pipeline, die darauf warten verwirklicht zu werden. Es ist aber wichtig zu fokussieren. Mein Überziel ist es, gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Ich hoffe, dass mir das gelingt. Für mich ist es wichtig eine Vision zu entwickeln und Sinnhaftigkeit aufzuzeigen. Man muss den Leuten eine Rolle geben und einen Rahmen schaffen, in dem sie sich entfalten können. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Um ehrlich zu sein, ist das gar nicht mein erster Orientierungspunkt. Es geht mir zuerst darum, die Sinnhaftigkeit hinter Projekten und Initiativen für mich zu sehen. Der Input von anderen interessiert mich da nicht so sehr, ich bin im Endeffekt derjenige, der die Idee gut finden muss und hinter der Idee stehen muss. Ich differenziere auch stark zwischen dem Unternehmen WaV und mir als Person. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Das Wichtigste ist herauszufinden, wer man selber ist. Wer seine klare Identität gefunden hat, kann eine wahre Passion entwickeln und verfolgen, ohne sich dabei von gesellschaftlichen Normen abhalten zu lassen. Man sollte immer daran arbeiten seine Identität zu schärfen, um Passion zu entwickeln. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp,…? Das beste Buch, das ich jemals gelesen habe und ich wirklich empfehlen kann ist: Aging Well, G. Vaillant. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Elon Musk und sonst jeden, der eine coole Story zu erzählen hat.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/header-3-600x400.jpg","July 19, 2016","de",0.996076643466949,3.22398600474116e-05,0.963134855031967,0.000158579394337721,0.0366743507911451
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/20/a-personal-experience-on-shades-tours/","ImpactHub","A Personal Experience on SHADES TOURS","Ever since I started working at the Impact Hub in Vienna, I have been meeting people with incredible ideas and businesses. One such person is Perrine Schober of SHADES TOURS. For those of you that have not met Perrine, or heard of SHADES TOURS, here is a bit of background. SHADES TOURS offers activities and tours that discuss homelessness in Vienna. I attended the first tour given in English. The tour was a highly interactive experience led by one of Vienna’s homeless (or houseless). The English tour took us to three locations in the fourth and tenth districts of Vienna, the Hauptbahnhof, outside Caritas Peace Haven, and a local park. The tour started off at Wien Hauptbahnhof. A group of us from Impact Hub were on the tour that beautiful, sunny day. Initially, we met in front of the train station but it was warm and sunny, so we moved through the train station to the other side, where it was shady. While we walked through the train station, I saw a homeless man with all of his possessions attached to a bike, it was a sharp contrast to the beautiful sunny day outside and the camaraderie of the tour guests. As we stood in the shadow of the train station our guide asked us questions about how people became homeless and what homelessness meant. The tour group and our guide discussed why the train station is a gathering place for the city’s homeless population and the stories that unfold there daily. At the train station we were also introduced to the concept of the Street Management Teams. These teams comprise of dedicated social workers, who help those at risk access the social services available to them. Since the tour, I have seen these red jacketed social workers throughout the city. It seems that not only homelessness can appear invisible, if one does not know what to look for. Coming from Canada, the idea that there are social workers going out into the field to help people access social services is a most novel concept. For us, those at risk need to seek aid first, in order to receive assistance. The second location was the Caritas Peace Haven. For a Canadian, this is, again, a very novel concept. We have homeless shelters that sometimes provide accommodations at night, and most especially during our harsh winters, but the idea that there was a day centre where people could access food, internet, showers, and laundry was something new. For us, it is rare to find one place that offers all of these amenities under one roof. Our guide explained to us that there were different types of day centres for women and children in the city as well, so that those especially vulnerable, would be less wary of accessing these safe havens. The third location was a local park. Our guide showed us pictures of the parks during the refugee influx and what they looked like during the height of the crisis. We sat on benches in the shade and discussed the idea of a sense of security and peace that we have in our daily lives but that the homeless lack entirely. Our guide then switched gears slightly to share some stories about some of the individuals that he knew within the city. The stories were eye-opening and disheartening. From stories about theft and the acquisition of new addictions, to the role of mental illnesses and the length of time that homelessness persists for some individuals. Then our guide told us the uplifting success stories of those same individuals. Some are no longer homeless. By accessing the support of social workers and mental health professionals, they slowly built the skills necessary to return to a more normal life. I walked away from the tour with three things on my mind on that beautiful, sunny day. The first was a new understanding of the complexity of homelessness. Many of us look over the person who sleeping in the park or sitting asking for change on the steps. Rarely do we think about the depths of their anxiety over the safety of themselves and their belongings. I also came away with the knowledge that there are a large number of social institutions working together to create and maintain a social system for the homeless within Vienna. There is a large network of well funded charities and governmental social services that work in concert to address this issue. While this does not solve the deep seated problems of homelessness, it certainly makes a difference to the individual lives they touch. The third take away was the difference between homelessness and houselessness. Houselessness being that someone has an address but for various reasons, like domestic violence, he or she is unable to access his or her residence. This is not a concept that we have in Canada, and so, while it is mundane for Austrians to make this distinction based on a variety of factors affecting someone’s status it is not so for a Canadian. I caught up with Perrine after the tour and was able to ask her a few questions about Shades Tours and her guides. What is the most pressing issue with homelessness? “In my opinion, the most dangerous thing about homelessness is time. The longer a person is homeless, the more difficult is becomes for the person to change their status quo. It takes unbelievable strength, motivation, and determination to get out of being homeless when you battle a lack of belief, hope, motivation, strength, and self esteem coupled with unbearable shame and the constant struggle to organize the most basic of needs.” What is the one thing that can make a difference in the lives of the homeless? “Even with all of our social services assisting with the basic needs of the homeless there is one thing that makes a difference to a person who is homeless: employment. Employment is often the difference between homelessness and a fully integrated life. We all need tasks and work in order to feel useful, and to have a reason to wake up and shower everyday. This is not something that the social system can provide, or even is supposed to provide. I do not think that employment is a panacea to homelessness, but when they are ready and back on their feet, they should be able to find employment within the labour market.” What are you proud of with Shades Tours? “I am super proud of the Shades Tours guides. They may be fighting the toughest fight of their lives and I am glad that SHADES TOURS is one employment outlet that can provide them with the strength and motivation that they need.” *********** If you haven’t been on a SHADES TOUR yet, I encourage you to attend one. Austrians have created an amazing social system, and it is important to see it in action. For the rest of us, we need to take these ideas elsewhere in the world and replicate them.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/21/mastering-art-habits/","ImpactHub","Mastering the Art of Habits","The buzz words self-optimisation and maximum productivity have everybody on the road to constant improvement. Every entrepreneur knows that to achieve success, sole motivation is not enough – it’s the perseverance that keeps you going and working despite the difficulties of managing a company. However, keeping high levels of productivity up can become a solid part of your daily routine, if you manage to flip the magic switch and make certain activities into habits. “Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.” - Jim Ryun What are habits? According to Wikipedia, a habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. The thoughtless aspect is what makes habits so desirable. Think back to the times when you were trying to start cutting down on sugar or get up at 5 am every day to go to the gym. Initially every time you were faced with a decision, either to skip your regular spoonful of sugar in your coffee or wake up at this ungodly hour to fulfil your promise, your mind would spill a considerate amount of pros and cons giving you a choice. Sometimes its not beneficial to be given a choice, because our resolve can be weakened by naturally occurring internal questioning. Inner monologues waste cognitive involvement in something that should not have been so engaging; sometimes you even allow yourself to be talked out of your resolution. A habitual behaviour assures that you do things without paying too much attention to them, therefore the opportunity to back out does not present itself. The main reason we need habits when working, is to create a solid net of behaviours, which automatically keep us on track and in control. It is easy to slip when we let ourselves debate between working or not working. It’s completely painless to form a bad habit because with bad habits we tend to just play along. It’s the positive habits that bring benefits for us, that require more work. How to create a habit? When I started my hunt for the best methods to reinforce good work habits, I was googling ‘habits that generate success’ to emulate what the biggest achievers did to stick to their plans. Ultimately…I could not find an answer. I read about how Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs reached their success and created amazing companies, led countless numbers of projects to success end results and became legends of entrepreneurship. But how did they actually establish their exercise, analysis, team working, innovation, creative thinking habits? Then I came across the book ‘Better than Before’ by Gretchen Rubin. In her book, Gretchen debates different types of personalities that naturally predispose us to be susceptible to certain habit forming tactics. Did you notice that some people are able to seamlessly stick to a routine and work themselves into a habit? Maybe you consider yourself chronically unable establish a routine for a longer amount of time? If you fall into this category, Rubin’s 4 Habit Personalities will be especially insightful for you. Types of habit personalities We often forget that there is no magical cure-all because each of us is different. We have different aspirations, characters, and learning styles. This idea also applies to habits! There is no all-in-one solution that will reinforce your habit. No mantras, spells, or exercises, just plain knowing yourself and how your mind works before embarking on a life changing project. Gretchen Rubin came up with a habit tendency framework, which distinguishes four types of habit personalities. These personalities pinpoint conditions that have to be met for a habit to stick: Upholders respond readily to outer and inner expectations Questioners question all expectations; they’ll meet an expectation if they think it makes sense Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike Obligers meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet expectations they impose on themselves This simple framework points towards the right external and internal circumstances for a habit to settle in. For example, a friend of mine has no issue fulfilling her promises to someone else, but whenever she decides on a new workout routine, she drops it within a week. She is a classic Obliger. I suggested she hires a personal trainer, who will hold her accountable. I checked in with her three weeks later and she is continuing her training! After reading the book and finding out all about the four tendencies, I realized that my personality matches that of a Rebel. Initially I was worried about being against any type of binding commitments to myself and other people. Then I worked out that I can only truly commit when I am 100% convinced the habit I am trying to set in stone is worth working on. This encouraged me to be less harsh on myself when it comes to committing to long working hours. The result was letting myself be flexible with my schedule. Ironically, this caused my productivity to go up and I stopped complaining about never having time for myself. If you are struggling to implement a positive work habit, maybe it is because the strategy you took is not matching your habit personality? To find out your habit tendency, take the quiz here!

People are talking about this on business development forums, at conferences, on blogs, on news media sites, and at the dinner table. Impact Hub Vienna is not immune to this trend and we aim to bring you the best information possible to navigate this new business opportunity. A few weeks ago, Aneta posted an article on getting started with LinkedIn (which you can read here if you still don’t have a profile). This week we wanted to give those of you who have not looked at your profile in a little while, okay, a long while, reason to do so. In fact, we wanted to give you ten very good reasons. Tell the World: Dusting off your profile and your previous job information gives you a chance to reinvigorate your profile to reflect the exciting things you are now doing. You should tell the world all about it and LinkedIn is the perfect way to do so. Create new connections: An updated profile means that your network gets notified to the changes that you have made in your profile page (or your company’s profile page). This update notification means that you and your business are fresh in the minds of your network contacts. The next time your field of expertise comes up in conversation with a potential client or investor that is outside of your network, you are at the forefront of your contacts’ minds. New opportunities: Use LinkedIn’s search function to find member profiles, both individual and institutional, that have a history of social impact investing. An updated profile can help potential investors determine if they want to invest in you or your company when you find them. Share and share alike: Just like with HubNet, you can see what others within your field are doing. You can also exchange ideas with the millions of users in the broader business community on LinkedIn. Great minds think alike: Groups are a more detailed and intimate way to share information within your networks. HubNet has them and so does LinkedIn. Groups allow you to expand your network to include the members with the groups and this further expands your network reach. Manage your Brand: LinkedIn allows you to create your own individual profile page (and your organization page) as well as subsidiary pages. This means that you can create targeted pages and messaging for different groups and aspects of your network. Create Brand Traffic: The features within LinkedIn make it one of the easiest and least expensive ways to build and manage a brand for your company. You can post photos and videos, as well as link your websites, blogs, and twitter feeds all in one convenient location. This also assists in developing a brand following for your company or product through more social media sharing; which means more traffic, in general, for your site. Stop the Silent Treatment: In a post from two weeks ago we discussed the need to keep talking to your customers through social media sites, and LinkedIn is one of them. If you have a profile, but have not updated it in a long time, it is the same as if you stopped speaking to everyone in your professional network. Remember that these are potential clients and investors and you have to continue to build a relationship with them; updating your profile is a good way to do that. Come Find Me: According to Forbes Online and LinkedIn Pulse updating your profile can boost you and your company to the top of google search lists. Refreshing your profile and Search Engine Optimizing can get your company higher on the list of returned Google search items; that is good exposure for any social start up organization. We’re Here: That is right, Impact Hub Vienna is following our own advice and we are refreshing the content of our LinkedIn profile. Come find us on LinkedIn and follow us. Our new profile will be launching next week!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CoffeeCountDown-copy-600x400.jpg","July 25, 2016","en",0.991375803947449,0.000582819920964539,0.847525119781494,0.00335814594291151,0.148533821105957
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/26/teresa-hammerl-wer-braucht-einen-klassischen-lebenslauf/","ImpactHub","Teresa Hammerl: Wer braucht einen klassischen Lebenslauf?","Teresa Hammerl arbeitet als Journalistin und Silicon Valley Korrespondentin. Auf Twitter findet ihr Teresa unter @colazionearoma. Aufgewachsen in Wien lebt Sie derzeit in San Francisco. Besonders interessiert Teresa alles, was im Internet passiert, da vor allem Social Networks wie Facebook, Instagram oder Twitter. Teresa ist Co-Founderin von Fillmore.at, einem Online Magazin, das sich mit Themen aus dem Silicon Valley und dem deutschsprachigen Raum beschäftigt. Außerdem ist sie für die täglichen News aus dem Silicon Valley auf t3n.de und bei unterschiedlichen Projekten auch für Social Media Content verantwortlich oder als Bloggerin tätig. Teresa war auch bereits Co-Organisatorin bei unterschiedlichen Events, wie dem Startup Weekend Vienna oder dem Betapitch Vienna, ehrenamtlich ist sie in San Francisco für Projekte wie das Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival oder die Reading Partners tätig. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich dabei an? Ich weiß nicht, ob man das Leidenschaft nennen kann, aber ich mag es, andere Menschen dabei zu unterstützen, neue Dinge zu lernen oder etwas besser zu verstehen. Nachrichten aufzubereiten gehört dabei für mich genauso dazu, wie jemanden dabei zu helfen, Programmieren zu lernen oder einer Volksschülerin, etwa gemeinsam mit den Reading Partners hier in San Francisco, beim Erwerben von besseren Lesefähigkeiten zu helfen. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Journalismus entdeckt? Meine Großmutter hat mir immer von ihr selbst geschriebene Geschichten vorgelesen. Das hat mich sehr früh dazu gebracht, dass ich selbst angefangen habe zu schreiben. Irgendwann habe ich dann gemerkt, dass ich mich für Reportagen interessiere und habe begonnen selbst welche zu schreiben. Das war als Jugendliche, später habe ich Texte ins Internet gestellt. Warum gerade dieser Beruf? Heute finde ich den Beruf der Journalistin besonders deswegen spannend, weil man Missstände aufzeigen kann und mit etwas Glück die Möglichkeit hat, Dinge zum Besseren zu verändern. Klappt das nicht, dann hat man mit Worten die Chance auf etwas hinzuweisen. Außerdem finde ich es gerade jetzt sehr spannend, wie sich der Beruf in der Zukunft entwickeln wird. Facebook Live und Periscope, VR und 360 Grad Videos werden bald Teil des Alltags sein, wobei es interessant sein wird, wie sich all das integriert. Was ist das Reizvolle am Medium Blog für dich? Dass alle einen Blog anlegen können. Das klappt auch ohne Vorkenntnisse zu haben. Wenn man keine besonderen Designvorstellungen hat oder an anderen Feinheiten interessiert ist, sondern nur einen Text online stellen will, geht das sofort. Theoretisch. Praktisch gibt es da aber trotzdem viele Hindernisse, sei es gesperrte Plattformen in manchen Ländern, Hasskommentare oder individuelle Probleme, für die niemand zuständig ist. Darüber sollte man mehr sprechen. In einem Artikel schreibst du, dass du nie zur Schule gegangen bist. Wie hat sich diese Tatsache aus deiner Sicht auf deine berufliche Laufbahn ausgewirkt? Sehr stark. Ich habe mir immer einen nicht ganz so leichten, individuellen Weg ausgesucht, den zuvor noch nicht so viele gegangen sind. Ich lege keinen Wert auf einen klassischen Lebenslauf oder den linearen Karriereverlauf. Wichtig ist mir vielmehr, dass ich niemals aufhöre dazuzulernen und mir Wissen selbst aneigne. Mit vorgegebenen Strukturen kann ich nur schwer umgehen. Was muss sich aus deiner Sicht am Bildungswesen ändern, um Kinder und Jugendliche besser auf Leben & Beruf vorzubereiten? Ich glaube, dass es wichtig ist, das Bildungssystem im Gesamten zu überarbeiten, statt immer nur kleine Veränderungen vorzunehmen. Mehr Praxis ist ein ganz wichtiges Thema, bei Prüfungen habe ich oft nicht verstanden, warum ich etwas erlernen muss, das ich mir im Detail kaum merken werde, obwohl ich viel lieber andere, für mich interessante Themen vertieft hätte. Das Lernen zu lernen ist des Weiteren meiner Meinung nach einer der wichtigsten Aspekte. Dazu gehört es ebenso zu wissen, wie man etwas auf seine Richtigkeit überprüft. Eine Fähigkeit, die man als Journalistin benötigt und die man schon in der Schule lernen sollte. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Na klar! Ich glaube, das gehört zu meinem Beruf dazu. Ich glaube, ich bin besonders gut beim stillen Recherchieren, wie ich es nenne. Dazu gehört es, dass ich Google Tools (zum Beispiel die umgekehrte Bildersuche), Web Archive benutze, Informationen von öffentlichen Stellen erfrage oder einfach nur Firmendaten anschaue. Manchmal liegen Auffälligkeiten direkt vor einem, trotzdem muss man sie erst einmal erkennen. Wer sind deine derzeitigen Energietreiber? Das ist gar nicht so einfach zu sagen, da ich im Moment etwas an Motivation verloren habe. Als freie Journalistin ist man oft in so einem Schwebezustand, in dem man sich eine Redaktion, mit der man über Ideen sprechen kann, herbei wünscht. Ich weiß aber mittlerweile, dass ich selbst meine größte Energietreiberin bin. Wenn ich nicht selbst von dem überzeugt bin, was ich gerade mache, dann weiß ich, dass es Zeit ist, sich nach einem neuen Weg umzusehen. Du beschreibst dich immer wieder als „Internetmensch“. Ist es dein Beruf oder deine Berufung? Ich glaube, dass es weder noch ist. Vermutlich ist es aber hilfreich, als Journalistin heute auch mit dem Internet umgehen zu können. Weil es mir auch noch großen Spaß macht und ich ständig neue spannende Aspekte entdecken kann, bezeichne ich mich gerne als Internetmensch. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich arbeite stets gerne von zuhause aus, weil ich mich da gut konzentrieren kann und nicht von meinem Umfeld abgelenkt werde. Auf der anderen Seite fehlt mir dann immer wieder Inspiration, weshalb ich auch gerne in unterschiedlichen Coworking Spaces bin. In San Francisco ist das etwa das Workshop Cafe. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Vielleicht auf Sicherheiten, einen geregelten Arbeitsalltag und ein fixes Einkommen. Ich habe allerdings nicht das Gefühl, dass ich wirklich auf etwas verzichten muss, für mich ist das, was ich dafür bekomme, eine Bereicherung. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Wissen, dass man dank dem Internet und einem gut aufgebauten Netzwerk schnell und mit etwas Mühe eine Vielzahl an Menschen erreichen kann. Texte und Bilder zu gestalten, die etwas erreichen können, ist sicherlich einer der besten Momente in meinem Beruf. Außerdem ist es toll, viele neue interessante und kreative Menschen kennenzulernen. Mir ist es dabei besonders wichtig, vielleicht abseits von so manchem Trend, nicht stets mit den gleichen Personen oder Führungskräften zu sprechen. Was ist das Schwierigste am Freelancertum? Für mich war am Anfang die größte Herausforderung Kunden zu finden, mit denen man für mehr als nur einen Artikel zusammenarbeiten kann. Dieses Problem tritt auch jedes Mal wieder auf, wenn ich mich noch einmal neu orientiere. Mit der Zeit bekommt man aber mehr Erfahrung und hat sich auch mehr einen Namen in der Szene, bei mir ist das der deutschsprachige Raum, gemacht. Wichtig ist dabei, sich nicht unter seinem Wert zu verkaufen, sondern zu wissen, was man kann und das auch zu sagen. Was nicht ausgesprochen ist, kann das Gegenüber nicht wissen. Marketing für sich selbst zu machen, ist immer wieder ein nicht ganz so einfacher Punkt des Freelancerdaseins. Aber auch hier hilft das Internet sehr. Wohin wird Dich deine Reise noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Gemeinsam mit Elisabeth Oberndorfer führe ich ja unser Online Magazin Fillmore und wir nehmen uns im Moment die Zeit, um herauszufinden, wo unsere Ziele sind. Außerdem überlege ich im Moment, wie lange ich in San Francisco bleiben möchte und wie meine Zukunft hier aussehen wird. Also ja, geheime Projekte gibt es auf jeden Fall, ich muss auch selbst noch herausfinden, welche das genau sind. Wie gelingt es Dir, Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Wenn ich in der Vergangenheit dachte, dass es mir gelungen ist, dass ich jemanden zu Social Media Kommunikation gebracht habe, dann war das deshalb, weil ich persönliche Geschichten erzählt habe. Meiner Erfahrung nach funktioniert es also am besten, wenn ich positive, aber auch negative persönliche Beobachtungen teile, die etwas Abstraktes greifbarer machen. Außerdem finde ich es stets wichtig, dass das Gegenüber Fragen stellen kann und man, soweit es möglich ist, diese beantwortet. Man soll gegenseitig voneinander lernen können. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Mein Umfeld ist immer interessiert an dem, was ich mache und findet es auch spannend, denke ich. Außerdem arbeiten viele meiner Freundinnen und Freunde in einem ähnlichen Gebiet, für die ist das, was ich mache, auch ganz normal. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Tipp? Wer nach San Francisco kommt, sollte in den Botanischen Garten im Golden Gate Park gehen. Anschließend bietet sich ein Kaffee im Stable Cafe an. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Ninia LaGrande, Rotraut Schöberl und Carina Wetzlhütter.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/header-2-600x400.jpg","July 26, 2016","de",0.990557312965393,0.151362305057167,0.810149391492208,0.0122754081445843,0.0262128897399331

The summer months are always quiet at Impact Hub Vienna. Many Hubbers go on holiday, work outside or just relax and enjoy the weather. Some of you may think that these breaks from work are ‘bad’ and that they give you guilty feelings that you are ‘not working hard enough,’ but many scientific studies have shown the importance of having breaks and taking trips. But what are some of the BENEFITS of taking a break? Breaks make you happy! Breaks help you re-evaluate your goals Breaks help you make new connections in your brain Breaks help you generate new ideas Breaks give you a fresh outlook on your problems And once more because its important – breaks make you happy! It is hard to quantify the value of longer breaks and holidays from work, yet we can see it is a regular practice within many companies. Every 7 years designer, Stefan Sagmeister takes 1 year off to reassess his work and his priorities, he even did a TED Talk on the idea! Other companies often take company retreats for example, in 2015 Buffer spent $111,874 on their company retreat to improve interpersonal connections. Not too shabby. Like these companies, we at Impact Hub Vienna understand this and actively encourage our team and members to take regular breaks, both privately and as a team. What’s more is that our members agree with us, and some even offer opportunities to take breaks with them! Naleia Yachting, run by Dominik Sarapata, is a week of sailing for people who want to recharge their batteries, meet easy going, open-hearted people and experience friendship and bonding with total strangers. It is a week of exploring wild and secluded bays, eating in cosy, local restaurants and retreating to an adventurous life driven by the forces of the nature. Valentin Heppner from Alpine Verein, organises a wide range of tours and activities in nature. He recently organised a rafting event for the Impact Hub Vienna community, if you take a tour with him you are sure to have a fun adventure! Authentictys is an online platform based at Impact Hub Madrid that connects visitors with local and unforgettable experiences. They are recent participants of the Impact Hub Scaling Program and they design and host experiences with our community of entrepreneurs to curate an incredible time that is sure to leave a positive impact in the city. So make sure you take some time out this summer for a break in the sun!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PlaneBanner-copy-600x400.jpg","August 2, 2016","en",0.995725214481354,0.117770910263062,0.221673414111137,0.00480988016352057,0.655745804309845

When we thought about the space we have available here, we decided to take some inspiration from the art world and try a different tact. You may have noticed that we have been searching for artists, designers and creatives and offering them space to display their work. Our space is perfect for showing off Vienna based artists and we are excited to welcome them into our community. The deal is that we give these artists a space to exhibit their work for free and they get 100% of the profit if a piece is sold. Pretty solid deal if you ask us. We put out the call a while back and it generated a lot of interest. Photographers, illustrators, designers, artists and print makers all submitted their portfolios and we were astounded at the talent that exists in Vienna. We narrowed it down and are proud to introduce you to the 4 artists selected. Works from these artists will be displayed throughout Impact Hub Vienna later this year. Michaela Putz is a multi-media artist. Her work deals with social systems and the institutional context where they are used. For example, she analyses rituals within child-welfare or patient-doctor interactions and sees how those rituals change human relationships. While studying printmaking in Vienna, she created graphic works and large-scale installations, which serve as mappings of these influences on the subject. You can check out her work here. Guilio Paolini is a photographer. Giulio Paolini is an applied and artistic photographer. His work seeks to interact with people and their artifacts on a stronger more visceral level, in order to bring out the social dynamics that lay behind them and make them visible. For instance, in his ‘Next Generation’ series he seeks to engage people in a conversation about their digital personas and their instincts. You can see his work here. Barbara Moura is an illustrator. Barbara Moura is a full time dreamer and illustrator based in Vienna. The main subjects of her illustrations are usually feminism, sexuality, world problems or emotional struggles, often personalised by self-portraits. View her portfolio online here. Pauline Louise Noemi Jocher is a graphic designer. She is interested in extraordinary surfaces and details. Organic inspired structures comprise the fundamentals for her drawings and prints. Pauline’s goal is not to depict the subjects as they are, rather as she imagines them in perfection. Check out her work here. The exhibition of the works from these artists at Impact Hub Vienna will be kicked off with a vernissage during our Wine Down on October 20 under the topic “Breaking Patterns”.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/09/linkedin-step-step-ooo-baby/","ImpactHub","LinkedIn: Step by step, ooo baby!","LinkedIn: it’s not just for your next job search any more. The social network we all know about is up to do good! The platform is now actively investing in promoting social change among its more than 300 million users. LinkedIn For Good, is a service used to connect people in need, to people with skills and willingness to help them. It’s all part of their desire to increase volunteerism and create social change, with human capital. And we are totally on board. If the 10 reasons we gave you to dust off your profile wasn’t enough, this is another great reason to do so! So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get down to business. Here is an easy—and fun—step-by-step* guide to get you on board with us: Step 1 — We can have lots of fun Let’s impact the world together. “Social impact organizations—social entrepreneurs included—are notoriously strapped for resources, but they are also some of the most innovative individuals in the world,” acknowledges Bob Spoer from LinkedIn. How do you get talent to help you on your mission to change the world? LinkedIn teamed up with VolunteerMatch to fill in this gap using its social network platform. One way is by allowing its members to showcase the causes they are passionate about on their profile, and whether or not they are interested in volunteer work. Another feature is to enable members to browse through non-profit and volunteer job listings the same way they would do with any other kind of job. “Imagine the collective impact of each of our 300 million members finding and acting on one volunteer opportunity on LinkedIn—it could create transformational social impact,” says Spoer. Action: Find people that are as passionate about your cause as you are, and have a set of skills that you need to move forward with your start-up. Or contribute to a cause you love. Join groups on LinkedIn! Step 2 — There’s so much we can do True story. Who has the time to create and maintain yet another social media platform? But we are here to help. The best thing you can do is to divide and conquer. Don’t try to do all at once. Make a plan, for example, Day1: work on your profile; Day 2: Join Groups; Day 3: Follow organizations and potential investors. Laura Shin, who is a career adviser and finance writer genius, devised 5 smart ways to use LinkedIn and get the most out of it. In addition to making your profile findable and visually appealing, make sure you connect strategically and stay active on the site. Laura advises us to “remind your contacts that you’re doing good work by regularly sharing links relevant to others in your industry, keeping your profile current, and updating your profile when you are hired for a new position or have another accomplishment to tout.” Action: To get you started, we will help you follow her first tip: To make your profile visually appealing and findable. If you don’t have a nice picture to use on your LinkedIn profile, come talk to us. We can help you out with it. We can also use this photo to get you up on our new Success Board at the Impact Hub. As for your headline, which runs right under your name, don’t only state your current job position as most people do. It is better to be more creative. Describe what you do, or write about your skill set, using keywords you would search for in your field, and keep it short, like a tweet. Step 3 — It’s just you and me We are following our own advice. Impact Hub Vienna is working on its LinkedIn presence to get the most of it. If the platform is up to do good and is offering opportunities to create even more impact, we are in! We have already revamped our profile page and changed the text that introduces what we do. We are also working on a better picture that represents who we are, and we are now making connections with the most important people – this means you. Our members first! And that’s why we want you with us. We are more than 400 like-minded people at the Impact Hub Vienna alone. Once you complete your profile, don’t forget to find us there too. Action: This one is easy: Connect with Impact Hub Vienna, here is the link for you. Step 4 — I can give you more We are the most connected hub in the world. That’s right! We strive to get connected with other hubs all over the world. We believe in collaboration and movement-building. One of our goals in getting more active on LinkedIn is to get you exposed to the right people. Besides connecting to Impact Hub members around the globe, we want to connect with the start-up scene here and abroad, to link to our current partners, meet potential investors and forge new relationships. Action: If you have any suggestions of who you want us to be connected with or any company that would benefit our community, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Step 5 — Don’t you know that the time is right? If you are still skeptical about it consider this: every second two new members join LinkedIn. The platform is growing at a fast rate, and will keep this trend going now that Microsoft has bought it for no less than 26 Billion dollars…in cash! LinkedIn is definitely worth paying attention to. It’s super useful for anyone who’s either searching for a job, trying to network with like-minded individuals, or starting a company. LinkedIn offers many resources for entrepreneurs, such as groups, including the very popular “On Startups” group that has over 54,000 members. Branded properly, entrepreneurs can attract the right kind of business opportunities and talents. You can also search for service providers or partners there. Plus, for any kind of career opportunity, Laura Shin says, “whether it be a new job, speaking engagement or collaboration, a professional online presence is needed for. And a LinkedIn profile, done right, can be that much-needed online resume, that helps ensure the good work you do is publicly recognized and that others know how to reach you with relevant opportunities.” Action: Create a group and be part of a community. Make sure you share consistently to your LinkedIn company page and profile by for example scheduling your posts. While doing this step-by-step, have some fun and dance a little to the original tunes with the most famous boys-band from the 90s: New Kids on the Block*.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/10/strike-a-pose-with-our-new-resident-hub-yogis/","ImpactHub","Strike a yoga pose with our new resident Hub yogis","Now take a deep breath in, hold it for three counts and then exhale, because you’re about to read an article about yoga at the Hub. As you might have guessed it, Impact Hub Vienna is now offering weekly yoga classes. Every Tuesday morning, you can relax and reinvigorate at the Hub, setting you up for a productive and stress reduced work week. Classes are held by two wonderful yogis Elena Popov and Annemarie Punschart. I recently attended one of Annemarie’s morning classes and got to catch up with her about her yoga journey and how she ended up at Impact Hub Vienna. Originally from Austria, Annemarie recently moved back after spending the past 21 years in New York City and Colorado. She is a dual citizen and considers herself to be an “Austro American,” a real mash up of both cultures, as she has spent such a significant amount of time in both countries. She learned about Impact Hub Vienna a while back and was impressed by its “positive, upbeat, inspiring and collaborative” vibe, where members were working together, “in support of a more sustainable world.” She was hooked and couldn’t wait to get involved. What sparked your interest in yoga? I started doing YOGA in the Jivamukti tradition in the early 90s when I was living in NYC. At some point all the “Sex and the City” women were all doing yoga, so then I simply had to follow the trend as a true New Yorker. Practicing yoga and becoming an instructor are very different. Why did you decide to teach? After a devastating skydiving accident in 2003, I experienced a broken spine, spinal surgery, serious nerve damage to inner organs and a broken leg bones. This experience dramatically and mindfully turned my connection to body, spirit and community. Yoga helped me get my broken body and mind back in line, all of the sudden it also was not just about the movements and postures any longer, I started to also listen and follow the entire yoga lifestyle teachings that connect body, mind, emotions and intellect. Its so powerful and beautiful to become more aware, more aligned and in tune. What brought you to Vienna? If you’re not from here <U+0001F609> LOVE originally brought me back to Vienna (hmmmm, that one did now work out so well…) and I guess my curiosity about how it would be move back to Austria again after all these years. I liked the idea of digging around my roots a bit more in detail. Also family brought me back of course and my vagabond heart that constantly asks for that genuine life experience. What projects are you working on? www.VENUSfrequency.com is my yoga lifestyle platform. I am combining my yoga and meditation classes with a radio show with the same name on RADIOorangewww.o94.at. Every 2nd and 4th Friday @ 7am ‘the yogic edition’ and every FIRST Sunday @ 11pm, ‘the pop|culture edition.’ I am building my brand on that platform, which includes my teachings and offerings, and am currently thinking of turning it into a VEREIN in order to receive financial support for my passion and quest to support mindfulness and help heal the world. Big dreams, I know. With my www.conferencedirect.com affiliation I help organizations, associations, event and seminar organizers to find the right hotel and meeting room locations for their events, assist in negotiating the contracts and add my 20+ years in the convention and meeting planning world to their wealth of expertise, all @ NO COST. If you know of anyone having a hard time with finding and deciding on the right hotel or struggling with hotel contracts for any of their events, have them contact me. This is my big girl job, but I would like to reverse the ranking here soon. What are you passionate about (besides yoga)? – the entire yoga lifestyle – hosting my radio show – traveling – people – conversations – wine, whiskey, food – everything outdoors – finding a way to get VENUSfrequency really off the ground (if you have any tips please let me know; I’m all ears!) -updating my Facebook and Instagram channels Where else can people find you when you’re not at Impact Hub? – riding a heavy city bike around town or my fast roadbike to Tulln and back – lying in the sun along the Danube somewhere – riding trains all over Austria (I’m trying to do the no car thing) – having a good glass of wine and a bite to eat with friends – snowboarding in the winter – looking for a choir to join somewhere to sing songs besides my “om-mmming and chanting mantras” Why should Impact Hub members do more yoga? It goes with everything that Impact Hubbers stand for! We are the ones that positively impact the world, and so does yoga. Its not just about the movement, there is so much more to it. I encourage everyone to come see, listen and be part of at least one class to get you started. I teach what I call a ‘pop|culture’ way of the yoga lifestyle. Is there is good music? Yes. Are there chanting and meditation and breathing exercises? Sometimes… but everything is brought to you in a very modern and understandable way. Trust me. Practicing yoga is so powerful and in the long run, it will make the world a better place. In one hour you get empowerment, tons of energy, some ancient wisdom, strength and the constant reminder to come back to YOUR present moment, your center… all with a cool community of Hubbers right there with you! YOGA, meditation, and mindfulness are not just trending because of the cool pants and music, they really do elevate all of our existence to be better. Its becoming part of our culture and it for sure doesn’t hurt! Thanks for the insights Annemarie and I’ll definitely be seeing you on Tuesdays at 8am!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/header-600x400.jpg","August 10, 2016","en",0.997538149356842,0.000175199340446852,0.0746575333178043,0.000274016289040446,0.924893230199814
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/16/impact-of-dressing-for-success/","ImpactHub","Impact of Dressing for Success","We all show up to work looking our fashionable best. And I might add, we all look pretty good doing it. However working in the same place, within similar same industries. This can sometimes make it challenging when we are selling a product to people outside of the Impact Hub Vienna bubble. We all know it and there is research to back it up – a first impression is made within seconds. Before either of you have a chance to exchange hello’s, someone has made a critical evaluation of you and placed you in a category – colleague, student, investment opportunity, etc. So how do you make the best first impression possible within those first few seconds? The answer is simple: your appearance. As I am not from Austria and do not know the norms with respect to dress codes, it is safe to say that my experience in this field is limited. So I sat down one afternoon for a coffee with Hanna Schatovitch, founder of Hanna in the House in 2016. Hanna offers style and career coaching. She believes that when it comes to dressing for success, your style is your business card. All I wanted to talk about last Thursday was style and Hanna helped me out. Investor, legal, and financial meetings can be pretty overwhelming. So we wanted to help you out with a bit of advice for when you are standing in front of your wardrobe and have no idea what to wear to that investor meeting. Spoiler alert: you don’t necessarily have to wear the suit that is in the back of your wardrobe in order to wow your audience. As Hanna likes to say there is a great style for every personality, every budget and type of individual. There is also a formal style for every personality, within every industry. Tip #1: Always be yourself Now this one may seem obvious, but the trick here is to be yourself, but a bit more dressed up. This could be as simple as changing a pair of shoes or throwing a blazer on top of your outfit. Feeling comfortable in your own skin is important, but so is feeling comfortable with a little bit of formality. Tip #2: Be Comfortable Hanna says that this means knowing what looks good on you and what feels good to you. This means knowing and understanding your proportions, body type, and the colours that look good on you. For Hanna this is of utmost importance because if you do not feel good in what you are wearing then you will not be confident and your audience with notice. You might not be comfortable in a formal black suit, so wear dress slacks (or a skirt) and a blazer in colours in which you feel comfortable and confident. Tip #3: Know your audience There are certain wardrobe expectations within every business environment, and the more traditional the sector, the more formal and traditional their unwritten dress code. This might mean that everyone shows up for work everyday in a suit and tie (the ladies are probably exempt from the tie requirement). If you have a meeting with a person from a traditional business sector, like banking, insurance, law, or finance, the way in which they and their colleagues dress will influence their expectations for your appearance. This means that you might have to dress a little more formally than you do everyday. The main takeaway is to feel confident in your clothes. Confidence is sexy and the likely hood of you scoring that job/investor/project pitch will go up significantly if your confidence shines.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/18/hub-yoga-round-two/","ImpactHub","Hub Yoga Round Two","Find a calm place and clear your mind of any distracting or unnecessary thoughts because we are about to focus on yoga at the Hub…again. Last week we introduced one of our resident yogis, Annemarie and this week we are catching up with Elena. You can catch both of them at our weekly Tuesday yoga classes at 8am. Born in Russia and raised in Germany, Elena moved to Vienna in 2012 to pursue her degree in East Asian Economy and Society. She actually started her journey with Impact Hub at the Tokyo co-working space, where she did an internship before moving to Vienna to study. What sparked your interest in yoga? I wanted to connect with my body – to feel it and sense all the little things, which go on inside of me. Practicing yoga and becoming an instructor are very different. Why did you decide to teach? First of all I love to work with people on different levels and yoga is about mental and physical health. As a yoga teacher you work on both levels. Secondly, I enjoy teaching. It is simply an another approach to connect with people. Finally, I believe that we always have a little teacher and student within ourselves. I learn from my students and they learn from me in return. What projects are you working on? I am currently writing my master’s thesis and I teach yoga. Life can be also as simple as that! Who would have thought? What are you passionate about (besides yoga)? I love traveling and cannot wait to pack my bags after graduation and visit parts of the world I have never been to. Music and dance are my other passions in life. But you can’t enjoy life without great friends and loving people around you, and I am quite lucky to have wonderful people in my life. Where else can people find you when you’re not at Impact Hub? You can find me at Doktor Yoga in the 1st district. I also teach private classes at clients’ homes. What are some of your favorite songs/playlists/artists to listen to when you practice yoga? This is a really tough question. There are so many different artists on my playlists and there are so many different playlists! One of my current playlists includes Eefje de Visser, RY X, Bahamas, and Ólafur Arnalds. Why should Impact Hub members do more yoga? Everybody should listen to themselves and their body. If you do feel like yoga can benefit you, then you should do it. If you think it is not for you, then I’d say give it a try at least once. Many people say they are not flexible enough, but that is like staying that you are too dirty to take a bath. Each time I have left a yoga class, I always felt better than before the class. Thanks for the introduction Elena and I’ll be seeing you on Tuesdays at 8am at the Hub!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/header-2-600x400.jpg","August 18, 2016","en",0.997323751449585,0.000146783553645946,0.616962909698486,0.000384756916901097,0.382505565881729

Westbahnhof became a temporary campground, as we attempted to make the newcomers feel welcome and safe. However, the process of integration is not as straightforward as processing paperwork. It takes time, patience and a fair amount of courage. The courage to start over, learn a new language, and accept a new way of life in a different place. We often find ourselves asking where we fit into this complex mosaic of political tensions and disrupted dreams. Where can our skills be put to use and what projects can we join to help create a positive impact? Partnering with various organizations, Impact Hub Vienna is committed to addressing this issue. Matthias Reisigner, co-founder of Impact Hub Vienna believes that, “creating new prospects for the future is essential for the successful integration of refugees. Thus, enabling integration into the Austrian labor market is of special importance. Only by having jobs, people are able to secure a livelihood for themselves and become integrated and productive parts of society.” Our newest program, found! is one such example. A collaboration between Deloitte Future Fund and Impact Hub Vienna, found! supports innovative and sustainable initiatives that create employment opportunities for refugees. Supported by an intensive, six month long incubation process, our aim with found! is to successfully establish the supported ideas, helping make them sustainable and scalable projects. And it is not too late to join! Applications from individuals, teams or existing initiatives/start-ups are welcome until September 4th at 6:00pm. The six best ideas will be selected from the pool of applicants to start the six month incubation program. The initiatives receive support to grow their idea from a concept all the way to a final pitch. Successful applicants will receive business coaching, individual consulting, access to the Impact Hub Vienna co-working space, mentoring, access to workshops, and access to the Deloitte and Impact Hub international networks. Deadline for Applications: September 4, 2016 – 6:00 PM Ideegration is another such incubator, addressing the integration process for refugees. Coming together on November 10th, Ideegration is currently searching for 15 top initiatives to participate in their incubation program. The participants will receive support from experts in management , consulting, business, politics, PR and marketing. Furthermore, five of the 15 will receive start up funding and work together even more closely with a team of experts to see their projects to completion. They are also calling on individuals to help support the good work that is already being done to address this issue. Whether you are a graphic designer or a consultant, they are looking for your help to help promote existing initiatives. Deadline for Applications: October 9th, 2016 If you are feeling inspired and want to join in, check out found! or Ideegration and stay tuned for the selected initiatives!

Micha hat Philosophie und Rechtswissenschaften in Graz mit Auslandsaufenthalten in Israel und Mexiko studiert. Er sieht sich als Optimist, reist gerne und ist einer dieser Gutmenschen. Mit seinem Bruder will er die biologische Landwirtschaft fördern; deshalb nahgenuss. Ziel ist es zu zeigen, dass auch kleinstrukturierte Landwirtschaft eine Zukunft hat, besonders wenn es um die Produktion von Fleisch geht. Fleisch soll als das wahrgenommen werden was es ist: Ein besonderes Genussprodukt. Was treibt Dich an? Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass die Welt in der wir heute leben, die beste Welt ist, die es je gab. Und dies, trotz der Kriege, der großen Armut vieler Gegenden und der großen Zerstörung der Umwelt; Dinge die es leider alle nach wie vor gibt. Was mich an der Welt an sich fasziniert, ist zu sehen, wie wir Menschen unser Zusammenleben ordnen; wie wir uns all diesen Problemen stellen. Es gibt nur noch wenige Wüsten, Urwälder oder Gebirgszüge die nicht von uns Menschen besiedelt sind. Mit so vielen Bewohnern bedarf es einer immer besseren Ordnung unseres Zusammenlebens. Gleichzeitig bringen neue Technologien neue Herausforderungen, die nicht nur neue Gesetzte fordern, sondern auch unser Zusammenleben ändern und andere soziale Normen hervorbringen. Die Auseinandersetzung von verschiedensten Weltanschauungen über unsere Zukunft: Wohin soll sich unsere Gesellschaft entwickeln? Was sind unsere Stärken? Was müssen wir noch besser machen? Fragen die sich jeder stellen kann. Ich weiß natürlich, dass dies jetzt die großen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft sind, die aber in dieser Größe auch unser tägliches Leben im Kleinen berühren. Was unsere Zeit einzigartig und deshalb auch so interessant macht, sind die Möglichkeiten eines einzelnen Menschen darauf Einfluss zu nehmen. Jeder kann sich darüber Gedanken machen was er sich von der Zukunft erwartet und seine Ideen auch sehr leicht verbreiten. Die Möglichkeit unsere Welt, wenn auch nur im Kleinen, ein Stück weit zu verbessern, treibt mich an. Welche Bedeutung hat gesunde Ernährung für Dich? Zwei Aspekte sind für mich hier ausschlaggebend: Wer sich gesund ernährt bleibt länger gesund. Wichtig ist mir, dass eine gesunde Ernährung nicht eine Frage des Einkommens sein darf. Jedes Kind, jeder Erwachsene sollte die Möglichkeit haben sich so zu ernähren, um möglichst lange gesund zu bleiben. Was mit Sorgfalt produziert wird, ist nicht nur gesund und schmeckt gut, sondern trägt auch dazu bei unseren Planeten und unsere Lebensgrundlage für die nächste Generationen zu schützen und zu bewahren. Wann hast Du die biologische Landwirtschaft für Dich entdeckt? Das Thema hat mich natürlich schon länger beschäftigt, und ich kenne schon seit meiner Kindheit einige Bio-Bauern sehr gut. So richtig beschäftigt mich das Thema aber erst seit einem Jahr (unserem Projektstart). Interessant ist es, mit den Bio-Landwirten zu reden und zu erfahren, welchen steinigen Weg viele gehen mussten. Viele wurden vor 20 Jahren noch belächelt; heute ist Bio-Landwirtschaft ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der österreichischen Produktion von Lebensmitteln. Worin siehst Du die Vorteile in der Direktvermarktung von biologischem Schweinefleisch? Desto kürzer der Weg vom Produzenten zum Konsumenten, desto besser für beide Seiten: Höhere Einkünfte bei den Landwirten und eine günstigere Möglichkeit für Konsumentinnen hochwertiges Bio-Fleisch zu kaufen. Die andere Seite ist die, dass KonsumentInnen wieder einen ehrlicheren Bezug zur Landwirtschaft und dem Produkt Fleisch bekommen. Mit eigenen Augen zu sehen, woher das Produkt kommt, zu sehen wer dahinter steht, verändert etwas beim Genuss von Fleisch. Man geht mit dem Produkt bewusster und sorgfältiger um. Bei Eurem Konzept spielt der Konsument eine wichtige Rolle. Warum ist es Dir so wichtig Konsumenten zum Teil von „nahgenuss“ zu machen? Fleisch war nicht immer ein „tägliches“ Essen. Es war etwas Besonderes, das es vielleicht sonntags oder an Feiertagen gab. Wir wollen dass unsere KonsumentInnen Fleisch als das wieder wahrnehmen was es ist: Ein besonderes Genussprodukt. Das soll uns durch den direkten Bezug zu den Bio-Bauern und Bio-Bäuerinnen gelingen. Gleichzeitig ist es unser Ziel, dass wieder alle Teile eines Schweines verwertet werden. Wenn ein Tier sterben muss, dann soll auch alles verwertet werden. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für die „nahgenuss“ gegeben? Gespräche mit meinem Bruder und in meiner Familie über ein derartiges Projekt hat es schon länger gegeben. Das waren dann aber eher Ideenspielereien. Das Projekt nahgenuss dann wirklich zu starten ist eher dem Zufall geschuldet. Wo siehst Du dich mit „nahgenuss“ in einem Jahr? Als einen kleinen aber feinen Bestandteil der österreichischen Landwirtschaft. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Wir haben ein Produkt am Markt, dass es so in dieser Form noch nicht gibt. Am schwierigsten ist es, sowohl genügend Landwirte als auch KonsumentInnen davon zu überzeugen, dass unser Weg Schweinefleisch zu verkaufen bzw. zu kaufen der Bessere ist. Dass es die Handelskonzerne in ihrer heutigen Form so gibt, hat schon einen guten Grund. Es ist ein unglaublicher Komfort zum Supermarkt um die Ecke zu gehen und Produkte aus aller Welt kaufen zu können. Dahinter steht ein riesiger Logistikapparat, den wir so in dieser Form nie werden bieten können. Uns wird es nur gelingen erfolgreich zu sein, wenn wir es schaffen, KonsumentInnen zu überzeugen, dass bei Fleisch unser Weg der Bessere für Mensch, Tier und Umwelt ist; gleichzeitig müssen wir neue Strukturen (z.B. den Postversand von Fleisch) gut nützen. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich frage und lese viel. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? Als studierter Philosoph könnte ich hier sicherlich mehr sagen, aber ich kürze das Ganze ab: Keine Termine und ein Glas Bier. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Obwohl mein Bruder und ich nicht unterschiedlicher sein könnten, was uns verbindet ist unser Drang zumindest eine Kleinigkeit für eine bessere Welt beizutragen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf einen klassischen Karriereweg.. Ich habe Jus und Philosophie studiert und könnte jetzt auch einen recht gut bezahlten Job haben. Diesen Weg habe ich zumindest noch nicht eingeschlagen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Abwechslung und die Menschen die man trifft. Auch wenn unsere Firma winzig ist, bin ich der Chef der Firma und als Chef trifft man bei Terminen mit anderen Firmen dort auch meistens den Chef. Diese Möglichkeit haben nur Wenige in meinem Alter. Gleichzeitig bin ich oft bei Landwirten zu Besuch. Dort erfährt man immer eine unglaubliche Gastfreundschaft. Da kann es schon vorkommen, dass man statt geplant einer Stunde den ganzen Nachmittag am Bauernhof verbringt und auch noch zum Abendessen bleibt. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Freundeskreis und meine Familie. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir haben noch keine großen Pläne, sondern versuchen uns Tag für Tag, Woche für Woche voranzuarbeiten. Mal sehen wohin die Reise geht. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Durch meinen Tatendrang. Ich bin ein schlechter Verkäufer. Was ich dafür gut kann, ist Ideen in die Tat umzusetzen. Wenn Leute sehen, auf mich ist Verlass, ich setzte etwas um; das motiviert. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Gerade am Anfang wurde ich schon hin und wieder belächelt. Das Verständnis für so eine Idee bekommt man erst mit der Zeit. Der Großteil meiner Freunde findet es aber toll, dass mein Bruder und ich uns trauen, das Projekt nahgenuss umzusetzen. Mittlerweile sind auch schon erste Erfolge zu sehen, was das Ganze leichter macht. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Ein Buch, dass man unbedingt lesen sollten: Und zwar die Biographie von Teddy Roosevelt „The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt“ von Edmund Morris. Es ist nicht nur eine unglaublich spannende Lebensgeschichte, sondern zeigt auch sehr gut, wie sich die Welt in 100 Jahren verändert hat. Ein Beispiel: Heute wäre es undenkbar, dass ein US-Präsident nicht erreichbar ist. Teddy Roosevelt war oft Wochen alleine in der Wildnis der USA, ohne dass jemand gewusst hätte, wo er genau ist.

Although we have been enjoying our summer here at Impact Hub Vienna, we have not been slacking off too much. And our hard work paid off because in this latest installment from the Success Board, we have some pretty rockin’ successes to celebrate. At the last Wine Down held at the Badeschiff, Community Catalyst Dushan announced the most recent successes at the Hub. To cheers and applause we celebrated four categories of success here at the Hub. Under the category “Next Step” Success we celebrated Organisation Dock12, who just launched Kontexten.org. Günter Strobl and Dock12 are helping businesses better understand the complex context within which they exist, thereby helping them generating a holistic business model. To give you a little context, here is their new website: http://www.kontexten.org/. We also celebrated cooking initiative “Koch Doch” which has officially become an association! They will continue to offer delicious, nutritious home cooked meals for the Impact Hub Vienna community. In case you haven’t checked it out before, be sure to swing by and check in with Barbara Schöllenberger on Thursday’s upstairs where she prepares vegan meals every week. We also celebrated BLITAB, this years Social Impact Award winner. They recently launched the beta version of their tablet for blind and visually impaired people. BLITAB Technology, developed the first-ever tactile tablet, which uses a new liquid-based technology to create a tactile tablet experience similar to Braille. The tablet can also produce tactile graphics and maps for the blind and vision impaired. Under the “Getting Acknowledged” category, we celebrated Shades Tour, which made the “Top 40 Things to Do in Austria This Summer” list. Their tours were mentioned among the first five activities. In case you didn’t know they are now offering tours in English, so be sure to check it out. Under the “Founding Something Great” category we celebrated Weitsicht, who recently opened the Sustainable Management Centre in Vienna. They are providing assistance to small and medium sized companies that want to create businesses in a sustainable and socially responsible way. Finally for the “Personal Victory” category we celebrated Annemarie Harant, co-founder of Erdbeerwoche as she was invited to be a speaker for Start-Up Retreat Portugal. Start-Up Retreat is a special project for open-minded entrepreneurs to get together in inspiring places to brainstorm and network. We also celebrated author Maja Monrue on the publication of her first book called “A Book For Men” and on her recent engagement! We want to keep you inspired so be sure to add your successes to our Success Board on the first floor of the Hub and we will feature you in September’s Town Hall/Summer Party Event which is taking place on September 22nd.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/09/07/education-is-the-way-forward/","ImpactHub","Education is the way forward","Education is the path forward; the path forward out of poverty, for sustainable growth and development, and for continual innovation. Creating inclusive and affordable education initiatives to help children and families grow within healthy communities is the focus of some ventures in Impact Hub Vienna. The development of new skills to help our children thrive in the future business landscape is essential. As a society, new educational approaches and initiatives are needed and several Impact Hub Vienna Members are creating new methods and means of educating children from within the current formal system and expanding the reach of education beyond the classroom. Talentify is creating better educational opportunities for students within the current school system. For Talentify, education is partially inherited through parental education levels and income level. This has a twofold effect on education of children from lower income families, it often means that they cannot access help at home and that private tutoring to advance in subject areas is unaffordable. Talentify proposes a social exchange platform between peers that would allow students to teach each other and gain valuable job related skills in the process. This removes the financial burden from students and their families as well as creates a valuable platform for all students to skill share. Schule im Aufbruch wants to create a better classroom for children to develop their full potential as creative thinkers and problem-solvers. The purpose of their venture is to create inspiring classroom environments that are more responsive to the individual needs of children. They work with community and school leaders to change the way education is perceived and the classroom environment functions. Schule im Aufbruch has created an exchange platform with educational experts to help teachers move students towards a sense of personal responsibility for their education as opposed to a duty to fulfill their educational requirements. In an increasingly complex and global financial environment navigating one’s personal finances is becoming more difficult to understand. Three Coins fills that knowledge gap by providing easily accessible and understanding financial literacy tools. Their flagship product, CURE Runners, is the award winning smartphone app that teaches young and old alike about financial literacy; education through gamificiation. Three Coins is launching a new smartphone app that allows an individual to learn about their financial behaviour without numbers; with graphic displays and an intuitive format anyone can learn about their own budget and financial literacy. Neuwal is working on education in politics. With the upcoming elections for Bundespräsident in Austria, every vote is critical. To address this issue, Dieter Zirnig organized the Langer Tag der Politik, an Austrian-wide event that helped bring students and first time voters up to speed on everything regarding the election. It was hugely successful, reaching over 5.000 students across the entire country. In lieu of the revote taking place on October 2nd, Neuwal has organized PopUp Politik, a workshop tailored to educate voters on the candidates and issues that are important for the revote this fall.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/books-education-school-literature-48126-600x400.jpg","September 7, 2016","en",0.991419792175293,9.78315438260324e-05,0.885965347290039,0.000140222779009491,0.113796606659889
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/09/16/european-forum-alpbach/","ImpactHub","European Forum Alpbach","What started as a gathering of students in 1945 has become one of the must-attend events on Austria’s calendar. The European Forum Alpbach gathers together industry thought leaders from the arenas of science, politics, business and culture every year for 3 weeks of conversations that shape Austria’s future. In fact, this year there were 939 speakers and more than 3,600 visitors from 90 different countries! Impact Hub Vienna has been involved with the forum for the past 7 years, but it was only this year that we were able to break through the glass ceiling. This year Impact Hub Vienna was included in the closing plenary of the political symposium, cementing its role as a key player in the forum and bringing in other Impact Hubs across Europe. Not only are we changing the format of this conversation, we are sitting front and center. “We are looking back at a long and fruitful partnership with the European Forum Alpbach and it is fantastic to see that we have been able to extend this partnership to the European Impact Hub network. A rapidly growing number of institutions and decision makers are realising the need to combine a top-down policy making approach with the energy of the growing bottom-up grassroots movement, which the Impact Hub network is representing, in order to maximise impact. The European Forum Alpbach is the perfect platform for these forces to merge and we are honoured to have been invited to sit at the table.” Matthias Reisinger, Co-found & Director, Impact Hub Vienna Because of the relationship developed by Impact Hub Vienna, this year, 14 Impact Hubs from across Europe were represented at the forum. Gabriela Gandal, Managing Director of Impact Hub was asked to chair the plenary on sustainable development, which was comprised of ventures from Impact Hubs across Europe. The mere existence of this plenary is proof that the work of the Impact Hub network is being seen as integral to the future of Vienna. During this plenary, Simon Schmitz, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Office of clean energy provider aWATTar this year was a speaker and spoke with passion about his work, a cleaner future and the role of social entrepreneurs in creating change. This couldn’t be truer for Impact Hubs, where social entrepreneurs gather every day to take action on things that matter most. Other entrepreneurs from the Impact Hub network that spoke during the plenary included: Baptiste Carriere-Pradal, VICE PRESIDENT EUROPE, SUSTAINABLE APPAREL COALITION, AMSTERDAM Mona Mijthab, FOUNDER & DESIGNER, MOSAN MOBILE SANITATION, ZURICH Paula Peters, GLOBAL DIRECTOR LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT, CHANGE.ORG, BERLIN Jeffrey D. Sachs, DIRECTOR, THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK Clare Sutcliffe, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CODE CLUB; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITIES & OUTREACH, RASPBERRY PI FOUNDATION, LONDON With so many Impact Hubs in the same location, this gathering could be viewed as a test case for an annual internal European Impact Hub event, allowing all Hub’s to have their voice as part of the conversation. “In the past years, the global Impact Hub movement really helped put social entrepreneurship on the map. Don’t underestimate its power in creating communities of peer-to-peer learning, inspiration and co-creation. The coming years will show if it can also help advocate for a radical transformation of our economic system. Does the Hub network have concepts at hand what a post-carbon society should look like? Opportunities for ‘utopian’ ideas to gain traction might not be so far away, so it better be prepared for the next challenge.” Philippe Narval, Managing Director/European Forum Alpbach So what is the next phase of the conversation? Only time will tell, but it will be sure to be a conversation you will want to be a part of. All photos courtesy of https://www.facebook.com/forumalpbach/.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/09/21/julian-wudy-und-christoph-zinganell-wir-wollen-die-energiezukunft-aktiv-mitgestalten/","ImpactHub","Julian Wudy und Christoph Zinganell: “Wir wollen die Energiezukunft aktiv mitgestalten.”","Seit Julian Wudy denken kann, interessiert er sich für Umweltfragen und hat daher an der Universität für Bodenkultur Umwelt- und Bioressourcenmanagement studiert, die Begeisterung für gesellschaftliche Prozesse hat ihn außerdem dazu bewogen Politikwissenschaften an der Universität Wien zu inskribieren. Mehrjährige Berufserfahrung beim Klima- und Energiefonds, beim EU-Umweltbüro des Umweltdachverbandes sowie als Universitätsassistent an der Universität für Bodenkultur haben ihn auf die Gründung von Collective Energy vorbereitet. Julian möchte mit Collective Energy mehr Menschen und Unternehmen die Möglichkeit geben die Energiezukunft aktiv mitzugestalten. Bereits im Kindesalter war Christoph Zinganell von Sonnennergie fasziniert und wuchs in seinem familiären Umfeld mit effizientem Denken und Handeln im Mostviertel auf. Nach dem Bachelor-Studium der Elektrotechnik (TU Wien) besuchte er die Universität für Bodenkultur, wo er den Master Energiemanagement und Umweltpolitik mit Auszeichnung abschloss. Dort wurde auch die Idee von Collective Energy geboren. Nach einer 7-monatigen Reise durch Zentral- und Südamerika im Jahr 2014 traf er gemeinsam mit Julian Wudy die Entscheidung Collective Energy von einer studentischen Initiative in ein professionelles Unternehmen überzuführen. Christoph sieht in Collective Energy eine Chance gemeinsam die Energiewende voran zu treiben. Julian und Christoph sind seit der Gründung im November 2015 geschäftsführende Gesellschafter der Collective Energy GmbH. Collective Energy ist ein junges Unternehmen das Energie gemeinschaftlich denkt. Durch eine Neuinterpretation des Crowdfundingkonzeptes im Zusammenhang mit Gutscheinen als Rückzahlungsinstrument werden Unternehmen und Vereine in die Lage versetzt gemeinsam mit den eigenen Kunden kostengünstiger auf Solarenergie umzusteigen und zusätzlich von Kundenbindungseffekten zu profitieren. Jeder Einzelne kann so über kleine Beträge Unternehmen unterstützen auf Solarenergie umzusteigen und von Preisvorteilen für Produkte und Dienstleistungen des täglichen Bedarfs profitieren. Was treibt Euch an? Der aktuelle Stillstand und der Wille etwas zu verändern. Das für unsere Zukunft immens wichtige Thema Energie aus dem Schattendasein zu holen und die Menschen für dieses Thema zu sensibilisieren. Wann habt Ihr die Photovoltaik für Euch entdeckt? Weil sie sich mit einem unserer Grundgedanken gut verbinden lässt: Energie soll dort produziert werden wo sie auch verbraucht wird. Und Sonnenenergie ist nicht nur reichlich vorhanden sie lässt sich mit modernen Speichersystemen auch überall und zu jeder Zeit nutzen. Wie habt Ihr diese „demokratische“ Finanzierung für Photovoltaik Anlagen entwickelt? Was ist daran so besonders? Uns ging es darum einen Weg zu finden mehr Menschen für den Umweltschutz und erneuerbare Energien zu begeistern und in weiterer Folge in den Prozess der Energiewende zu integrieren. Das Besondere ist, dass wir eine Möglichkeit geschaffen haben, welche allen Menschen wie Dir & Mir die Möglichkeit gibt den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien zu finanzieren indem sie Produkte und Dienstleistungen des täglichen Bedarfs kaufen. Durch eine Vielzahl an kleinen Geldbeträgen, werden größere Projekte realisierbar und Menschen unterstützen damit Betriebe direkt auf Solarenergie umzusteigen. Sie kaufen z.B. Wein und der Winzer verpflichtet sich mit den erzielten Erlösen eine Solaranlage zu bauen. So entsteht eine Win-Win-Win-Situation von der neben dem Unternehmer und dem Kunden auch die Umwelt profitiert. Der Unternehmer profitiert von einem kostengünstigeren Umstieg auf Solarenergie und langfristigen Kundenbindungseffekten, die Unterstützer von attraktiven Einkaufsvorteilen und die Umwelt von reduzierten CO2-Emissionen. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Es gab mehrere Momente die uns bestärkt haben Collective Energy zu gründen. Der wichtigste war wohl, dass wir rasch unser erstes Pilotprojekt umgesetzt haben und dadurch den Glauben an die eigene Idee gefestigt haben und auf viel positive Resonanz von außen gestoßen sind. Wie habt Ihr euch gefunden? Durch eine gemeinsame Lehrveranstaltung an der Universität für Bodenkultur. Es ging darum an einem fiktiven Businessplan zu erarbeiten, wir haben uns rasch entschieden das wir hier nicht nur in der Theorie agieren wollen, sondern zum Handeln übergehen wollen. Was gefällt Euch am Unternehmertum? Genau der oben angesprochene Punkt. Wir bekommen durch Collective Energy die Möglichkeit unsere eigenen Ideen umzusetzen und müssen nicht tatenlos zusehen wie andere in die falsche Richtung steuern. Wir wollen unsern Beitrag leisten indem wir aktiv agieren. Collective Energy gibt uns die Möglichkeit die Zukunft aktiv mitzugestalten. Das begeistert uns! Wen es einmal Knatsch gibt, wie geht Ihr damit um? Wir versuchen daraus zu lernen. Wir sind zum Glück zwei sehr unterschiedliche Persönlichkeiten und haben unterschiedliche Stärken und Schwächen, welche wir dazu nutzen unsere gemeinsame Idee weiterzubringen. Das wichtigste in diesem Zusammenhang ist jedoch nicht nachtragend zu sein, die Dinge offen anzusprechen sowie die Meinung des anderen zu respektieren und so auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu kommen. Wo seht ihr euch mit „Collective Energy“ in einem Jahr? Collective Energy ist gewachsen, hat mehre Projekte umgesetzt und die ersten Mitarbeiter eingestellt. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Weil es keine Alternative dazu gibt. In den etablierten Strukturen fehlt sehr oft der Sinn für Neues bzw. ist das System in Sich zu träge und innovationsfaul. Wir wollen nicht auf Morgen warten, sondern heute Handeln. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Die Energie zweier junger, engagierter Unternehmer die versuchen mit neuen Ideen und Herangehensweisen die Welt etwas besser zu machen. Worauf verzichtet Ihr, um Eure Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf Freizeit, Geld und ausgiebiges Reisen (- was uns wohl am meisten von den drei Dingen schmerzt). Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Auf persönlicher Ebene: die Möglichkeit eigene Ideen zu verfolgen und alles dafür tun zu können diese zur Umsetzung zu bringen. Und natürlich Erfolge zu erleben und zu wissen, dass man selbst dafür verantwortlich ist. Auf gesellschaftlicher Ebene: rund um Collective Energy hat sich ein positives Netzwerk gebildet, dass uns nicht nur darin bestärkt unsere eigenen Ideen voranzubringen, sondern uns auch immer wieder vor Augen führt, dass unser Agieren auch auf gesellschaftlicher Ebene von Relevanz ist. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Es ist schwierig hier einzelne Personen hervorzuheben. Collective Energy ist von so vielen Personen umgeben die die Idee mittragen und weiter voranbringen. Sehr viele Menschen haben mit kleinen und großen Taten dazu beigetragen, dass Collective Energy jetzt dort steht wo es steht und dieser Umstand erfüllt uns einfach mit Dankbarkeit und spornt uns gleichzeitig noch mehr an Collective Energy und unsere Ideen voranzubringen. Den nur gemeinsam kann man Großes bewegen. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Wir sind beide Familienmenschen und sind hier nicht nur von Menschen umgeben mit denen wir die schönen Momente teilen, sondern finden hier auch Unterschlupf und Halt, wenn es nicht passt. Die wichtigsten Bezugspersonen sind aber ohne Zweifel unsere besseren Hälften. Sie erleben alle Up and Downs hautnah mit und sind wichtige Ansprechpartner für alle Lebenslagen, sozusagen unsere Unternehmens-, Lebens- und Strategieberater im Hintergrund. Aber das wichtigste sie “zwingen” uns dazu das Leben außerhalb Collective Energys zu genießen und geben uns so die Kraft für unser unternehmerisches Handeln. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir sprudeln an Ideen wie wir die Welt gemeinsam verbessern und haben definitiv noch ein paar Überraschungen im Petto. Aber in erster Linie hoffen wir, dass uns die Arbeit mit Collective Energy nicht auf eine einsame Insel bringt, denn wir wollen mit Collective Energy das Zündfeuer für einen kollektiven Kraftakt zur Energiewende legen. Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Die Bandbreite ist vielfältig. Von “ich bin sooo unglaublich stolz auf dich und ihr müsst dass unbedingt weitermachen” bis zu “suche dir doch lieber einen sicheren Job und denk an deine Zukunft” ist alles dabei. Habt Ihr Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Gründet kein Unternehmen;-) Aber Spaß beiseite: Der wohl wichtigste Tipp ist an seine eigenen Ideen und Fähigkeiten zu glauben. Man ertappt sich viel zu oft dabei die Schuld bei anderen zu suchen, es ist befreiend die Dinge selbst in die Hand zu nehmen und zu agieren. Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Wenn man aktuell einen Blick auf die Welt wirft tauchen viele Wünsche auf. Unser größtes Anliegen ist es die zwischenmenschliche Interaktion wieder zu verstärken, denn so werden oft Probleme bereits im Keim erstickt und tolle Lösungen entwickelt. Sei es beim Klimaschutz oder in sozialen Fragen, nur gemeinsam können hier entsprechende Lösungen gefunden und die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit bewältigt werden. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Mit offenen Augen durch´s Leben gehen und den größten Medien nicht alles glauben, sondern den Dingen selbst auf den Grund gehen und diese kritisch zu hinterfragen. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Alfred Strigl ….gibt es sonst noch Geschichten, Erfahrungen die Ihr uns erzählen wollt?!?

The Impact of Collective Collaboration"," When you think of computer hackers, you generally picture the 1995 movie Hackers or Penelope Garcia from the show Criminal Minds, people sitting alone in a room filled with computers. However, as I learned at the Impact Hub Vienna Hackathon at Ars Electronica in Linz, nothing could be further from the truth. The Lemmings came to Ars Electronica en masse to show us all what teamwork means. The Lemmings are a group of hackers founded by Thomas Schranz. He started the group in order to get people interested in computer programming and to create new and innovative solutions. While I was at the Ars Electronica Festival, they turned up to show us what they could do. The way that Lemmings usually work is that they meet up at a predetermined location, like a coffee shop, where the theme of the day, subject matter, and actual location are revealed. The group then works as a team to create an innovative chat program based solution, known as a chat bot. Impact Hub Vienna has hosted the Lemmings on several occasions, and they are named after the computer game – in case you were wondering. This was just the latest instance of collaboration between the hacker group and Impact Hub Vienna. I spoke to several individuals about their favorite projects and chat bots. I received a thorough tour of the most famous chat bot, Poncho (unfortunately, this was not created by the Lemmings). Poncho can tell you about the weather and uses natural language processing algorithms to understand what you are saying and respond appropriately. In this case, Gerald Urschitz and I asked Poncho if we needed a jacket to go outside in Linz that day. Poncho responded with “No.” That was likely related to the fact that it was an absolutely gorgeous, sunny day outside. Dominik Felix showed me a chat bot that he was working on. It turns out that it might be possible to ask for help concerning your cable television over Facebook Messenger, and even order your cable products and set up an appointment in your home. He then showed me an innovative business card with a cross between a QR code and a Snapchat function that allows you to start a conversation with someone by scanning his or her business card. I spoke with Kira Zatsepina and learned that she helped create a chat bot that returned movies quotes and pictures based on whatever mood you typed into the question field. For example, if you typed silence into the chat bot it would return one of the many scenes from Pulp Fiction where they stared at each other in complete and utter silence. The bot that Artemis Linhart is most proud of helping to create, is an innovative and fun way to track your package through the post. You type your tracking number into the chat bot and it returns the travel diary of your package along with a picture of your package which has been anthropomorphized and super imposed onto another image. However, as I spoke to the Lemmings about their various projects, people kept directing me to Carina Pfann and her raspberry pi. That is not a typo, by the way. As Carina explained to me, a raspberry pi is a very small and simple Linux computer. Hers was set up in a very colorful case with an LED display. The purpose of this little computer was to display the mood of a conference or event with a simple color based on the various moods and adjectives that participants typed into the chat bot Getso. When you type in a mood, a color comes back on your phone, but also through the LED display. This would change based on the overall mood of the participants. The chat bot does this through what is known as sentiment analysis and is based on a training set from social media. Next time you see a group of Lemmings follow them and see what cool things they might be up to, the computer hackers not the animals!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/header-1-1-600x400.jpg","September 28, 2016","en",0.989090621471405,0.00200867117382586,0.816066443920135,0.00612909905612469,0.17579573392868

Impact Hub is all about growing a locally rooted and globally connected community. Also, we try to create as much positive impact as humanly possible. Ready. Set. Go. But have you ever asked yourself – how we do that exactly? I mean, how do you come up with measurable impact data? You might sense it when you work in Lindengasse 56, hear about an unexpected connection made at the Hub or join one of the community events like the Sexy Salad. But what are the hard cold facts and measurable impact we create as a community? On Thursday 22nd of September we hosted our 2nd TownHall meeting where we brought you up to speed on the developments at the Hub and presented our first ever Impact Report (printed version can be found at reception an online version is coming soon). “But what is the Impact Report?” Well, I’m glad you asked! It’s a 73 page booklet full of facts and figures, supported impact ventures and hosted Programs and Events. And here are some numbers to underline how cool the Impact Report is: In 2015 27,432 hours of support were given from members to members There were over 250 events hosted last year and we are projecting over 450 events for 2016. Also there were 503 new jobs created and 6.6 million clients were reached! If you want to be smacked with more inspirational numbers and pretty Impact Hub pictures, feel free to grab an Impact Report yourself. The Hosts have them at the Welcome Desk and its definitely worth picking one up. The Town Hall was not only about reflecting on our impact from last year, we also asked for YOUR needs and visions. So, three interactive feedback groups were formed, focusing on Strategy2020, Space and Community. Guests joined different groups and we received some well needed input from the community. In Alexis’ strategy brainstorming session, the community showed interest in participating in the development and implementation of our 2020 strategy. As a result, we are going to be hosting quarterly strategy sessions with the community, to keep the improvements coming. Our Space Curator Babsi held a brainstorming session for how we can improve our space. She also revealed some space changes happening in the future such as the Do-It-Yourself Space from Woodsaw which will be opened before the end of 2016. The third breakout session was held by Dushan, our Community Host. He posed the question on how we might inspire, connect, and enable our community? Some of the ideas were: An Open Books Event, one-on-one Coaching and an Impact Hub Marathon Group. If you want to poke around a bit more, you can find some of the other suggestions here and if you want to see these ideas become reality even faster, be sure to get in touch with Dushan at [email protected] If you want to continue the conversation on Space and Strategy, feel free to send your thoughts to: [email protected] and b[email protected] After the feedback sessions we went on to redefine Octoberfest and celebrate collaboration. We brought together classical Weißbier & Weißwurst with innovative Beer Cocktails and connecting games like the Collaboration Bingo. The team from Younited Cultures kicked off their Crowdfunding Campaign and hosted the Diversity Sock Party – where some hilarious pics were created. Be sure to check out the next WineDown on the 20th of October!

It is us and them; city dwellers versus country dwellers, right wing versus left wing, or creative versus corporate. While it seems to be completely natural to divide the world into us and them – this has become our pattern of living and thinking. At Impact Hub Vienna, we wanted to challenge this view of the world and so we created an event to unlearn our regular patterns of living and thinking. And by unlearn – we, of course, mean smashing it to bits by attending the Breaking Patterns Festival on October 25 – 26. Speakers and Guests of Honour The festival will be two days of speakers, workshops, networking events, and seminars. We will be exploring new ways experiencing the world. From Veronika Fiegl, a practitioner in the Grinberg method, who will help you channel your fear and anxiety into amazing drive to Tomáš Sedlácek, the author of The Economics of Good and Evil, where he shatters the paradigm that economics is not about mathematical interpretations of consumer and market behaviour, but in fact a more fundamental and visceral question of ethics. (My) Reality – the Virtual Reality Experience Vrei, the Virtual Reality Lounge down the street, will be hosting a virtual reality event. The VR experience is a paradigm shift in and of itself, with completely immersive sound and video. However, we wanted to show you what life is like in a refugee camp. So Impact Hub Vienna and Vrei have partnered to bring you (My) Reality, an experience like no other to show people the life and conditions that refugees experience in camps around the world. So come on an amazing journey with us and learn how to break your regular patterns. Change your routine for a few days (or longer!) and join us at Impact Hub Vienna for the Breaking Patterns Festival. Check out the website and purchase your tickets.

Congratulations Accelerate Team! This comes hot on the heels of a recent survey conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which ranked the best countries in the world for social entrepreneurship. Impressively, Austria ranked 11th out of 45 countries in terms of female social entrepreneurship. The aim of the survey was to assess the climate of entrepreneurship across the world to see which environments (including political and financial) are most supportive of businesses wishing to make a social impact. In each country surveyed, the Thomas Reuters Foundation contacted 20 experts across the area of social entrepreneurship for their responses. 47.5% of respondents were social entrepreneurs themselves, while the remainder included policymakers, investors, academics and ‘others’. 48% of respondents were women. The top 3 countries may not surprise you – the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, however others in the top 10 might. Israel was ranked 5th, scoring top points for ‘Public Understanding’ meaning that the general public understands what social entrepreneurs do. Chile was ranked 6th, partly due to good government policy that supports social entrepreneurs. In regards to the women’s poll, the top 3 countries are a mixed bag – The Philippines, Russia and Norway. This assessment was based on 2 aspects – the gender gap and representation in leadership roles (in social enterprises). The areas where Austria preformed slightly better than average included: Social entrepreneurship gaining momentum Social entrepreneur access to the non-financial support they need (e.g. financial, legal and technical advice; access to markets and networks; coaching, mentoring and training) These factors go a long way in showing that soon – maybe even next year – Austria will rank even better.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/10/29/ein-interview-mit-geri-kriechbaum/","ImpactHub","Ein Interview mit Geri Kriechbaum","“Ich finde es spannend mit Kleidung ein Statement, eine Einstellung transportieren zu können.” Geri Kriechbaum ist 26 Jahre alt und kommt aus dem Bezirk Vöcklabruck in Oberösterreich. Geri hat einen ganz „normalen“ Lebensweg durchgemacht – Volksschule, Hauptschule, HTL und dann eben der 9-5 Job, wie man es halt NORMAL so macht. Im Jahr 2014 hat er sich zum ersten Mal die Frage gestellt: Was ist eigentlich los ist, wenn ich diesen Job aus irgend einem Grund nicht mehr habe? Was würde ich machen? Er ist dann sehr rasch zu der Entscheidung gekommen aus seiner Leidenschaft zum Zeichnen, aber auch für´s Marketing ein kleines Business nebenbei zu starten. Geri hat seinen „sicheren” Job als Maschinenbau Konstrukteur gekündigt und sich für ein Studium für Kommunikations-wissenschaften eingetragen, um für sein Unternehmen dazulernen zu können und sich mehr auf seine Leidenschaft konzentrieren zu können. Stroncton ist eine Lifestylebrand für Menschen die genau das machen was sie lieben, die unserer Gesellschaft und Umwelt etwas zurückgeben und einen positiven Einfluss auf unsere Zukunft haben wollen. Diese Marke steht für faire und umweltbewusst hergestellte Produkte, sie unterstützt mit jedem Verkauf Charity-/ Tierschutz- oder Umweltschutzprojekte. Ein großes Ziel ist es dem Kunden ein gutes und schönes Gefühl mitzugeben. Was treibt Dich an? Was mich am meisten antreibt sind meine Träume und Ziele. Ich möchte eines Tages aufstehen und wissen, dass ich jetzt genau das machen kann was mir Spaß macht – sprich, ich will mein Hobby zum Beruf machen. Es ist dann nicht mehr das Gefühl von „arbeiten zu MÜSSEN“ sondern ich darf genau das machen, was meine Berufung ist. Mit meiner Arbeit möchte ich etwas gutes für unsere Zukunft bewirken: Ich möchte Hilfsorganisationen für Menschen, Tiere und Natur unterstützen. Und genau so möchte ich dann natürlich auch meinen Lebensunterhalt verdienen und mein eigener Chef sein. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Mode entdeckt? Leidenschaft für Mode ist vielleicht zu übertrieben ich würde eher Design als meine Leidenschaft bezeichnen. In meiner Skateboard-Zeit war ich schon immer von verschiedenen Marken wie Volcom, Emerica, Flip und aktuell Picture, Brixton, Famous usw. fasziniert. Sie alle bringen einen besonderen Lifestyle auf die Straße der mich begeistert. Mit viel Liebe zum Detail und „out of the box“ Designs verleihen sie deren Marke etwas besonderes. Ich wollte schon im Jahr 2005 ein Label gründen, jedoch war dann irgendwie Schule usw. wichtiger. <U+0001F609> ….und warum dann gleich fair und nachhaltig? Das hat sich daraus ergeben, dass ich immer öfter von echt schlimmen Vorfällen gehört habe die mir teilweise echt sorgen bereiten…sei es von Kinderarbeit, Arbeitszeiten die sich bei uns niemand vorstellen könnte oder Arbeitsbedingungen wo man bei uns den Laden sofort dicht machen würde. Warum sollen Menschen auf der anderen Seite der Erde unter schlechteren Bedingungen arbeiten müssen als bei uns?? Nur damit wir billigst irgendwelche Massenwaren kaufen können?!?!? Weiters hat mir die Backpack-Reise mit meiner Freundin durch Vietnam die Augen geöffnet. Wunderschöne Strände…doch überall Plastikmüll und Styroporverpackungen. Das war teilweise echt nicht schön anzusehen. Und deshalb war für mich von Anfang an klar, dass alle Produkte von Stroncton zu 100% fair und umweltbewusst hergestellt werden. Mit deinem Kleidungslabel orientierst du dich sehr stark an nachhaltigen und umweltbewussten Prinzipien und darüber geht es dir ja auch noch um den guten Zweck. Wie zeigt sich das konkret? Genau, also dieser Punkt ist uns besonders wichtig. Wir möchten somit einen Beitrag dazu leisten, das Gleichgewicht wieder herzustellen. Mit jedem verkauften Produkt wollen wir einen guten Zweck unterstützen. Mit unserer ersten Line (The Stroncton Human Line) arbeiten wir mit skate-aid zusammen . Hierbei werden 10% vom Verkaufspreis an skate-aid gespendet und somit können Skateparks gebaut und Skateboards für Kinder in armen Ländern zu verfügung gestellt werden. Wir haben noch viele coole Projekte auf unserer Ideen Liste, die werden jetzt eben nach und nach umgesetzt um möglichst viele coole gute Sachen zu unterstützen. Und genau so kommen wir zum nächsten Punkt bzw. zur nächsten Frage <U+0001F642> Was macht dein Modelabel so besonders? Bei uns gehts nicht darum so viel Kohle wie möglich zu machen – klar, das Ziel wäre irgendwann mal davon leben zu können. Aber dieser Prozess wird einfach dauern und wir wollen Stroncton nachhaltig und mit einem starken Fundament aufbauen. Daher hat sich auch unser Social-Media Hashtag abgeleitet: #heartoverbucks Soll soviel heißen, dass wir Mensch / Tier und Umwelt über den Profit stellen und darauf besonders achten. Es bedeutet aber auch, dass wir (zumindest jeden Tag ein wenig) das machen sollen was uns Spaß macht, was wir lieben und nicht immer gleich darauf schauen, ob dabei genug Geld rausschaut. Wir wollen unseren Kunden ein besonderes Gefühl mitgeben – er unterstützt ja mit jedem Kauf einen guten Zweck, und somit braucht man nicht einmal ein schlechtes Gewissen haben wenn man bei Stroncton einkauft, haha <U+0001F642> Weiters werden unsere Produkte mit viel Liebe zum Detail hergestellt, verpackt usw. Es kann auch sein, dass bei einem Päckchen von Stroncton auch die eine oder andere Überaschung zu finden ist <U+0001F642> Wir wollen dem Kunden einfach eine tolle Erfahrung bieten, denn unsere Produkte sind eben für die coolsten Menschen der Welt. Was macht Mode für dich so spannend? Ich find es einfach spannend mit T-Shirts, Hoodies usw. ein Statement, eine Einstellung transportieren zu können, und somit kann es jeder sehen. Mit dem Branding wird die Marke mit Werte und Zielen bestücken und über das Medium T-Shirt zum Beispiel werden diese hinaus getragen. Weiters find ich es einfach toll zu sehen, wenn Menschen ein glückliches Lächeln im Gesicht haben wenn sie zB. ein T-Shirt kaufen welches ihnen besonders gut gefällt. Ich finds einfach cool Menschen zum lächeln zu bringen. Kann Mode einen Beitrag für eine bessere Welt leisten? Definitiv. Und ich bin mir sicher, dass so ziemlich jede Branche einen Beitrag leisten kann. Schon alleine, wenn man eben nicht mehr die „Dollarzeichen“ im Fokus hat, sondern eben das wirklich wichtige. Wenn nicht Stroncton, was würdest du sonst machen? Das ist eine gute Frage…ich würde mich wahrscheinlich an den Schreibtisch setzen, kritzeln, irgendwann mal denken „hey…das sieht ja gar nicht so blöd aus“. Dafür würde ich mir einen Namen überlegen, und dann wieder eine Brand starten <U+0001F642> Auf jeden Fall würde ich wieder etwas beginnen, wo ich zu 100% Spaß daran habe. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja, ich bin echt verdammt neugierig was neue Sachen anbelangt. Am Anfang bin ich teilweise immer ein echter Scheisser, aber ich versuchs dann trotzdem das eine oder andere auszuprobieren und zu wagen. Beispiel eine Rede an der FH Krems zu halten…ich wollte unbedingt wissen wie Stroncton rüber kommt…das erfahre ich aber nur wenn ich mich dem eben stelle und es ausprobiere. Aus Fehlern lernt man unheimlich viel, darum bin ich echt immer ziemlich offen für alles <U+0001F642> Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Dich nicht geben würde? Ein Haufen blöder Sprüche..haha Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zurzeit: Großteils im Wohnzimmer welches gleichzeitig mit einem Schreibtisch ausgestattet ist. Mein Ziel ist jedoch von überall aus arbeiten zu können wo ich WLAN habe, zumindest für meine Design-Arbeiten. Sei es am See oder irgendwo in einem Hostel in Vietnam, das wär schon echt cool. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In letzter Zeit ziemlich oft aufs Fortgehen am Wochenende, auf das lange Ausschlafen am Wochenende und aufs längere Schlafen unter der Woche. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste dabei ist meine Ideen als erstes auf Papier zu zeichnen und diese dann auf T-Shirts oder Hoodies usw. zu bringen. Diese Produkte finden dann Platz bei Menschen auf der ganzen Welt die mit ihrem Kauf super glücklich sind. Gleichzeitig wurde auch noch einem Kind in Tansania ermöglicht Skateboard fahren zu können und einen coolen Tag zu haben. Dieser Gedanke macht mich extrem happy <U+0001F642> Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Auf jeden Fall meine Freundin Vanessa, meine Eltern, Geschwister und verdammt coole Freunde die mir immer wieder unter die Arme greifen. Meine Mum hilft mir zB. beim Labels anbringen, mein Bruder macht Produktfotos, meine Freundin hilft mir in der Buchhaltung und meine Freunde unterstützen mich on the Road bei Märkten und Pop Up Shops. IHR SEIT ECHT DIE GEILSTEN <U+0001F642> Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Meine Freundin gibt mir echt immer motivierende Worte wenns gerade nicht so läuft oder wenn gerade mal ein Durchhänger aktuell ist. Das ist echt sehr sehr cool. Auch meine Eltern machen mir immer wieder Mut meinen Weg zu gehen. Bin echt dankbar dafür, dass sie so hinter mir stehen. Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir haben noch einiges vor, ja <U+0001F642> Aber das wird nach und nach ans Tageslicht geholt. Jetzt hab ich auch endlich mehr Zeit für alles, und die Story beginnt dann erst so richtig <U+0001F642> Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Indem ich selbst zu 110% begeistert und motiviert bin ist es viel einfacher andere Menschen zu begeistern. Das liegt glaub ich einfach daran, dass es wirklich genau das ist was ich machen möchte <U+0001F642> und was noch wichtig ist, auch über sich selbst lachen zu können wenn man mal etwas verbockt hat <U+0001F642> Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden es echt cool dass ich mich so einsetze und unterstützen mich echt super. TOP. Ich weiß, dass es teilweise blöd ist, da ich beim einen oder anderen Treffen nicht dabei sein kann, aber sie haben immer volles Verständnis und das ist echt toll. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Oh ja, da gibts einige. Ich habe das letzte Buch eigentlich für meine Matura gelesen und mir gedacht…ok…lesen ist nicht mein ding. Aber seit einem Jahr lese ich jeden Tag und es ist echt Hammer. Ich lerne somit immer etwas Neues. Also hier meine hier ein paar Empfehlungen: Matthew Mockridge – Dein nächstes großes Ding Tim Ferris – Die 4 Stundenwoche Alex Hartmann – Mit dem Elefanten durch die Wand Austin Kleon – Show Your Work Anthony Robbins – Unlimited Power Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Den David Lugmayr von Easygoinc Longboard bzw. das Team von Easygoinc Longboards. Die machen ziemlich coole Sachen, und ich denke, die folgen auch ihrer Leidenschaft <U+0001F642> ….gibt es sonst noch Geschichten, Erfahrungen die du uns erzählen willst?!? Auch wenn dir das Gesicht sprichwörtlich mit der Faust geschminkt wird – immer wieder einmal mehr aufstehen, immer nach vorne schauen und die positiven Aspekte an einer vielleicht negativen Situation suchen! Es können sich da wirklich mega coole Sachen daraus ergeben!! Niemals an etwas festbeißen, dass in der Vergangenheit liegt. <U+0001F642> Das hab ich halt gelernt als wir eine ziemlich große Firma in der Kleidungsindustrie bzgl. dem vorigen Namen an der Backe hatten. Es wird immer wieder Höhen und Tiefen, Sommer und Winter geben, mann muss nur wissen, dass nach einem Winter auch wieder der Sommer kommt <U+0001F609> facebook Instagram ","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSC9857-600x400.jpg","October 29, 2016","de",0.998739123344421,0.000163079700238692,0.349145274143666,0.00152933745024105,0.649162345876296

How often do you eat at a different restaurant or try a drink other than your ‘usual’? How often do you think outside the box? Too often we get caught in futile patterns and developed habits, limiting our creativity and free thinking. Here at Impact Hub we believe that understanding our patterns brings us closer to a society driven by collaboration, openness, trust & fairness. Breaking Patterns is a festival that celebrates and encourages thinking differently. More than 170 participants took part in presentations, workshops and exhibitions which forced them to use a part of their brain that is usually tucked away and resting in a corner. How did we do this? We pulled together the best presenters and exhibitors from a range of topics, including virtual reality, blockchain technology, leadership, economic growth, diversity and the way we work. We used a variety of locations throughout the 7th district in Vienna to stimulate conversation, challenge frameworks and foster positive development. Throughout the course of the event, participants could chose attend sessions that stimulated them. First up was the choice between financial technology (blockchain technology) and an intriguingly titled session ‘Burning out? – From fucking yourself up to effectively achieving your goals’. Shermin Voshmgir, founder of BlockchainHub talked about what Blockchain was and how a decentralized web is the way forward, challenging the old system of technology where the server is King and instead implement a system where information is verified by a peer-to-peer network. Shermin Voshmgir talking to the group about Blockchain. Over in Grinberg Practice, Veronika Fiegl a senior trainer of the Grinberg Method, taught us how to listen to your body to change your life patterns. Later in the afternoon reality was brought home to participants in the (My Virtual) Reality session, when they viewed a video report by Austrian daily newspaper Wiener Zeitung. The report showed life in the Lebanese refugee camp Moussa Taleb not far from the Syrian border and introduced us to teenagers Aysha and Abdallah. After this report, participants were able to meet and speak with Adib that lives in a shared flat for refugees in “Magdas Hotel”. We discussed diversity with experts across the fields of education, LGBTIQ, age, migration, homelessness. We talked about why it is important to break down the silos and have real conversations to break down prejudices and disintegration that lead to polarization and conflict. Presenters Elena, Markus and Tobias talked about working within new management structures and practices and how this can enhance our work. This is a break from the traditional employment and structure and encourages employees to work better together. Elena Tzara (Premium Cola), Markus Stelzmann (Tele Haase), Tobias Göllner (ShiftYard) during ‘The way we work’ presentation. During the entertaining and humorous presentation by Tomáš Sedlácek, he discussed empty promises and unfulfilled desires leading to multiple depressive elements of growth-capitalism. You can view the live stream of this chat on Facebook. Christian Felber and Tomáš Sedlácek during the Economic Growth session Amongst all these sessions participants were able to wander through our space and view the Breaking Patterns exhibition, put on by 4 talented artists, as well as an installation by Sebastian Rahs and Rainer Wachter of Woodsaw. After a huge afternoon, participants gathered at Gallery Westlicht to enjoy dinner from Iss Mich and wrap up the day. 8 presenters were selected from the 8 groups and had 3 mins each to summarise. Not all the presenters were the group leaders – some were participants who instead of simply giving a wrap up, told inspiring stories about how the session impacted them.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/11/04/tedx-out-there/","ImpactHub","TEDx – Out There","TEDx Vienna’s 2016 ‘OUT THERE’ event happened. And it was amazing. For those of you that are unfamiliar with TEDx, it is a conference based on the TED Talks format, organized locally by volunteers. Speakers at TEDx events come from all over the world and across every discipline. Impact Hub Vienna loves Out There ideas and so we decided to head out to the TEDx conference to see what it was all about. In this post we bring back some of the conference experiences for you and what we saw at our booth. The Event ModeratorsA group of us went to TEDx early on Saturday morning to set up a mini Hub at the event, complete with all the comforts of Impact Hub Vienna. There was a chill out corner piled high with colourful cushions, a table that people could work at if they wished, a charging station and iPads to view our new digital members wall (which was really cool). If you haven’t filled out your member profile then you are missing out! And so is everyone else at Impact Hub Vienna – pictures on the digital members wall mean that people will recognize you and can read up on your projects in advance. It is a little like being a celebrity. When my picture and profile came up on the board, I was astounded. People kept stopping by and we made a number of connections and handed out free day passes. So do not be surprised if you see some new faces sitting at the Impact Hub co-workign tables or the hosts taking people on tours through out the Hub! We also had some interesting conversations as a result of the TEDx speakers – everything from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity and the Twin Paradox to questions of medical ethics as a result of the CRISPR project, which uses viruses to perform a process known as genome editing, was discussed. Jacob SmilgThe expert speakers came from a range of areas, including cosmoparticle physics and time travel (or theoretical physics as the discipline is actually known). The youngest student at Oxford University, 11-year old Joshua Beckford, composed a particularly poignant and poetic call to help the planet, which he read on-stage to an enraptured audience. A young American innovator named Jacob Smilg took the stage to tell us about his experiences making a communication device for his friend who suffers from severe disabilities. The final speakers of the day encouraged us to be open-minded about all of our experiences, including mortician Caitlin Doughty appealing to us to think for ourselves and become more involved in the processes of living and dying. Caitlin DoughtyRemember, no idea is truly out of reach and TEDx Vienna proved that there is someone working on the ideas that you think are the most out there. Take inspiration from the speakers at TEDx and keep working on your idea, project, or venture. Every one of these speakers had to overcome obstacles in order to fulfill their dreams, from the belief that time travel is impossible, to the assumption that you cannot cure genetic diseases or overcome autism. So go dream BIG!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TEDx-Out-There-cover-photo-ed-png-600x400.png","November 4, 2016","en",0.994773328304291,4.79025584354531e-05,0.0492067411541939,0.000849767529871315,0.949895620346069

Giving old clothes a new life","On the last Sunday of October, Hub Members, friends, friends of friends, and a few curious passersby stepped out of the chill of a dreary day to spend a fun and warm afternoon at Impact Hub for the year’s first Hub Swap event. The swap first started as a small clothing swap between Laura Mosquera and a few friends but quickly grew and grew to the point where Laura decided to open it up to others. Fueled by coffee from the Iss mich Bistro and a buffet of delicious home-made desserts which included spice cake, marble cake, and banana-coconut muffins, everyone made good use of the fitting rooms as they swapped their old clothes to search for something new. A large selection of clothing was available from your standard sweaters and t-shirts to accessories like bracelets, earrings, and everyone’s favourite eel tie. Heels, sandals, bags, purses, trainers, hats, shawls, blazers, there was something for everyone. There was even a Dirndl up for grabs! As the afternoon turned to evening, after plenty of clothes had been swapped and the event was about to end, there were some items left. Clothing imbued with the history of their previous owners, of relaxing afternoons and parties gone by lay patiently on tables still waiting for a second or possibly even a third life. I wondered what would happen to them. Would they get another chance? Good news! They would. All clothes that were leftover from the Hub Swap were donated to Caritas. A big thank you to the main organizers of the Hub Swap: Laura, Sophie, Johanna, Taki, Julia, and all the volunteers who contributed like Tina, Helena, and Nadine. And another special thanks to Danae for opening up the Iss mich Bistro on a Sunday afternoon. If you were too busy and missed this wonderful event, don’t worry! As a result of extremely positive feedback and demand, a future Hub Swap event is in the works. The target date is sometime next year so stay tuned!

ShiftYard’s Ziel ist es, Menschen zu ermöglichen, die Zukunft ihrer Organisationen mitzugestalten und eigene Impulse innerhalb des Unternehmens zu setzen. Tobias begeistert sich dabei für “Corporate Entrepreneurship” und (digitale) Produkt- und Serviceentwicklung, inspiriert von Start-ups und Silicon Valley Giganten. Zu seinen Kunden zählen sowohl Großunternehmen als auch Start-up Inkubatoren. Auf die Zeit in einem Salzburger Kreativgymnasium folgte bei ihm ein klassisches WU-Studium, eine lehrreiche Zeit in der Strategieberatung, der Schwenk in die Start-up Szene mit dem Aufbau der Innovation-Unit “Discover” bei Pioneers.io und die Gründung von ShiftYard im September 2014. Was treibt Dich an? Ich sehe, dass Menschen heute oft nicht mehr nur brav ihre Pflicht erfüllen wollen, sondern mit ihren eigenen Ideen und Impulsen die Zukunft ihrer Unternehmen gestalten möchten. Davon profitiert dann auch das Unternehmen selbst, da bin ich überzeugt und da möchte ich mit dem Thema Entrepreneurship & Intrapreneurship beitragen. Wann hast Du das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship für dich entdeckt? Meine erste persönliche unternehmerische Erfahrung habe ich bei der Organisation von Drum’n’Bass Clubbings gemacht. Wir haben damals elektronische Musik produziert und der einfachste Weg sie einem Publikum zu präsentieren war selbst Events zu organisieren. Der unternehmerische Aspekt dabei hat mir dann aber genauso gut gefallen wie der künstlerische. Der unternehmerische Background in der Familie, die Studienzeit, das Umfeld in der Strategieberatung und vor allem meine Zeit beim Start-up Netzwerk Pioneers haben dazu geführt, dass ich mich jetzt auch auf einer anderen Ebene damit beschäftige. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Diese Geschichte war auch irgendwie einer der Auslöser für die Gründung von ShiftYard: Für einen Innovationstag eines großen österreichischen Unternehmens hatten wir u.a. auch Start-ups eingeladen, deren Pitch-Zeit über eine Verkehrsampel gesteuert wurde. Zwei Wochen später klingelte dann das Telefon und unser Kunde wollte sich die Ampel ausborgen um die Redezeit im internen Meeting zu begrenzen – „weil da immer Alle so lange quasseln.“ Da hat man also den „Elevator Pitch“ von der Start-up Welt kopiert. Was ist das besondere an ShiftYard? Was ist bei Euch anders? Wir sind ein Netzwerkunternehmen, das heißt wir gestalten die Projekte für unsere Kunden zwar selbst, holen aber immer Top-Freelancer aus unserem Netzwerk mit dazu, die bei neuen (oft digitalen) Themen führend sind. So arbeiten wir mit Innovationsteams an neuen Produkten und Services und unterstützen gleichzeitig auch die Schaffung der notwendigen kulturellen und organisatorischen Voraussetzungen im Unternehmen, z.B. über Intrapreneurship. Wie schaut ein Arbeitstag bei Tobias Göllner aus? Am liebsten bin ich direkt beim Kunden. Ansonsten fühlen wir uns im Co-Working Space ImpactHub sehr wohl, viele Leute mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, haben wir auch dort kennen gelernt. Du arbeitest ja sehr viel mit Menschen, auch aus unterschiedlichen Ländern, zusammen. Was fasziniert dich dabei? Ich finde man sieht oft die guten Seiten der Globalisierung, nämlich dass wir einen globalen Austausch haben, beispielsweise was Produktentwicklungsmethoden betrifft. Die Profis in Europa arbeiten mit den gleichen Tools wie die im Silicon Valley. Wenn man dann dort ist, merkt man einerseits, dass wir hier wie dort alle “mit Wasser kochen” und trotzdem von den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen profitieren. Was gefällt Dir am Unternehmertum? Selbst verantwortlich zu sein für Erfolg und Misserfolg. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Ich habe viel Zeit im Start-up Umfeld verbracht und dabei meine Leidenschaft für das Thema Innovation bzw. Produkt- und Serviceentwicklung gefunden. Gleichzeitig sieht man, dass vielen Menschen in Unternehmen das Methodenwissen dazu fehlt, und daher weniger Ideen umgesetzt werden, als eigentlich möglich. ShiftYard soll dazu beitragen, dass Konzepte öfter, schneller, nutzerorientierter und damit erfolgreicher umgesetzt werden. Du könntest wahrscheinlich auch einen feinen Bürojob haben, warum hast Du dich für den Weg in die Selbständigkeit entschieden? Selbstständig macht man sich nur, wenn es auch gerade zur jeweiligen Lebenssituation passt. Bei mir war es einfach auch genau die richtige Zeit, um das Abenteuer zu wagen. Mit der Entscheidung zwischen Fixanstellung und Selbständigkeit wählt man denke ich auch einen Lifestyle. Es gibt aber auf jeden Fall auch coole Jobs in größeren Unternehmen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Zu sehen, dass unsere Kunden am Ende des Tages wirklich etwas umsetzen. Wir wollen dafür sorgen, dass nichts für die Schublade produziert wird. Bist Du eine neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich interessiere mich sehr für neue Technologien und teste da gerne neue Lösungen, sowohl privat als auch für das Unternehmen (z.B. Produktivitätstools). Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Das sind von privater Seite meine Frau und unsere Familien und im täglichen Business unser Partnernetzwerk. ShiftYard ist ein Netzwerkunternehmen, wir leben Kooperation sehr offen und machen Projekte gemeinsam und vertrauensvoll. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Mein Ziel war immer selbstständig, aber als Team zu operieren, in dem man sich auch gegenseitig weiter bringt. Da bin ich sehr froh darüber, mit Michael Thurow und Ulla Bartel zusammen zu arbeiten. Wohin wird Dich diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Ja, wir haben viele Ideen, die mit ShiftYard oder in neuen Konstellationen umgesetzt werden können. Wir sind bereits jetzt auch über die Grenzen Österreichs hinaus tätig und wollen uns geografisch auch nicht beschränken. Was das Leistungsangebot angeht, muss man immer ein gutes Gleichgewicht finden zwischen Weiterentwicklung und Fokussierung. Viel wird derzeit in Österreich über Start Ups geredet. Kaum ein Tag vergeht ohne einer neuen Initiative. Wie siehst Du Österreich als Start Up Land? Es gibt mittlerweile eine sehr positive Stimmung und breite Unterstützung für Gründerinnen, Gründer und Start-ups. Jetzt gilt es einerseits kritisch weitere Verbesserungen einzufordern und gleichzeitig nicht ins Jammern zu verfallen. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? Abgesehen von der politischen Unterstützung und dem Bürokratieabbau sollte weiter am Thema Entrepreneurship Education gearbeitet werden. Gründen muss eine echte Karrierealternative sein – aber auch das Handwerkszeug dazu muss vermittelt werden. Menschen wie Johannes Lindner (u.a. auch Ashoka fellow) arbeiten da bereits sehr erfolgreich daran. Hast Du einen Tipp unsere LeserInnen? Innovators are made, not born! Innovation kann man lernen und es gibt unendlich viele Ressourcen, die man da anzapfen kann. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Innovation heißt auch Zukunft gestalten. Gesellschaftlich würde ich mir wünschen, dass wir an einer Zukunft arbeiten, in der das Miteinander und die Zusammenarbeit im Vordergrund steht, zwischen Menschen, Kulturen, Ländern, Branchen, Mitbewerbern, Kunden, Lieferanten, ….

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/12/06/a-conversation-with-veronika-fiegl/","ImpactHub","Becoming stronger through fear – a conversation with Veronika Fiegl"," I walk into the Chill Out Room at Impact Hub trying really hard not to show that I had just sprinted from Zieglergasse to be on time. Veronika Fiegl is not one to waste time – she offers some water and tells me to take off my shoes and socks and sit on the massage table set in the middle of the room, feet facing her. My session was booked spontaneously: Veronika visits Impact Hub every two months for special free one to one sessions available exclusively to the Impact Hub community members. It just happened that her last one collided with my search for an inspiring Impact Hub member to interview (which she totally is). Veronika immediately started rubbing my feet to discover pressure points indicating where my body is tense. The idea is that since we stand on our feet all day, they are the best tellers of how our body behaves under different circumstances. She correctly diagnosed my chronic neck and back problem, as well as served an awesome side dish of psychoanalysis, which left me stupefied. When I asked her how did she know, she simply responded “It is all here. You are carrying all the stress and the issue, which had caused it, around with you”. Meet Veronika Fiegl, the Grinberg Method practitioner Let’s start with an introduction. What do you do? I practice the Grinberg Method in different forms: as individual and group sessions. You have been self-employed for the last 15 years successfully treating people through touch. How did you come across the Grinberg Method? I found a gift voucher in Billa which said ‘free foot analysis’ (laughs). I had no idea what it was, actually I thought it is something cosmetics related, which I don’t care about. At first I didn’t take the gift voucher. I walked out of Billa and then I had a sort of a shock going through me: ‘I need this gift voucher!’. I ran back, took it, looked at it for the next three weeks. In the end I finally went to have that foot analysis and it was the first time I had the impression that somebody really sees me. Somebody is not fooled by my pretense and does not buy my theater, sort of. I felt that somebody really sees my issues. That was fascinating. When did you become a practitioner yourself? I was just a client for a year and I didn’t ever think about it. Then my sister thought she would become a practitioner and I had to gather all the information for her. While I was doing that, I started to become curious, to understand that this is not a massage, but something very empowering. This method really believes in us being fundamentally intelligent creatures. We have all the talents we need to thrive, to do in life what we want. If you are confident, if you trust yourself, you know what to do. What in your own words is the core value, the key message of the Grinberg Method? The idea of the Grinberg Method is that by learning to feel your body again, you rediscover your talents. You become who you actually are and then you sit well in your life and have much fewer problems. We look at what is somebody’s potential, which you can see in the body, and then how that somebody is actually using their potential. There can be a big difference between who they could be and who they actually made themselves to be at the moment. For example some people could naturally be extremely outgoing but for some reason they learned to be shy in their life. Experiencing life through the body… That sounds as if the method was taking us away from the focus on the mind, which right now prevails. When it comes to physicality, we often only talk about general fitness – the body is maintained like a well-oiled machine to prevent failure in the crucial moments. My question is: where does the Grinberg Method fit? I would say what the Grinberg Method calls being a body is a very different perception to what you just described. You basically described what the society thinks: we are all thinking heads and then we have this machine that should be pretty, slim and work. Grinberg Method says that thinking is also a part of your body, you cannot think without your body. The idea of the Grinberg Method is not to be physical without the mind- the idea is to balance it. Being a body means that you have all of your abilities available to you and not one part of you is more important than the rest. Imagine that you are in a severe pain – you cannot think straight because you are in pain, right? However, if you are very relaxed, your head is clear, your thoughts can flow. This exact gap between what we call our mind and the rest of our body, became almost a war zone in our society. So one of the elements of the Grinberg Method, ‘taking the focus away from the mind’, does not actually mean prioritizing the body? I wouldn’t say it’s being physical against the mind, not at all. It’s teaching you to be you from head to toe, with the aim of finding maximum balance to have the life that you want without screwing that up with tensions, with low confidence, with judging yourself, doubting yourself. We look at all the places where people really make their own life difficult: from simply not breathing deep enough to judging yourself and doubting yourself, giving yourself commands, pushing yourself. This is how we stab ourselves in the back. We, the Grinberg Method practitioners, say ‘Feel what you do to yourself’. Feel yourself, be aware of yourself. For example if you constantly judge yourself, you feel that it is nasty, it’s horrible, it’s actually painful. If you are aware of yourself, if you feel that it is painful, then you can decide if you really want to do this. What you are describing, being confronted with a situation we learned to be stressed about and start taking short breaths or tense up, sounds like a bad habit. Is there a pattern for these bad physical habits to form? Is there a reason that one person develops a habit of bad posture when overwhelmed and another won’t? I would say it is personal but we also live in a culture. There are always other people around you, so there are cultural patterns. Most of us sit a lot, we control our neck and shoulders a lot, there is a cultural tendency It doesn’t mean that everybody has to react certain way. We have personal choice in deciding if my breathing will be shallow or not. You can continue to breathe even if everybody else is gasping. In the end it is individual how you react and we can change it. Would you say that practicing the Grinberg Method yourself has changed you? If you look at the photographs of me when I was sixteen I looked twice as old as I look now, because I was much more tense, worried, serious. I was trying to show that I am somebody else. Now, when something bad happens, I have much more confidence that I can deal with it. I waste less energy on tensing up and worrying. It means I actually have more energy free to think of an actual solution. In the past I was a good pupil, I worked very hard and I pushed myself to achieve what I thought was important for me. At the end I was exhausted; I was tired, my back was hurting and I didn’t trust my own abilities at all. Now it is completely different. I have a life that I chose and if I don’t like something in my life, I know that I can change it. You just mentioned that you were doubting yourself. At Impact Hub we talk a lot about anxiety, fear of failure, stress. How our body learning bad physical habits in reaction to negative situations translate into self-doubt? I think doubting ourselves is a bad habit that we learn from other people too. I know for sure I learned it from my family. Because we not only learn postures from other people, we learn feelings, we learn how to think. We don’t allow ourselves to be who we are. We constantly have to keep ourselves in check, say the right thing, perform. There is so much energy stuck in these rules of who you can and cannot be.It’s like a plant which has been cut too much. You weaken it. How long have been going to Impact Hub to give Grinberg Method sessions? I think it’s either 2 or 3 years… In that time you must have seen enough community members to know what are the most common issues they are facing. What is the struggle that most people face? All Hubbers whom I have met were people that had a purpose, a vision, a dream, who want something in life. What I have seen many times is that they put themselves under pressure because they want something badly. It’s like their business was their baby, and I completely understand because my business is my baby, and because of that they suffer from a specific type of self-inflicted pressure. They feel that they have to succeed, not like in the corporate world of trying to make your boss happy, but on a more personal level. Being afraid of failing is another thing. They are not relaxing with this fear, because unless we train it, nobody tells us to try that. I know a lot of people who do not take enough breaks, don’t relax enough, who don’t stop thinking about their job at all. People who either exploit or run in the danger of exploiting themselves. Along with this fear is the worry about money. Money is a big issue for a lot of Hubbers I have met. The important part of your observations is fear: of failure, of not being enough, of not having enough money. The Grinberg Method states that fear is an important part of our lives because it can be turned around and used to propel our goals instead of damaging us. So how do I do that? This is something you really need to learn through your body. The theory is really easy- basically ‘Be afraid and then relax’. That’s it. Breathe, relax, allow the fear. But this is exactly something that you need to learn as an experience through the body, because usually we learn as a physical habit to block fear, to not want fear. It is a bit like having a constipation of fear. Learning to let if flow again is something that we can learn best from body to body. That fear is not always irrational because for us, self-employed people, money is an issue and the fear that maybe the business will not go so well, comes from the fact that you simply just don’t know. I had so many ups and downs of my business, sometimes I had more money that I knew how to spend, and sometimes I had just about enough money. In this sense I would say it is not irrational to be afraid as a self-employed person. You will be afraid, constantly. But, the way this fear feels for you – this can change dramatically. For me in the past it was panic. Now, I don’t experience it like this anymore, because I relax into it and it actually becomes just energy waking me up. It doesn’t feel like it used to feel because I don’t block it anymore. The interesting thing is that when you really stop fighting it, it is not the monster that you thought it once was. But what happens when somebody, a business person like our Impact Hub members, is blocking the fear constantly? It means they lose money because they are wasting energy in themselves. I always tell my clients when I find very tense places in their bodies that this point is almost like a bank account that you forgot about. You invest energy into closing this area of your body. Doing this makes you more tired, it makes you older, it makes you less inventive, less creative. As a business person these are qualities you need: you need your brain, you need to be able to think, to see opportunities, to dare, to act. If you stand around shy and wait hoping somebody will find you, it gets hard. I really think being panicked, worry is too expensive for us business people. We cannot afford it. As a finish line, I wanted to ask you if you have a simple method for people who will read this interview, which they could apply every day to de-stress themselves. Most of us work in front of the computer a lot, so there is one exercise that I would suggest, not only to do once per day but often, during breaks. Before you start working, take a few really, really deep breaths. Feel how you sit on the chair, allow your weight to sink into the chair. Feel the feet on the floor. Then, if you want to, close your eyes, and for a few minutes just breath and feel that you exist as a body. Breathe and pay attention to your body. Be aware and enter the situation with all of your body. Some of my clients have a pop up in their calendar that says ‘breathe’ or set an alarm to remind themselves to spend a few minutes feeling their body. I recommend that too. Thank you for your time, Veronika!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/becoming-stronger-through-fear-a-conversation-with-veronika-fiegl-cover-photo1-600x400.png","December 6, 2016","en",0.994188189506531,0.15506404034871,0.506374165415764,0.0928250461195906,0.245736723144849
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/12/08/rita-huber-interview/","ImpactHub","Rita Huber: “Meine Leidenschaften sind Kochen, Essen und Lachen, also das, was ich immer und überall von Herzen gerne tue.”","Rita Huber kommt aus dem wunderschönen Salzburger Land. Sie hat Filmwissenschaft und Komparatistik in Wien studiert. Nach dem Studium ging es für Rita einmal in den Kunst- und Kulturbereich. Zu den Tätigkeiten zählten unter anderem Produktionsleitung für Kino unter Sternen am Karlsplatz, Assistenz Pressebüro Salzburger Festspiele, Produktionen für FM4, Ö1, Mischief Films, u.v.m. Und dann ist die Idee aufgekommen einen vegetarischen Lieferservice aufzuziehen. Und im Februar 2014 war es dann soweit. Gemeinsam mit Gerald Költringer wurde Rita bringt´s gegründet und schon im April wurden die ersten Kunden mit vegetarischem BIO Essen verwöhnt. Die Auslieferung erfolgt vom ersten Tag an mit dem Lastenrad. Wie würdest Du Dich beschreiben und was versteckt sich hinter Rita bringt´s? Am zufriedensten bin ich, wenn ich gut gegessen habe. Meistens bin ich also sehr zufrieden. Und wenn dem nicht so ist, bin ich optimistisch genug, um mich immer noch glücklich zu schätzen. Was ich gar nicht mag, sind pessimistisch denkende Menschen und „Owizahra“ und wenn mir jemand vorsätzlich ins Gesicht lügt. Außerdem mag ich Kühe und ihre Umgebung – Wiesen, Alm und Berge. Ich bin fürchterlich emotional, mich kann ein positives oder negatives Wort meines Gegenübers genauso schnell zu Tränen rühren wie ein guter Gedanke, eine schöne Erinnerung oder ein guter Film. Rita bringt’s ist Wiens erster Lieferservice für vegetarisches BIO Mittagessen, per Lastenrad geliefert. Wir haben ein von der Vorbestellung der Speisen über ihre Zubereitung und Auslieferung, bis hin zu den biologisch abbaubaren Verpackungen nachhaltiges Konzept aufgebaut, bei dem es uns zudem wichtig ist, dass auch unsere derzeit 23 Mitarbeiter/innen fair angestellt und entlohnt werden. Wir kochen mit besten BIO Zutaten und arbeiten vor allem mit Wertschätzung für das, was wir tun. Was treibt Dich an? Ein schier unendlicher Tatendrang, manche nennen es Rastlosigkeit. Die Lust, wirklich viel zu arbeiten und damit etwas zu bewegen. Die Liebe zu dem, was ich tue und damit ändern kann und nicht zuletzt der Wille, von einem nachhaltig arbeitenden Unternehmenskonzept leben zu können. Welche Bedeutung hat gesunde Ernährung für Dich? Gesunde Ernährung hat einen sehr hohen Stellenwert in meinem Leben, schon seit dem Kindesalter. Ich wurde von meiner Mutter dahingehend geprägt – sie hat mir bis zu meiner Matura täglich eine gesunde Jause für die Schule vorbereitet (teilweise sogar eigepackt oder bis zur Haustür nachgetragen), wenn ich wieder nachhause gekommen bin, hat auf mich jeden Tag ein frisch gekochtes Essen gewartet. Da gab’s kein Cola, keine Chips und kein fettiges Essen und mir hat wirklich nix gefehlt. Wertvolle Zutaten und eine gesunde Zubereitung waren selbstverständlich. Dass das nicht selbstverständlich ist, habe ich erst in meiner Zeit als Studentin in Wien gelernt, aber versuche seit dem Tag die von zuhause gewohnte Qualität beizubehalten. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Lebensmittel in deinem Leben ein? Ich beschäftige mich nicht nur beruflich, sondern auch privat am liebsten damit. Egal, ob es um Land- und Viehwirtschaft, Einkauf, Herkunft, Geschichte oder ihre Verarbeitung in der Küche dreht, Lebensmittel interessieren mich brennend, im ernährungstheoretischen, chemischen, gesellschaftlichen, philosophischen oder kulturellen Sinne. Bei rita bringt´s versuchst du ja in allen Bereichen einen neuen und vor allem sehr nachhaltigen Weg zu gehen. Warum in dieser Ganzheitlichkeit? Weil es logisch ist. Weil wir ein Konzept in die Welt setzen wollten, bei dem ein sinnvoller Gedanke den nächsten ergibt. Weil wir uns für nichts rechtfertigen müssen und auch niemanden anlügen müssen, wenn wir erklären, was wir tun. Weil wir eine Marke aufbauen wollten, der man bedingungslos vertrauen kann. Weil wir Meilensteine setzen wollen und weil ich vor allem mit meiner Persönlichkeit und meinen Werten, nicht zuletzt mit meinem Namen dafür einstehe. Warum vegetarisch? Warum bio? Vegetarisch, weil ich mich seit ca. 15 Jahren vegetarisch ernähre. Ich habe vom Elternhaus einen sehr bodenständigen Bezug zu Viehhaltung und Landwirtschaft mitbekommen, gelernt, was woher kommt und warum. Meine Entscheidung, fleischlos zu leben, kam nach und nach, weniger aus ethischen Gründen, aber vielmehr aus geschmacklichen, ich wollte einfach kein Fleisch mehr essen, mir hat davor gegraut. Für mich bedeutet eine vegetarische ausgewogene Ernährung ein gesundes Leben (ich war seit meinem 12. Lebensjahr nicht mehr krank), vegetarisch oder vegan bezieht sich außerdem nicht mehr nur auf unser Essen, sondern für mich auch auf eine Lebenseinstellung, eine bedachte Haltung gegenüber Mensch und Tier und allem Leben. BIO, weil es einfach die schonendere und gesündere Anbauweise für Boden und Mensch ist. 100% BIO, weil wir eine Marke sein wollen, der man ohne Kompromiss und Sternderl vertrauen kann. Wir sind der Meinung, dass unser Essen damit gerade für jene, die täglich viele Stunden im Büro verbringen, eine gute Entscheidung ist, um danach mit neuer Energie weiterzuarbeiten. Hat es für „Rita bringt´s“ einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Die Initiative kam im Februar 2014 von meinem Schwager Gerald, der bei einer Recherche festgestellt hat, dass es so ein ganzheitliches Angebot in Wien noch nicht gab. Wir haben schon mal zusammengearbeitet, haben eine sehr ähnliche Arbeitsmoral und er wusste von mir, dass ich in meinem damaligen Arbeitsumfeld nicht sonderlich zufrieden war. Er hat mich gefragt, ob wir so etwas gemeinsam machen wollen und hat damit offenbar bei mir einen roten Schalter umgelegt – ich wollte sofort und für uns waren rasch die Grundprinzipien klar. Innerhalb von zwei Monaten haben wir alles aufgebaut, der 1. April 2014 ist der Geburtstag von RITA bringt’s, an dem wir quasi von einem auf den anderen Tag für 40 Personen gekocht und geliefert haben. Wo siehst Du dich in den nächsten Jahren? Kurzfristig wollen wir gerade alles verbessern, was wir uns in sehr kurzer Zeit angefangen haben. Prozesse optimieren, Abläufe verkürzen, Strukturen stabilisieren. Damit denken wir dann längerfristig an ein Franchise Konzept im deutschsprachigen Raum und darüber hinaus. In welches Spezialgebiet es mich damit treibt, ist für mich noch unklar, uns stehen wirklich viele Herausforderungen bevor, auf die ich mich freue. In den nächsten Jahren – die Frage ist sehr weit gegriffen. Ich bin noch keine 30, aber in den nächsten vielen Jahren sehe ich mich zumindest nicht mehr in der Stadt, sondern am Land, mit mehr Platz, mehr Luft, mehr Wiese, mehr Berg. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Ich mag die (anfänglichen) Hürden von Jungunternehmer/innen gar nicht auf konkrete Beispiele beziehen, viel mehr auf andauernde Prozesse. Für mich persönlich geht es kontinuierlich um konsequente Selbstorganisation. Wenn man das gut im Griff hat, arbeitet es sich leichter – egal in welchen Bereichen des täglichen oder nicht alltäglichen Arbeitens ist das für mich sehr oft eine Herausforderung. Ein Führungsstil, mit dem man selbst gut zurande kommt, ist wichtig, den erlernt man auch erst im Umgang mit Mitarbeiter/innen und mit sich selbst – ich zumindest. Bei jedem Rückschlag braucht es nicht nur Halt vom persönlichen Umfeld, sondern vor allem genug Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstmotivation, um doch nicht liegen zu bleiben, sondern wieder vom Boden aufzustehen und weiterzumachen, egal wie müde, demotiviert, enttäuscht, geknickt man ist. Am Ende (und auch am Anfang) geht es natürlich auch um den finanziellen Aspekt. Wir sind kein „klassisches“ Startup, das einen Raketenstart hinlegt, einen Haufen Gewinn macht und innerhalb von zwei Jahren verkauft. Wir sind ein nachhaltig arbeitendes junges Unternehmen, das bedeutet auch, dass wir unsere Arbeitsplätze auch in 10 Jahren noch anbieten wollen. Wir werden damit nie reich werden, vor allem dauert es länger, bis wir überhaupt davon leben können. Das braucht einen langen Atem und die Bereitschaft auf Vieles zu verzichten. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja sehr. Mich interessiert prinzipiell alles. Ich habe auch überlegt, zum Beispiel Physik zu studieren, weil mich die Materie unendlich fasziniert – habe dann aber festgestellt, dass mir dafür in der Tiefe das Vorwissen und die nötige Denkweise fehlt. Ich hinterfrage gerne alles, womit ich zu tun habe, wenn ich das auch nicht laut mache, sondern einfach oft lange über etwas nachdenke, um mir danach eine Meinung zu bilden oder mich weiter zu informieren. Ich bin mit einer Information nicht zufrieden, solange ich sie nicht verstehe – dann merke ich es mir auch nicht. Ich bin an Fakten interessiert und am „Wesen“ der Dinge, an einer intelligenten, kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit unserer Welt und unserem Leben. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? Oh, das ist eine zu große Frage. Ich versuche sie ansatzweise zu beantworten: Glück bedeutet für mich im Großen, dass ich wertschätze und hochhalte, wo ich herkomme, in welches Land, in welche Familie, in welche Zeit, in welches soziale Umfeld ich hineingeboren wurde. Dass ich Verstand und Intellekt habe und gesund bin, nicht zuletzt, dass ich emotional bin. Auf diesen wirklich glücklichen Gegebenheiten, zu denen ich selbst so gar nichts beitragen konnte, baue ich auf und bin nun fähig, seit ich selbst entscheiden kann, etwas dafür zu leisten, um diese zu erhalten.Dann gibt es glückliche Momente. An diesen sind für mich meist auch andere beteiligt, denn Glück ist doch am Schönsten, wenn man es teilen kann. Und da zählen für mich die kleinen Dinge: Herzliches Lachen, die ersten Frühlingsblumen, körperlicher Kontakt, das Verhalten junger Tiere und kleiner Kinder, Sonne im Gesicht, der Moment, wenn man ein Geschenk übergibt, nicht zuletzt richtig gutes Essen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Der Welt? Die meisten Milliarden Menschen dieser Erde wissen gar nicht von uns, insofern nichts. Ein paar Tausende hätten aber ein Gesprächsthema weniger, einige Hunderte würden täglich oder immer wieder mal nur Zeug statt gutem Essen zu sich nehmen. Und etwas mehr als zwei Dutzend hätten einen anderen oder keinen Job. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Meine Leidenschaften sind Kochen, Essen und Lachen, also das, was ich immer und überall von Herzen gerne tue. Dafür muss ich dankenswerterweise auf nichts verzichten. Wenn es darum gehen soll, dass ich meine Leidenschaft zum Beruf gemacht hätte, dann muss ich sagen, dass meine Arbeit und mein Unternehmen nicht meine Leidenschaft, sondern mein Leben geworden sind. Dazu gehört, dass man das, was man am Liebsten tut, im Alltag für das Unternehmen nicht mehr macht, in meinem Fall kochen. Würde ich mich nur darauf konzentrieren, gäbe es keinen Fortschritt, deshalb, um die Frage zu beantworten: ich verzichte aufs Kochen, um das Unternehmen weiterzubringen, aber hole das oft zuhause nach oder dann, wenn ich ganz allein in der ganz großen Küche bin, den Kopf frei habe oder frei bekommen möchte und um mal still zu sein. Viel wird derzeit in Österreich über Start Ups geredet. Kaum ein Tag vergeht ohne einer neuen Initiative. Wie siehst Du Österreich als Start Up Land? Unser Konzept funktioniert in Österreich und vor allem in Wien sehr gut. Als junges Unternehmen und Gründer standen wir natürlich vor einigen bürokratischen und finanziellen Hürden, die es zu überwinden galt, einiges war ärgerlich und einige Umstände auch vermeidbar. Wir haben ziemlich viel Leer- und Lehrgeld bezahlt, weil an manchen Ecken einfach die Beratung gefehlt hat – aber meist auch nur deshalb, weil’s sonst auch niemand besser gewusst hat als wir. Man muss dazu sagen, dass von der Idee bis zur Umsetzung bei uns tatsächlich nur zwei Monate vergangen sind, da war keine Zeit für lange Wege oder viel Herumüberlegen, wir haben’s einfach gemacht. Recht schmerzlich war dann die Erkenntnis, dass wir durch manche Förderprogramme gefallen sind, weil diese nur dann greifen, wenn das Projekt in Planung ist und nicht bereits in der Umsetzung. Darauf bezogen bleibt zu sagen – man möchte als junges Unternehmen von Stadt, Land, Politik und Wirtschaft zu jedem Zeitpunkt unterstützt werden, man sucht da keine Almosen, sondern hat eh schon einen Haufen Mut aufgebracht, um das überhaupt durchzuziehen, da braucht man wirklich keine schiefen Ansagen oder schwindlige Begründungen. Aber dann, wenn man mal erfolgreich ist, klopfen einem alle auf die Schultern und der Wirtschaftsstandort rühmt sich, so viele Arbeitsplätze geschaffen zu haben. Na, wer hat die denn geschaffen, die Wirtschaftskammer vielleicht? Ich glaube, das waren und sind dann doch die (jungen) Unternehmen. Da kann ich nur ganz radikal fordern: runter mit den Lohnnebenkosten, die brechen einem das Genick, vor allem, wenn man faire Arbeitsverhältnisse anbieten will. Naja, wir sind nur teilweise ein Startup, denn die „Definition“ schließt meist auch ein, dass man das Unternehmen nach zwei oder drei Jahren gewinnbringend verkauft. Das ist bei uns wahrlich nicht der Fall, wir denken das Unternehmen weiter, wir stecken so tief in der Materie, es hat so viel Potential, um noch unendlich viele Ideen weiterzuentwickeln – da denken wir nicht an was Neues, Anderes, viel wichtiger ist uns ein nachhaltiges Arbeiten auf allen Ebenen und das ist bei vielen Startups einfach nicht der Fall, weil sie kurzlebig sind und das Konzept auch nicht nachhaltig angesetzt ist. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? Wie schon zuvor erwähnt. Daran anknüpfend – die Erleichterung für Startups, die im Frühjahr dieses Jahres vorgestellt wurden, sind fein, aber warum gelten sie nicht für alle Neugründungen? Sie beziehen sich vorwiegend auf die Tech- und IT Szene, deren Natur es ist, schnell, innovativ und meist auch ohne viel Personalaufwand zu arbeiten. Warum fallen Gastro Startups, Kulturinitiativen, soziale Unternehmen nicht darunter? Weil sie einfach länger und mehr „Pflege“ brauchen um zu wachsen und die Gewinne nicht (sofort) so hoch sind. Ich sag nur BIO Gemüse, da ist’s ähnlich. Schmecken tut’s besser, gesünder ist’s auch – und zwar nicht nur für den menschlichen Körper, sondern für die gesamte Umwelt. Es braucht halt mehr Zuneigung. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Wenn man Entrepreneurship in seiner Definition versteht, dass man den Willen und die Kraft aufbringt, Dinge auf die Beine zu stellen, Ideen zu verwirklichen und etwas zum Laufen zu bringen, mit dem Ziel, damit Geld zu verdienen, egal, welche Risiken einen erwarten – dann ist dass mein tägliches Thema. Wir arbeiten seit nunmehr zweieinhalb Jahren daran, mit einem nachhaltigen Unternehmen Geld zu verdienen, nein, von unserem nachhaltigen Unternehmen zu leben. Das ist bei den sich fast täglich ändernden Einkaufspreisen für Lebensmittel, den niedrigen Margen in der (BIO) Gastronomie, der eher geringen Kaufbereitschaft und den teilweise unberechenbaren Problematiken des Tagesgeschäfts eine größere Herausforderung, als sie bei erster Betrachtung klingen mag. Derzeit leben unsere Mitarbeiter/innen davon. Zugegeben, wir sind ziemlich naiv in die Materie quer-eingestiegen. Aber, und hier komme ich auf die Frage zurück, wir sind realistisch, wir träumen nicht. Wir glauben fest daran, dass das, was wir gepflanzt haben, guten Ertrag bringen wird, wir sprechen nicht von Überfluss. Und wenn ich von Glauben spreche, dann halte ich’s gern mit Anselm Grün: Selbstvertrauen ist göttlich. Wir glauben also an uns selbst, vertrauen auf unsere Fähigkeiten, Stärken und unseren Elan, daran, dass wir das Kind schaukeln können, egal was kommt. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Gemüse. Ich wollte die Antwort eigentlich so stehen lassen, aber ich muss sie doch noch ein bisschen erläutern. Die Arbeit in der Küche ist die Unmittelbarste, die ich je erlebt habe: man hat ein Lebensmittel, das über lange Zeit gediehen ist und geerntet wurde. Das ist das erste Ergebnis der Landwirtschaft, das zu uns kommt. Jetzt kann ich mit meinen eigenen Händen und mit einer Portion Kreativität herbeiführen, dass etwas Besonderes daraus wird. Ich schicke das per Lastenrad und Muskelkraft zu unseren Kund/innen und kann Vieles bewirken: Hunger stillen, Freude hervorrufen (unter anderem auch, weil ich behaupte, dass die Unseren die schönsten FahrradbotInnen sind…) Glücksgefühle sind oft beim Genuss dabei und unser Essen fördert die Gesundheit und damit auch das Wohlbefinden. Die Speise ist verzehrt und in vielen Fällen bekomme ich rasch Rückmeldung. Das ist ein Arbeitsprozess, der innerhalb weniger Stunden abgeschlossen ist und ein (meist) zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis bringt. Das wollen wir doch alle, oder? Das klingt jetzt ziemlich romantisch. Um das abzuschwächen: Küchenarbeit ist verdammt hart. Es ist brütend heiß (ich zähle 12 Brandnarben auf meinen Unterarmen), man ist ständig auf den Beinen, es muss immer schnell gehen, man schleppt, hievt, beansprucht jeden einzelnen Muskel und kleinste Fehler werden nicht verziehen. Man muss geistig und körperlich ein Viech sein, um in einer Küche (jeder Größe) arbeiten zu können. Aber, um auf’s Gemüse zurückzukommen: ich beschäftige mich damit täglich, stündlich, jeden Moment. Egal, ob ich es selbst am Balkon anzubauen versuche, alte und neue Sorten entdecke, die Zutaten einkaufe, neue Kreationen ausprobiere, darüber schreibe, daran rieche, den Biomüll entsorge, die Speisen esse. Gemüse, Früchte, unsere Lebensmittel, die sind das Schönste. Wer ist Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Meine großartigen Eltern, die mir Vieles ermöglicht haben. Mein Vater, den ich gern hervorhebe, obwohl wir im Alltag wenig voneinander hören, aber er hat mich mit seiner Lebensweise und Einstellung zur Arbeit sehr geprägt und jedes Mal, wenn wir uns sehen und miteinander reden, ziehe ich neue Energie aus seinen Worten und vor allem seinen Fragen – die stellt mir sonst einfach niemand und sie zwingen mich im positiven Sinne zum Nachdenken, Umdenken und Verändern. Meine lieben Schwestern, die auf alle Fragen Antworten wissen, weil sie das Meiste selbst schon erlebt haben und mir so ähnlich, wenn auch so anders sind. Meine Freunde, die ich mittlerweile an einer Hand abzählen kann, wirklich selten sehe, aber denen ich emotional und rational verbunden bin. Mein Freund, der mich ins Bett bringt, wenn ich schon wieder am Tisch eingeschlafen bin, der mich trotz seines eigenen übersprudelnden Charakters beruhigen kann und der prinzipiell alles gut findet, was ich tue, mit dem leisen Hinweis, etwas noch besser zu machen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Letzterer. Manchmal auch der Wein. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Geheim nicht. Aber viele Ideen. Ich weiß es nicht, um ehrlich zu sein, momentan ist noch Vieles offen und ungewiss, das stört mich aber nicht. Es gibt viele Dinge, die ich gern machen möchte, die mit Gastro, BIO Lebensmitteln, nachhaltigem Leben, aber auch Kunst zu tun haben – ich bin auf manches Talent und viel Eifer aufmerksam geworden, das möchte ich gern vertiefen oder überhaupt ausprobieren. Erfolg spielt auch eine Rolle, Vieles habe ich erreicht, was ich mir nie erträumt hätte, aber mindestens 90% habe ich noch vor mir, weil ich meist unzufrieden mit dem Ergebnis bin, das bedeutet, dass ich’s immer besser machen möchte, was ich als positiv empfinde. Wenn ich nichts mehr zu arbeiten habe, dann sterbe ich, das ist klar. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Also das weiß ich wirklich nicht, das ist mir sogar ein Rätsel, wie das so oft schon funktionieren konnte. Ich glaube, ich habe viele Lachfalten, die vielleicht Freude hervorrufen… Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Soweit ich das weiß, befürworten alle die Initiative und das Ergebnis. Dass das manchmal mehr als Engagement, nämlich Überforderung und Überlastung bedeutet, ist nicht immer förderlich. Dann betone ich aber, dass ich noch immer gut schlafe und immer lachen kann, dann verstehen’s die meisten. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Einfach machen. Hast Du einen Wunsch?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/05/6-reasons-why-co-working-is-good-for-you-and-your-business/","ImpactHub","6 reasons why co-working is good for you – and your business","For a while now ‘co-working’ has been a buzzword, but have you taken the time to think about how it can really benefit you? With so many people starting their own business or working on an innovative start up, co-working really will give you the edge you need. Here are six good reasons why… 1. Community Co-working allows you to be surrounded by others just like you, who want to be part of a community. No longer do you have to be isolated at home, you can have ‘colleagues’ without having colleagues. These people can become a sounding board and support system for you, offering advice or opinions when you need it – something that is missing when you work alone. Plus, it gives you some cool people to have lunch with. 2. Collaboration Often times co-working spaces (like Impact Hub Vienna) are incubators for new ventures and start-ups, and a haven for people who are experts in their field. Being a part of this means you have unlimited opportunities to collaborate with others on innovative projects and possibly even snag some new clients. If nothing else, having access to these experts will allow you to seek advice on your own work, saving you time and money. 3. Know what’s going on A co-working community has the pulse of the city and knows what is happening when and where. If you are trying to break into the start up scene or are new to a city, it is likely that your co-working space will be invaluable to you. Talk to other members and ask around about what is happening and what you can be a part of. 4. Inspiration & Creativity Take a peek through the doors of any co-working space and you will often see some of the most talented and creative people the city has to offer. Designers, innovators, storytellers, digital experts – people who join co-working spaces because they want to think (and work) outside the box to create something new. This creativity is infectious and can only have a positive effect on you and your work. Take some time to look at the projects of other members and be inspired. Seeing what is possible can help you break through any blocks you have in your own work. 5. Knowledge In addition to networking and having access to expert members, co-working spaces are often the venue for workshops and training seminars. Sometimes these are formal (the accelerate program) while other times they are simply members helping members (Hubbers helping Hubbers). As a member you get the inside scoop on what events are coming up. 6. Work-life balance While working from home may seem ideal, it is not always the dream that it is portrayed to be. There are a million distractions (hello Netflix!) that can take you off topic at any time of the day. Unless you are super motivated and disciplined, home may not be the most productive place to work. So get out of your house (and your pyjamas) and into Impact Hub!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/11/dont-tell-you-mother-but-messy-is-awesome/","ImpactHub","Don’t tell your mother … but Messy is awesome!","David Bowie, a travelling mathematician, the famous Building 20 at MIT, and the most human human are all at home in this exploration of creativity, adaptability, and resilience. As New Year’s has only come and gone very recently, the lists that everyone makes with the best of intentions to improve themselves and daily life are still fresh. Everyone vows to lose the Christmas weight, the five kilograms from last year, to read more, become more active, eat better, quit all the bad habits, drink less (caffeinated beverages and alcohol), and get more organized. Well, Tim Harford, the author of Messy, would like to talk you out of that last one. And if Benjamin Franklin were alive, he would probably tell you about how unsuccessful he was at being organized. Tim Harford is the author of several really amazing books, The Undercover Economist, The Undercover Economist Strikes Back, Adapt, and The Logic of Life. He also writes a regular column for the Financial Times and is a radio commentator on BBC Radio 4 and hosts the program More or Less. The Wizard, the mathematician, and the dilapidated building Creativity seems elusive and transient; a trait that is possessed by a few mad geniuses who are elevated above the rest. Harford shares the in-depth experiences of some of the most widely recognized creative thinkers from across various industries. From the production of David Bowie’s Lodger album, to the immense and generous intellect of mathematician Paul Erdos, and the stories from the intellectual giants in MIT’s legendary Building 20, through honest analysis of their experiences Harford provides his readers with valuable insights into the creative process. Cover art – Lodger by David Bowie, EMI RecordsHarford sets a bleak scene for his readers, Bowie had come to the end of his creative rope. His marriage was failing and he was experiencing legal troubles. He was a mess. Enter the wizard with some weird advice. That is not Brian Eno’s nickname, but Hatford informs his readers that he “once dressed like a wizard”. Eno created a deck of cards that he referred to as “oblique strategies”. He would draw a card and people acted on the instructions. The twist here is that the directions were apropos of nothing, “twist the spine”, “water”, and “change instrument roles” are just a few examples. Paul Erdos was a mathematician best known as “the most prolific collaborator in the history of science”. The picture Harford paints for his readers is of an itinerate, amphetamine addicted genius with a vast number of acquaintances. He did not own a home – preferring instead to stay as an incredibly demanding houseguest with other mathematicians. However, “he made connections no one else could” and this often meant breakthroughs across the disciplines of mathematics as he shared information across fields. Not Building 20 – just the main campus building for MITMIT’s Building 20 was a complete disaster at the time of its destruction. It had housed everything from offices to a radiation lab to anechoic chambers. Noam Chomsky, Bose, hacker culture, and arcade games were all borne in this building. Administrators did not care about the building, it was always meant to be demolished, one project even removed several floors to ensure that their project would fit inside. That was the world’s first marketable atomic clock. Amongst the various stories of disorganization, adverse conditions, and absolute chaos that are the crucibles of creativity and innovation are stories of people. Actual people, like the man who won the Loebner Prize for the “Most Human Human” at the annual Turing Test in 2009. It is an astounding story of robots, interrupted conversations, and hacking OkCupid. You will have to read it to find out the rest. Lessons Learned © Jazmin Quaynor (Unsplash.com)What Hartford ultimately concludes is that we need to be open to possibility, no matter how messy. “We’ve seen, again and again, that creativity, excitement, and humanity lie in the messy parts of life, not the tidy ones”, and that includes how much you get accomplished with respect to email, whether or not you actually use documents, or whether your room is just fine (and not a complete pig sty – like your mother was always fond of saying). Harford manages to blend hard scientific research and solid historical fact with an amusing flair. The book itself is roughly broken into broad themes with stories that intertwine and interrupt each other, much like the course of a conversation. Harford will convince you to embrace the inherent “messiness” of life and cross that resolution off your New Year’s list.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Blog-Image-Guide-messy-600x400.jpg","January 11, 2017","en",0.993795216083527,0.00048255902947858,0.525884300470352,0.00321232608985156,0.470420837402344

Know yourself A resolution is a habit in the making, albeit a very delicate one since the majority of the new year resolutions fail miserable. Hence I propose approaching the whole thing methodically like a real strategist would. Meaning, doing your research i.e. getting to know yourself first to know what habits are going to work for you and which you should forget. I have already written on the Impact Hub blog about types of habit personalities developed by Gretchen Rubin so have a look and put your finger on the kind of character you have. Make 2017 your year of discovery – find out what motivates you, what dampens your energy, what scares you and what drives you forward. 2. Take time off from hustling *at this stage some hurry away scared and recommence hustling*. I saw multi-tasking being praised for a valuable skill and years later being condemned as the new smoking. Yeah, it’s hard to catch up. ‘Wilson showed that the cognitive losses from multitasking are even greater than the cognitive losses from pot smoking. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning information while multitasking causes the new information to go to the wrong part of the brain. If students study and watch TV at the same time, for example, the information from their schoolwork goes into the striatum, a region specialized for storing new procedures and skills, not facts and ideas. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes into the hippocampus, where it is organized and categorized in a variety of ways, making it easier to retrieve it.’ Daniel Levitin, The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload Currently, everybody is about hustling. Gary Vaynerchuk made hustling a synonym of his name. Guides and books explaining how to become a professional hustler pop up like mushrooms after a downpour. Everything well-known entrepreneurs said in the past is translated to the modern version of being a hard worker: ‘they know how to hustle’. You know what? As much as I love being busy, I wouldn’t be as productive as I am, without taking time off. I do not mean a ten minutes break or actually sitting down at a table without screens to have a meal. I mean having a cut-off time in the evening when you won’t touch your mobile and computer anymore. Weekends off work. Having an hour in the morning just for your pleasures. If you are working hard, and I bet you are, you will get what you are after without self-inflicted exhaustion anyway. 3. Find mentors Not just one- find as many as you can. Do not get lured into thinking that you know everything because there will always be somebody, who has a little bit more knowledge, experience or insight. Identify your weaknesses, seek people who inspire you and follow their lead. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. 4. Be mindful of your achievements Whether it means patting yourself on the back for sending that e-mail or practising gratefulness in the evening, take the time to appreciate what you have done and set yourself on track towards empathetic life. That alone is one of the most powerful tools to rewire your brain. Change your thoughts, and you change your world, wrote Norman Vincent Peale. 5. Learn to say no Remember the movie ‘Yes Man’? Jim Carrey plays a frustrated guy, who turns his life around with one powerful world: yes. However, as fantastic as his transformation was, the real world is not as kind to self-employed, start up workers and entrepreneurs as the Holywood would like it to be. Sometimes, you got to evaluate, weigh pros and cons and not take that crazy opportunity, which makes people’s jaws drop when they hear about it. Sometimes, you have to say no because chasing stars can break your contact with earth and leave you hanging when you least expect it. Know your goals, know your worth, and choose what brings you closer to your dreams. Want to stay in touch and get more inspiring content from Impact Hub Vienna?

Andreas hat bei einem Unfall im Alter von fünf Jahren seinen linken Arm verloren. Von den Paralympics 2016 in Rio hat er eine Bronzemedaille mitgebracht. Eine passende Ergänzung zu seiner umfangreichen Medaillensammlung von Europa- und Weltmeisterschaften. Nach der Matura hat Andreas ein Wirtschaftsstudium begonnen. „Ich bin mittlerweile im 13. Semester und habe inzwischen 7 ECTS, also immerhin mehr ECTS als ich Finger habe, somit passt das“, sagt Andreas. Außerdem ist er Moderator des ORF Behindertensport-Magazins „Ohne Grenzen“. Wie bist du eigentlich zum Schwimmen gekommen? Ich habe nach dem Unfall in der REHA verschiedenste Sportarten ausgeübt, um den Körper aktiv zu halten, die Muskulatur aufzubauen und die Wirbelsäule zu kräftigen. Gerade im Wachstum ist es besonders wichtig, in Bewegung zu bleiben. Schwimmen war ein großer Teil davon, weil das Element Wasser so spezifisch und speziell ist, dass man sich, obwohl man an Land Mobilitätseinbußen hätte, im Wasser frei und selbständig bewegen kann. Das macht Wasser so faszinierend für viele Menschen, die nach einem Unfall in ihrer Mobilität eingeschränkt sind. Ich hab ein, zwei Jahre lang einmal in der Woche Schwimmtraining gemacht und das dann auf zweimal die Woche gesteigert und so ist das Schritt für Schritt weitergegangen. Ich hab nie daran gedacht, dass das einmal Leistungssport werden wird bzw. dass ich jemals Profischwimmer werde und vom Sport leben kann. Aber es war schon immer eine Liebe da zum Sport? Das Wasser hat mich fasziniert. Ich konnte vor dem Unfall nicht schwimmen, war zwar im Wasser, aber mit Hilfsmitteln und eher ängstlich. Somit hab ich keine Vergleichswerte, wie das ist, sich mit zwei Armen im Wasser fortzubewegen. Nach dem Unfall bin ich einfach durchs Wasser geschwommen, das hat Spaß gemacht und es hat Dinge gegeben, die ich an Land nicht machen konnte, aber im Wasser war das alles wurscht. Ich konnte untertauchen, ich konnte mich von unten hochstoßen, ich konnte mich von der Wand wegstoßen, Tauchen war also sehr lustig. Die anderen REHA-Patienten haben mich immer Fisch genannt. Was ist für dich das Faszinierende am Sport bzw. am Leistungssport? Mich fasziniert es, mir Ziele zu setzen und die Schritte dahin zu planen. Und dann natürlich, es nicht beim Denken und Planen zu belassen, sondern die Dinge auch wirklich zu machen. Und es gibt nichts Schöneres, als wenn man dann seine Ziele erreicht bzw. sogar übertrifft, und man weiß, dass man das durch harte Arbeit erreicht hat. Es war anstrengend, es war mühsam, aber es hat sich ausgezahlt, weil man das, was man sich vorher vorgenommen hat, geschafft hat, obwohl die Startvoraussetzungen nicht optimal waren oder sind. In meinem Fall eben das Fehlen des linken Armes. Und wenn ich sehe, dass ich mein Ziel erreicht habe, kann ich mir neue Ziele setzen, kann neue Projekte angehen. Das fasziniert mich am Sport. Foto: Michael SchatzmannSchwimmen erfordert ein extrem hartes Training. Wie schaffst du es, dich immer wieder aufs Neue zu motivieren? Oh, ja, es ist enorm hart. Es ist vieles immer dasselbe. Irgendwo hin und wieder zurück zu schwimmen. Ich hatte aber im Prinzip nie ein großes Motivationsproblem. Ich weiß, warum ich es mache, ich weiß, was mein großes Ziel ist, ich weiß, wo ich hinmöchte und ich weiß, dass ich ohne das harte, umfangreiche Training dort nicht hinkomme. Und ich glaube, diese intrinsische Motivation, dass ich es für mich selbst macht, ist sehr wichtig. Wenn ich es nur für die anderen, also Menschen die ich begeistern oder überzeugen möchte, oder aus finanziellen Gründen machen würde, hätte ich wahrscheinlich schon vor Ewigkeiten aufgehört. Wenn es mal nicht so klappt mit der Motivation, gibt es da jemanden, der dich aufbaut oder gibt es eine Technik, ein Buch, irgendetwas, wo du sagst, das baut mich auf, das bringt mich wieder vorwärts? Wenn es nicht so läuft, muss man sich die Frage stellen, wofür man es macht. Ich hatte auch schon Jahre, in denen ich meine Ziele nicht erreicht habe, wo es nicht so geklappt hat, wie ich es mir erwartet hatte. 2014 hatte ich einen Hänger. Genau zwischen zwei Olympiaden. Der Körper ist müde und man weiß, man hat noch zwei Jahre Training vor sich. Und da muss man sich immer wieder vor Augen führen, warum man das Ganze macht, einen langen Atem haben und weitermachen. Für mich ist dann auch mein Glaube eine große Bestärkung und er hilft mir, dass ich nicht emotional sofort irgendwelche Entscheidungen treffe und alles hinschmeiße. Wie fühlt sich eigentlich so eine Medaille an? Sie ist schwer. Und die Paralympics-Medaillen sind mit einem halben Kilo besonders schwer. Das ist ziemlich heftig, da braucht man schon eine starke Nackenmuskulatur. Das kann ja für einen Schwimmer kein Problem sein. Es ist etwas ganz Besonderes. Es ist das Höchste, was man erreichen kann, am Podium zu stehen, bei den Paralympics. Natürlich ist es ein Ziel, auf der obersten Stufe zu stehen, aber das kommt schon noch. Ich bin so froh, dass ich jetzt, bei meinen dritten paralympischen Spielen, meine erste Medaille holen konnte, das ist eine große Erleichterung. Man steht bei der Siegerehrung und die Medaille wird umgehängt und dieser Moment ist repräsentativ für all den Aufwand, den man in den Jahren davor auf sich genommen hat, damit man eben dieses eine Ziel erreicht. Die Medaille repräsentiert das, wofür man alles getan hat, wofür man hart trainiert hat. Mit den Besten der Welt am Podium zu stehen, das ist unglaublich! Foto: Franz BaldaufWas sind so deine nächsten sportlichen Ziele? Wir sind im Oktober 2017 bei der Weltmeisterschaft. Mein Ziel ist es, unter die Top 3 zu kommen. Und ich weiß, dass ich das Potenzial dazu habe, bei der Weltmeisterschaft und der Europameisterschaft vorne mit zu schwimmen. Es wird sicher schwer. Das Jahr nach den Spielen ist auch immer ein Übergangsjahr, man überlegt, was man sich für die nächsten vier Jahre vornimmt. Mein Ziel ist es, dort eine Silberne oder Goldene zu machen. Dazwischen gibt es sicher auch noch andere Großereignisse, Europa- und Weltmeisterschaften. Das Ziel ist es hier immer, aufs Podium zu schwimmen, mit zu schwimmen, sodass ich zufrieden sein kann mit mir und mit meinem Team und weiß, dass die ganze harte Arbeit nicht umsonst war. Gibt es im Sport für dich irgendwelche Vorbilder? Ich bin generell, aber vor allem im Behindertensport fasziniert, wenn ich die Geschichten der Sportler lese. Ich habe absolute Hochachtung vor jedem, der sich für die Parlympischen Spiele qualifiziert und es fällt mir wirklich schwer, da jemanden herauszupicken. Daniel Dias ist ein Schwimmer aus Brasilien, der mich absolut fasziniert oder Jessica Long, eine Amerikanerin in meinem Alter. Sie hat, glaube ich, schon über zwanzig Medaillen bei den Paralympics gewonnen. Sie hat schon ziemlich früh angefangen und war mit Zwölf schon Siegerin bei den Paralympics in Athen. Es ist faszinierend zu sehen, was alles möglich ist, wenn man es möchte, wenn man hart dafür arbeitet und die gesamte Bewegung begeistert mich. Was Para-Sportler weltweit in ihren Communities erreichen, mit dem was sie tun, ist unglaublich und gehört viel, viel mehr in die Welt hinausgetragen. Und abgesehen vom Sport, was treibt dich im Leben an? Ich möchte Dinge bewegen, ich möchte Menschen begeistern, ich möchte Menschen erreichen, das habe ich mir als Ziel gesetzt. Vor allem in den Bereichen, mit denen ich tagtäglich konfrontiert bin, Behinderung, Barrierefreiheit, Barrieren abbauen im Umgang mit Menschen mit Behinderung, das sind die Dinge, wo ich sehe, dass wir in unserer Gesellschaft noch viel tun müssen. Das ist das, was mich antreibt, was mich motiviert, die Dinge so zu tun, wie ich sie tue. Weil ich eine Message transportieren möchte, dass alles möglich ist, wenn man daran glaubt und wenn man etwas dafür tut. Und dass man sich nicht unterkriegen lassen muss, vollkommen egal, was einem fehlt. Das ist das, was ich in meinem Leben erkannt habe und das möchte ich auch anderen zeigen. Du bist leidenschaftlicher Sportler und seit einiger Zeit im ORF auch als Moderator eines Behindertensportmagazins tätig. Und das auch mit viel Leidenschaft. Was ist so besonders am Moderieren oder an diesem Job? Das Moderieren fasziniert mich. Man hat die Möglichkeit, in einem bestimmten Rahmen, ob bei einer Veranstaltung oder Fernsehsendung, Liveshow oder im Radio, dem Zuschauer oder dem Publikum, eine Message zu transportieren. Und wenn man richtig und gut kommuniziert, kann man es schaffen, dass etwas beim Zuhörer, beim Publikum ankommt, und das ist es, was mich fasziniert und was wir bei „Ohne Grenzen“, dem Behindertensportmagazin, versuchen, nämlich zu zeigen, dass wir in Österreich eine Behindertensportszene haben, die total aktiv ist, die lebendig ist. Und dass der Behindertensport etwas Bewegendes ist, dass er etwas Aktives ist, kein „Naja, lass ma einfach einmal die paar Behinderten dort herumtun und sich Bälle zuwerfen und nennen wir es halt Sport“, sondern teilweise wirklich beinhart, zielorientiert, und dass da Menschen dabei sind, die unglaubliche Geschichten haben. Und wir wollen zeigen, dass eine Behinderung zu haben nichts Schlimmes ist. Es ist nichts, wofür man sich selbst bemitleiden muss, und es ist auch nichts, wofür man irgendwie Mitleid von Anderen braucht. Sondern es gehört einfach dazu. Man hat es. Es ist ein Umstand, mit dem man sowieso leben muss. Und man kann genauso gut das Beste daraus machen. Und der Sport ist einfach ein Mittel, um zu zeigen, dass das Leben nicht aufhört, nur, weil man eine Behinderung hat, warum auch immer. Deine Sendung hilft auch, weil du das sehr sympathisch machst. Sie ist nicht anklagend, die Sendung. Ich glaube, dass der Behindertensport allein schon dadurch an Stellung gewinnt, oder? Das ist natürlich das Ziel, das wollen wir. Wir wollen uns auch nicht nur auf die Behinderung fokussieren. Was ich auch jetzt in der Berichterstattung rund um die Paralympics immer wieder beobachte und analysiere ist, dass nur noch über die Behinderung und die Auswirkung einer Behinderung, nicht mehr über den Menschen berichtet wird. Und das ist das, was mich stört, dieses Reduziert-Werden auf etwas, das mir fehlt, oder auf etwas, das ich nicht kann. Ich verleugne meine Behinderung ja nicht, daher kann man gerne auch über meine Behinderung berichten, wenn man über mich berichtet, aber man darf den Menschen nicht vergessen, man darf nicht die Geschichte vergessen, man darf nicht die Dinge vergessen, die der Mensch tut. Und wenn man sich nur auf die Behinderung fokussiert, gibt man dem Menschen nicht den Wert, den er verdient. Und hier sehe ich international bei der Berichterstattung über die Paralympics einen enormen Unterschied zu unserer heimischen Berichterstattung. Obwohl sich auch hier schon einiges getan hat. Ich bin total happy, wenn ich die Paralympics Peking und Paralympics London vergleiche. Aber natürlich muss noch viel verbessert werden und da versuche ich, durch unser Magazin Vorreiter zu sein und zu zeigen, dass es funktioniert, mit Respekt und mit Wertigkeit über den Behindertensport zu berichten. Wird es mit dem Sport irgendwann einmal vorbei sein oder hast du vor zu schwimmen bis du 100 wirst? Oder wohin treibt es dich dann? So lange werde ich sicher nicht schwimmen. Ich bin noch jung und kann sicher noch bei ein oder zwei Paralympics schwimmen. Aber ich werde so ehrlich mit mir selbst sein, dass ich aufhöre, wenn die Leistung nicht mehr passt. Ich war nie untätig und habe mir ein bisschen was aufgebaut. Also wenn ich jetzt in die Zukunft denke, dann kann ich mir schon vorstellen, dass ich im Bereich Kommunikation bleibe. Als Moderator oder Sportjournalist. Moderieren, auch andere Sendungen, wie z.B. Licht ins Dunkel, ist ein absolut genialer Job. Ich finde es faszinierend, im Studio zu stehen und gemeinsam mit anderen Moderatoren so eine Sendung zu führen. Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass ich langfristig in dem Bereich bleibe. Und sonst ergeben sich sicher enorm viele Dinge, auch in Richtung Marketing oder Kommunikation für den Behindertensport. Da bin ich sehr, sehr offen und flexibel und versteife mich auch nicht auf eine bestimmte Richtung. Es macht mir einfach Spaß, in der Szene tätig zu sein. Also, wer weiß. Gibt es Themen außerhalb von Sport und Journalismus, die dich bewegen, die dich interessieren oder vielleicht sogar mehr bewegen als interessieren? Ich bin ein großer Fan der Tech-Szene, aber das hat jetzt nicht unbedingt was mit dem Sportlichen zu tun. Mich fasziniert die Start-up-Bewegung, die wir in Österreich gerade erleben. Weil Start-ups denselben Prinzipien folgen, wie wir im Sport. Man ist auf sich alleingestellt, man hat keine großartigen Ressourcen und Mittel zur Verfügung, um die Welt zu verändern. Aber man tut es trotzdem, man setzt sich hin, man macht einen Plan, schaut was man tun muss und dann tut man es einfach. Das Tun ist etwas, mit dem ich mich identifizieren kann in der ganzen Start-Up-Bewegung und es fasziniert mich total. Ich interessiere mich und sauge alles auf, was sich in Österreich, aber auch international, z.B. in den USA, in diesem Bereich tut. Sonst gibt es auch noch einige Themen, die mir am Herzen liegen, wie z.B. Barrierefreiheit, Wahrnehmung und Akzeptanz von Menschen mit Behinderung und Chancengleichheit für Menschen mit Behinderung. Dass man, vollkommen egal, welche Behinderung man hat, ob einem jetzt ein Arm fehlt oder ob man querschnittgelähmt oder blind ist, trotzdem die gleichen Chancen hat, sich in dieser Gesellschaft zu verwirklichen, ein selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen und einfach sein Leben zu leben. Und da glaube ich, dass wir auch noch viel zu tun haben. Und in dem Bereich möchte ich mit dem, was ich tue, eine Vorreiterrolle einnehmen. Und könntest du dir vorstellen, selbst ein Start-up im Tech-Bereich zu gründen? Ja, sicher. Also wenn mir eine Idee kommt oder wenn sich irgendetwas auftut, dann kann ich mir das auf jeden Fall vorstellen. Ich bin halt leider kein Coder, das habe ich verabsäumt in der Ausbildung. Aber mein Bruder kann sehr gut programmieren, also brauch ich nur eine Idee … Eine andere Frage. Hast du irgendeinen besonderen Wunsch im Leben? Das ist schwierig. Damit setzt man sich im Alltag gar nicht so auseinander … Also, ich hab meine Ziele, die ich mir setze. Dass ich weiter hart arbeite, dass ich bei den Paralympics in Tokio so weit wie möglich vorne stehen kann, im Brustschwimmen und am besten auch noch im 100-Meter-Schmetterling, also auch in meiner Nebenlage. Dass ich mich breit entwickle, dass ich nicht stagniere und nicht aufhöre zu wachsen. Also, das wäre so mein persönliches Ziel. Und dass ich damit Dinge verändern, Menschen erreichen und bewegen kann. Und ich würde mir wünschen, dass ich mit all dem, was ich tue, Möglichkeiten für die, die nach mir kommen, schaffen kann. Dass ich dafür sorgen kann, dass andere die Probleme, die ich hatte, ob jetzt im Alltag oder im Sport oder in der Ausbildung, nicht mehr haben. Also das ist ein bisschen meine Vision. Fühlst du dich in Österreich als Behindertensportler ausreichend unterstützt und anerkannt? Ich bin ganz zufrieden mit der Entwicklung, mit der Tendenz. Es schaut gut aus. Die verschiedensten Institutionen tun immer mehr für die Gleichberechtigung. Das heißt, wenn man nicht behinderte olympische Sportler und Paralympics-Sportler miteinander vergleicht, sieht man, dass die Sportler fast schon gleichwertig gefördert werden. Ich sage jetzt bewusst nicht „fast schon gleich gefördert“, sondern „fast schon gleichwertig gefördert“, weil ich glaube, dass Förderungen nicht beim Geld aufhören, sondern auch damit zu tun haben, wie man mit den Menschen selbst umgeht, wie man kommuniziert. Da hat sich in den letzten Jahren sehr, sehr viel getan, vor allem auch von Seiten des Sportministeriums und der Sporthilfe. Das heißt, man hat geschaut, dass man nicht nur gleich fördert, sondern auch gleich kommuniziert, auf Augenhöhe kommuniziert. Und das ist einfach so wichtig. Das würde z.B. heißen, dass man zu Veranstaltungen nicht nur zehn olympische Sportler, sondern auch zehn paralympische Sportler einlädt, einfach um zu zeigen, dass man wirklich nicht mehr zwischen Para und Olympia differenziert. Und das muss auch das Ziel sein, in der langfristigen Kommunikation. Ich glaube, dass wir in diesem Bereich in Österreich schon gute Fortschritte gemacht haben, aber es ist sicher noch viel zu tun, auch deshalb, weil viele Menschen den Behindertensport noch immer mit Mitleidssport gleichsetzen. Diese Vorurteile sind in der Bevölkerung noch da, und da muss man schauen, dass mehr gezeigt wird vom Behindertensport, dass mehr gezeigt wird von den Menschen, die den Sport betreiben, weil die Geschichten bewegen, weil sie Menschen erreichen können. Aber das Ziel soll nicht Mitleid sein, damit man an Charity-Geld kommt, sondern zu zeigen, der ist zwar querschnittgelähmt, aber im Prinzip ist das vollkommen wurscht, er hat einen Traum und er lebt ihn. Oder in meinem Fall, dem fehlt halt ein Arm, aber das ist vollkommen egal, er kann trotzdem als Moderator vor der Kamera stehen und die Welt bereisen und seinen Traum leben. Denn Mitleid bringt keinem etwas. Hast du Tipps für unsere Leser? Für ein Buch, Musik oder irgendeinen inspirierenden Ort? Möchtest du unseren Lesern irgendetwas mitgeben? Also ich lese derzeit extrem viel. Hänge an den Büchern von Gary Vaynerchuk zu den Social Media Strategien. Weil er zeigt, dass durch die Plattformen, die wir derzeit zur Verfügung haben, die Kommunikation nicht mehr einseitig ist, sondern eine two-way-communication sein muss, und das fasziniert mich total, weil ich versuche, das auch im Sport anzuwenden. Also, wer derzeit gerade ein gutes Buch sucht, dem kann ich „The Thank You Economy“ empfehlen. Sonst: Ich höre unheimlich gerne „Praise and Worship“-Musik, vor meinen Vorträgen. Singe auch sehr gerne. Also wer Musiktipps braucht, meine Playlist auf Spotify ist öffentlich, da kann ich gerne den Link schicken. Da gibt es über 2.000 Titel an guter Musik, die Playlist kann ich insgesamt als Tipp abgeben.

No wonder! The stakes are high but the requisites even higher. You want to daze your future employer with your employability skills, character and who-you-knows but your current work history is not there yet. Have you stopped for a second to think that there is a simple and social impact friendly way to do it right within your reach? One word: volunteering. Go ahead and read these five very good reasons you should be looking out for volunteering opportunities asap. 1. It always looks good on the résumé People tend to appreciate others who volunteer and think positively about them, that’s true. After all, you contribute your time to do good for others. However, social contributions aside, employers just really like proactive and experienced people full stop. “Does It Pay to Volunteer?”, a study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, concluded that unemployed people who volunteered between 20 and 99 hours during the year were roughly 7% more likely to have found employment one year later compared to those who didn’t volunteer at all. Another US government study by Corporation for National and Community Service clearly stated of all the 70,000 jobless people they tracked between 2002 and 2012, those who volunteered had a 27% better chance of finding a job than those who didn’t. Not to mention volunteering makes you look trustworthy and points out that you are a giving person. When you apply for a job, having a “volunteered at…” section gives your personality a huge plus point, which sometimes may ootweigh the professional experience. 2. You don’t know who you might meet Maybe the love of your life? No, seriously. During volunteering you get to know new people who volunteer for (perhaps) similar reasons as you. It’s a great way to make new friends and get in touch with people you otherwise would have never had the opportunity to meet. Here at Impact Hub, we have a bunch of amazing volunteers, who found like-minded people and went ahead to set up start-ups together, collaborated or were offered a job opportunity. 3. Networking When you volunteer in a place which is in your field, you effortlessly create great networking opportunities. You gain access to decision-makers in a non-work environment. You may not get money for your contribution, but contacts are worth their weight in gold. Especially when volunteering in a place relevant to your dream profession. Making a good impression and standing out with solid work ethics might just get you noticed. 4. You test existing/learn new skill set You might be a Photoshop pro, but unless you have a solid reference and a project in your portfolio, your CV skills section is not as promising to a potential employer. This is why volunteering can become the key testing field for your skills – you will pick up on what you do well and what you have to improve. Not to mention learning a completely new skill set. Quoting after Youth Central, ‘there are eight skills that employers want you to have, no matter what industry you’re working in: communication, teamwork, problem solving, initiative and enterprise, planning and organising, self-management, learning, technology’. Yes, you got it: the majority of them are developed in a work environment. A lot of companies look for volunteers and treat them exactly the same as team members and, let’s be honest, in some places becoming a volunteer is generally much easier than getting a job. 5. A great start when you’re new in town When moving to a new place it’s not always easy to find your way and meet people. Community gives you strength to persevere but what if you haven’t found it yet? Volunteering gives you the opportunity to “do something” while adjusting to your new location, be needed and appreciated, and in general, it’s the best place to meet your future friends.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/24/stress/","ImpactHub","Stress! What can you do about it?","Stress is a part of our lives. It’s definitely a part of mine. It can be frequent and unavoidable. Whether it’s internal or external stress, it can happen in all sorts of different situations and sometimes it overwhelms us. I think everyone has felt this at some point in their lives. You get to a point where it’s all a bit too much to handle. Stress happens when we interpret a situation as a threat that will have a poor outcome. Maybe we’re overworked and experiencing burnout, or we’re under-challenged and experiencing boreout. Yes, that’s a thing. We can be so bored that it causes stress. All of this is what’s called distress or “bad stress.” But is stress always negative? It certainly feels that way. The answer is no. There’s something called good stress. What is good stress? Eustress, or “good stress” motivates us and allows us to perform in a stressful situation because we see it as a positive challenge instead of as a threat. Maybe it’s the nerves before an important presentation or a meeting with a potential investor. We can succumb to the pressure we’re putting on ourselves (bad) or we can allow it to energize us to perform well (good). We can be defeated by stress or let it inspire us. By framing a situation the right way, we can change how it affects us for the better. Remember, stress is caused by our reaction to a situation, not the situation itself. How do I manage chronic stress? Many people have difficulty managing stress and for some, it becomes chronic. Chronic stress can have a bad effect on our overall health. Sleeping difficulties, frequent headaches, and a higher likelihood of getting sick are just some of the side effects. The situations that trigger stress are different for everyone. A stressor for one person can have no effect on another. We are all unique and that’s why we need to take the time to understand ourselves and how certain situations affect us so that we can find personal solutions. As a start, we should all try to make sure that we regularly step away from work and go do activities that reduce stress. Take a walk or do a breathing exercise. It’s all about finding balance. Activity suggestions If you are looking for certain activities to relieve stress, the important thing to remember is that you need to find what’s right for you.

With the final message that it is not our innate talent that moves us forward but our “grittiness”. Available on amazon.deAs it is still January and those New Year’s resolutions are still in our notebooks, on refrigerators, and on office bulletin boards we thought we would review a book on staying power. Angela Duckworth’s Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance is an in-depth study of success and achievement. It turns out that natural aptitude is not the answer. Angela Duckworth is an eminent psychologist focusing on the psychology of success. She has snagged degrees from Harvard, Oxford, and the University of Pennsylvania. While she has published papers in many academic journals, this is her first book. She has taught mathematics at the secondary school level, worked for McKinsey (a management consulting firm that prides itself on only hiring the best and brightest), won a MacArthur grant, and now is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and has founded the Character Lab. You don’t have to be a genius The book is partially a memoir and partially an academic treatise. The very first anecdote in the book is in the Preface and it is her father telling her and her siblings that they are not geniuses. This seems rather harsh, they are, after all, children. Given her impressive credentials and career it would seem that she is indeed some sort of prodigy. And this assumption is what forms the basis of her argument. Yes, she was smart but it was not intelligence that got her where she is today. Scripps National Spelling Bee – spelling bee contestantsWhat makes a spelling bee champion a winner or a Westpoint hopeful a graduate? The first several chapters of the book introduce the readers to Duckworth’s concept of grit. She makes a statement early on in the book; “our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another”. Duckworth takes time to develop her arguments that showing up and working at skills is how people become successful. “Effort counts twice” is a refrain throughout the book and with two short word equations she makes her point eloquently; “talent x effort = skill and skill x effort = achievement”. You need to be gritty While you do not have to be a genius to read or understand Duckworth’s message you do need a certain measure of grit to make it through the book. Duckworth keeps returning to the same handful of people for anecdotes; herself, her children, the school children she Coffee for twotaught, olympic swimmers, spelling bee hopefuls, and the list goes on for a another few examples but the stories lack variety. The main body of the book, chapters six through nine, where she explains the four principles involved in grit have no pacing and move slowly. Additionally, the chapters outlining practice and purpose are a restating of the pop psychology book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink, published in 2009 (which appears in the suggested further reading section of the book). The book progresses slowly to a guide for parenting children for grit and for creating workplace and learning cultures that foster gritty attitudes. One of Duckworth’s concluding thoughts is that this is her “way of taking you out for coffee” and explaining what she knows. However, this is a very long coffee with a very verbose professor. While the message is amazing the delivery does not engage the reader.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/grit-passion-and-perseverance-600x400.jpg","January 26, 2017","en",0.989457011222839,0.00204990431666374,0.0761350467801094,0.000377148011466488,0.921437978744507
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/31/hannes-offenbacher-besser-geht-immer/","ImpactHub","Hannes Offenbacher: “Besser geht immer.”","Hannes Offenbacher – leidenschaftlicher Neudenker und Bergsteiger – kommt aus der Steiermark und lebt nach 8 Jahren Wien aufgrund seiner Liebe zu den Bergen in Innsbruck. 2002 hat er ein europäisches Netzwerk für die Absolventen des globalen Entrepreneurship Programms von Junior Achievement ins Leben gerufen. Das war dann auch gleich der Grundstein von SCHUMBETA. Er ist u.a. Mitglied des Fach-gremiums des T-Mobile Umwelt & Nachhaltigkeitsfonds und schreibt für diverse Medien Artikel über Innovation & Unternehmertum. Hannes zählt im deutschsprachigen Raum zu den zentralen Vordenkern für nachhaltiges Entrepreneurship. Und noch eins, Hannes ist Vorstandsvorsitzender der Akademischen Sektion Wien des Alpenvereins. Mit SCHUMBETA vernetzt Hannes seit 2007 Familienunternehmen mit innovativen Köpfen aus Technologie, Kreativwirtschaft und Forschung – um Wissensaustausch, Kooperationen und gemeinsame Projekte zu provozieren. Was treibt Dich an? Eine unendliche Neugier die ich schon als kleiner Steirerbub hatte, die Lust komplexe Dinge verstehen und gestalten zu können und die Freude am Manifestieren von Ideen. Und: Guter Filterkaffee. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Entrepreneurship entdeckt? Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Ich kam in meiner Schulzeit durch Zufall in ein US-amerikanisches Programm zur Förderung von Entrepreneurship – Junior Achievement – bei dem Schüler echte Minifirmen gründeten. Ich gewann damals mit meinem Team den abschließenden Österreich Wettbewerb und traf deswegen in Moskau andere Europagewinner und in Chicago die besten aus 90 Staaten der Welt. Das hat mich damals energetisiert und nachhaltig aus meinem sozialen Milieu geschossen (wo niemand UnternehmerIn war) und es war klar, dass es nur dieser Weg sein kann. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Den Wichtigsten. Unternehmerisches Denken und Handeln sehe ich als Basis für eine Gesellschaft, die vor vielen Herausforderungen steht und deswegen neue Lösungen entwickeln und umsetzen muss. Bei deinen Projekten, Initiativen versuchst du immer Nachhaltigkeit mit Entrepreneurship zu verbinden. Was liegt diesem Gedanken zu Grunde? Entrepreneurship ist von zentraler Bedeutung für die Gesellschaft – WENN – es auf nachhaltigen Werten jenseits von plumper Gier gründet. Auf der börsennotierten Konzernebene, wie auch auf der Venture Capital finanzierten Startup Szene dreht sich alles primär um den Shareholder Value. Das ist nichts Böses, aber es ist keine Blaupause für eine global vernetzte und regionale verankerte Wirtschaft, die den Menschen – und nicht nur wenigen – dient. Trotzdem bin ich überzeugt, dass es den / die InhaberIn braucht, um Innovation gegen Widerstände, mit Risiko und überdurchschnittlichen Investment von Zeit und Energie, durchzusetzen und Unternehmen aufzubauen. Du bist ein ganz besonders neugieriger Typ und auch immer offen für Veränderungen, Spinnereien. Was reizt Dich so sehr an Veränderung? Es ist wohl weniger die Veränderung, sondern mehr die Herausforderung und Freude des Gestaltens. Der Status Quo langweilt mich rasch. Für mich steht immer die Praxis der Zukunft im Fokus und wie wir Systeme verbessern können. Woher nimmst Du die Kraft für Deine Umtriebigkeit? Von den Bergen. Deshalb habe ich mich 2013 auch dazu entschieden, mein Basislager in Innsbruck aufzuschlagen – auch wenn ich natürlich die Kreativität und Diversität von Metropolen liebe. Die unmittelbare Nähe zur Bergnatur und den Luxus auch vor dem Büro am Berg Sport machen zu können, ist für mich unschlagbar und Kraftquelle. Was beschäftigt Dich derzeit am meisten? Die Herausforderung, Schumbeta für die Expansion in andere Städte vorzubereiten (aktuell Wien & Innsbruck) und zu einem Inkubator von unternehmerischen Projekten und Kooperationen auszubauen, die etwas besser machen. Wir müssen mehr Wirkung erzielen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Dich nicht geben würde? Ein treuer Bahnkunde und Weintrinker *lacht* Was treibt Dich an immer wieder neue Projekt zu starten? Die Qual des Phantasievollen sind die unendlichen Möglichkeiten. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich habe mir den Raum immer selbst geschaffen. Auch eine Triebfeder für meine Projekte. Schumbeta entstand genau aus diesem Grund – weil ich 2007 keine Szene fand, wo Unternehmertum, Nachhaltigkeit und Innovation interdisziplinär vernetzt wurde. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf die angebliche Sicherheit eines 8-5 Jobs, der heute auch schon oft ein schlecht bezahlter All-in Vertrag ist. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Freiheit von strukturellen Zwängen. Das öffnet viele Möglichkeiten für eine andere Art von Leben, das in meinen Augen viel näher an der Natur des Menschen ist und eben nicht zwischen der bösen Arbeit und der Freizeit eine radikale Trennlinie zieht. #worklifebalance Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Meine Geschäftspartnerin Nicole Arnitz ist bereits 10 Jahre lang meine Gefährtin und inzwischen Teil der Familie. Mentoren hatte ich nie wirklich, bleibt aber ein Ziel für das neue Jahr. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Eine fordernde Bergtour auf einen Gipfel. Da gewinnt man Abstand zu den kleinen und größeren Schwierigkeiten des Lebens und gewinnt Demut und Erhabenheit zurück. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Selbstverständlich. 2017 wird vieles ausgerollt, an dem wir die letzten 2 Jahre gearbeitet haben. Schumbeta wie auch Mehrblick werden im 10 Jahr in eine neue Phase eintreten, auf die wir uns sehr freuen. Mehr kann man auf Facebook oder im Newsletter erfahren <U+0001F609> Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Offen über Ideen, Motive und Ziele sprechen. Schumbeta ist ja nicht nur eine Anlehnung an „Josef Schumpeter“, sondern auch an den Begriff der „Beta Version“, den Webdienste geprägt haben, als sie quasi mit unfertigen Prototypen in die Öffentlichkeit gingen. Ein Prinzip, dass wir viel stärker leben sollten. Die Angst vor Ideendiebstahlt ist zu 99% unbegründet. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Manche wundern sich, mit was ich mein Geld verdiene *lacht*. Meine Kundenprojekte mit Mehrblick waren aber bis heute auch wenig präsent. Auch das wird sich 2017 ändern. Meine Familie liest inzwischen fleißig auf Facebook und in meinem Blog mit, was ich so treibe und feuert mit digital an Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ja – den Umgang mit der Zeit und dem Medienkonsum kritisch zu hinterfragen und schädliche Routinen zu eliminieren. Zu lesen in meinem aktuellen Artikel “2017 – kann – grandios werden.” Hast Du einen Wunsch? Das die Massenmedien ihre Negativspirale durchbrechen (oder wir sie stärker ignorieren) und die Gesellschaft ihren Optimismus und die Freude am Fortschritt wiederfindet. Wenn wir in Angst und Pessimismus gelähmt sind, wird es für die politische und gesellschaftliche Entwicklung gefährlich. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Weniger Facebook – mehr Medium.com, oder / und wieder Bücher in die Hand zu nehmen, wie zum Beispiel „Die Kunst ein kreatives Leben zu führen“. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Ambros Gasser von ASI Reisen wäre ein interessanter Gesprächspartner.

While the applications are running until the 19th of February, we decided to reach out to two 2016 program winners to check in with them and ask them about their experience. Meet Bert and DmHmT (Design meets Handcraft meets Technology). What is RE:WIEN? RE:WIEN supports start-ups/ventures that develop new solutions and try to create a positive impact on society (social/environmental impact). In an intense 6 months process, RE:WIEN works with ventures to develop their ideas further, establish smart and resource-efficient processes and build strong and sustainable businesses operating on the market. More info here. Bert – March 2016 Winner Bert is sold and advertised as a roof brand for craftsmen, furniture and furnishings, which are designed as small series. Through Autumn and Spring campaigns on specific topics (for example, seats), new products and manufacturers are being presented, which are then included in the range of the webshop and redistributed. We spoke to Ingmar Fuhrich, one of the Bert team members. What inspired you to set up your venture? After over 15 years of building furniture, I thought that it’s the time to step into the spotlight and advertise my work. But why stand alone when so many of my colleagues also do great work and struggle to increase their popularity reach? Why not bundle resources, products, ideas and strengthen the community? So the idea for the hub „BERT arge möbel“ was born! What made you apply to RE:WIEN? We consulted Christine Spernbauer from Impact Hub (https://vienna.impacthub.net/about-us/team/) regarding our project. She recommended Re:Wien, which appeared to be custom. What was the most valuable part of RE:WIEN for you? Getting feedback from experts, helped us to focus on the relevant parts of our venture. How did your business change thanks to the program? Our „baby“ became somehow more of an adult <U+0001F609> What advice do you have for the future program participants? Ask precisely what the program is all about and then make as much use of the support as you can get! Would you do the program again? I would immediately do the program again <U+0001F642> RE:WIEN Final Event 2016, 14th November Photo by Iza Hegedus. See the photoalbum here. DmHmT – March 2016 Winner DmHmT (Design meets Handcraft meets Technology) curates and designs tailor-made furniture and accessories that combine the possibilities of digital production and high-quality Viennese craftsmanship. Customers are encountered as pro-sumers, which means that the interaction with them is pro-active in order to create tailor-made solutions. We spoke to Juan Sebastián Gómez, the person behind the venture. What inspired you to set up your venture? The wish to contradict the notion that automatization will take jobs out. I saw the opportunity in mixing two opposite technologies as a message. On the other hand, re-interpreting the concept of Viennese Handcraft and placing it far beyond its glorious but gone past. What made you apply to RE:WIEN? I was looking for the way to turn the idea into a business. I lack business knowledge; putting things on paper and imagining is rather what I can do, but structuring things and creating a business is a different task. But beyond that I recognized in the program a certain support for idealism, and I believe structuring ideas as business, is what turns them into reality. What was the most valuable part of RE:WIEN for you? The direct contact and counsel by the experts. How did your business change thanks to the program? The idea got a structure of its own. However, that is no recipe for success. The business failed but proving you might be wrong or right is a part of starting something up. I neither regret starting my venture, nor having dedicated hours and neurons to the program and idea. The knowledge remains and I did knew I was risking something. Totally worth it! What advice do you have for the future program participants? Remain open minded. You can have your doubts as well, but it’s important to risk and keep doing things. If you do believe things can be better structured through the program, go ahead and do it. Now, do not expect the job to appear done by magic. The program is not even a milestone, just a guide. Would you do the program again? Yes, however I would like it to be a bit more intense. Versions: English | German You want to apply for RE:WIEN 2017?

It was a little bit shocking to see Austria not flinging itself into the confetti-powered spiral of Valentine’s Day offers and gifts, the same way England or Poland do. At the same time, you cannot help associating Valentine’s with what you see in the American movies what with the characters always being subjected to constant indoctrination persuasion of TV, radio, print, online commercials, stores transformed into red caves and POS traps screaming the need to profess undying love with raspberry body scrub, chocolates and stuffed bears. This is what Valentine’s are right now – a commercial festival, which justifies price increases by sticking hearts onto the products or adding ‘Love’ and ‘romantic’ in the copy. Inner Grump has been fed so now onto the actual topic of this post – making the celebration of love an impactful event with this socially conscious guide to Valentine’s! Throw away Recycle your stale ideas of what this occasion ‘should’ look like and join us in turning this festival of love into the festival of socially impactful love. First of All: Give Consumption a Break “I don’t need no Valentine’s Day to tell me hat I have to express my love for someone”, grumbled someone somewhere. And while in the past that person would be christened the lost sibling of the Grinch, today we would nod in agreement and go refill our reusable glass bottle with tap water. We buy too many clothes, which we don’t care about – more than 30 % of clothes in Europeans’ wardrobes have not been used for at least a year, says ECAP Summary Report 2019. In 2019, for the first time ever, we consumed 100 billion tons of new materials. According to a new research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (PNAS), “decarbonizing fast enough to stabilize the climate rests on all of us changing how we think and act – and doing it fast“. Because it is so easy to go to a store and buy something, in February 2020, we should challenge ourselves not to. Think of it as your Valentine’s gift to our planet <U+0001F30E> Fair Flowers Do you know that developing countries such as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya, Malaysia and Costa Rica are increasingly gaining bigger floriculture market share, especially in the international cut flowers export? The low-cost imported flowers sold at florists, supermarket or freshmarkets are tempting to consumers with low disposable income but little does the public know about the conditions flower farm workers have to endure to satisfy the global demand for a romantic bunch of roses. You are probably wondering why buying local is such an important element of living a conscious live. It’s about lowering your carbon footprint and not supporting companies, which ship containers of chilled cut flowers across the ocean at small cost, putting regional farms at a disadvantage. It’s making sure, you do not support companies, which pay trifling salary to whole families working in greenhouses. Local florist market in Austria isn’t exactly blooming, but what you can make sure to do is: buy organic flowers. Buying organic means: GM-free plants, treated only with natural fertilizers and farmed in conditions saving at least <U+2153> of CO2 compared to the conventional cultivation. Organic certificates also mean the producers have to comply with the EU regulations regarding fair pay. When buying flowers in Austria, look out for these labels. Sing Your Way to Someone’s Heart* Alina, one of our Hubbers, suggested people should revive serenading to bring back the romance. And why not?! We are all about gender equality so we encourage both men and women to start practicing their vocal skills. Alternatively, get a boombox. I would never leave you hanging like this, John. Source. *We cannot be held responsible for serenading yourself into troubles with the police by breaking the ‘no past 10 pm noise nuisances rule’. Give a Valentine I do not mean an actual card (although DIY Valentine’s cards are pretty cool, see below) but a symbolic gesture to celebrate the love we should show to another human being every other day of the year. Make a deal with yourself to be especially nice to the people you encounter on this day. Spread the love by saying ‘Good morning’ to your quiet neighbor and asking them how they are doing. Leave the extra change to an Augustin seller or be extra polite and patient when the morning rush at your regular coffee place is keeping you waiting longer for your caffeine fix. Invite your colleague to go out to lunch with you or text your dad wishing him a good day. It’s not words but actions that matter on days like this. DIY Recycled Gifts All the crafty creatives unite! Use recycled materials to make meaningful presents, which will always be much better than any shop bought trinket. Refresh your hardcore art skills perfected during the primary school years, when the teachers forced the whole class to decorate paper hearts with glitter and repurpose available materials. Wait…Was it just me and the rest of Polish kids that were tortured this way? OKAY. Make a playlist of your favourite love songs (remember those mixtapes?) and load it onto that USB you had lying about since 2009. Write a list of 100 reasons you love your partner on individual pieces of paper, throw in some sentimental content (the cinema and gig tickets you have been hoarding, or your photos) and pack everything into a jar – now your chosen one can fish out your love notes, whenever they feel like it. Write a poem, even if you have had 0 experience with writing poems. There’s first time for everything. Make a collage from newspaper and magazine scraps representing all the things your partner loves. Frame it and voila. Make a Valentine’s card (no drawing skills required)! Source. Gift Memories, not Things The best gifts are those our loved ones can treasure forever in their memory. The experiences do not have to be expensive – it’s about spending time together after all. Go to one of the beautiful Viennese parks and gardens for a long relaxing walk. Travel to the furthest parts of the city and explore the unexplored, for example, Steinhofgründe. Book a Shades Tour, open your mind and support local community. Have a dinner in the dark at Dialog im Dunkel. Feel like Charlie at the chocolate factory and visit Zotter Schokoladen Manufaktur. Do something from the Green Guide to Vienna list. Host a Valentine’s Day Party Who said the Feast of Saint Valentine’s should be a private affair? Gather a group of friends, be it singles or couples or mixed, and throw a love themed potluck dinner. Make it even more sustainable by applying no waste rule – all dishes have to be made from scratch and preferably with produce that otherwise would have been never bought and left on the shelf in your local supermarket. Alone. Unloved. Abandoned. #isthisguilttrippingworkingyet You could also organize a romantic comedy movie screening with a group of friends.

Roll dough into tablespoon sized balls and place in a baking dish or food storage container. Store in the refrigerator. This recipe comes from here. I hope these tips for making Valentine’s Day impactful will come in handy.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/02/10/erbeerwoche-is-tackling-taboos/","ImpactHub","Erdbeerwoche is Tackling Taboos","We have said it before, but it is worth saying again: At Impact Hub Vienna we do not shy away from any conversation and neither do our ventures. So we are going to have an interesting conversation about a taboo subject, and we are just going to put it out there right now – this is definitely an article about feminine hygiene products. Actually, even saying it that way still makes it more awkward than just being frank and open, this is really going to be about the products that women use while on their periods. Meet two women who decided that taboos about menstruation needed to be trashed. Introducing Erdbeerwoche! Erdbeerwoche FoundersErdbeerwoche is a company that was founded by Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger, who had worked as consultants in the sustainability sector. They noticed something odd – in all the conversations about sustainability the feminine hygiene sector was excluded. Annemarie and Bettina decided to fill the gap. So what does Erdbeerwoche do exactly? And that is an excellent question. They are the first company in the German speaking world to provide awareness and education regarding the choices and alternatives for feminine hygiene products. They also have a handy online store, where after reading the information on their site, you can choose to purchase any number of environmentally friendly and healthy for you alternatives to your current products for all your menstruation needs. Did you know …. “Even though menstruation happens to nearly every girl and woman every single month, people do not talk about it. This is why many women (and men!) are not aware of the social, environmental and health impacts of this taboo,” Bettina states. “Every year, 45 billion conventional hygiene products pollute our planet. The problem: 90% of tampons and pads consist of a cellulose plastic mix and that is why one single tampon takes up to 500 years to biodegrade,” Bettina continued. Watch ‘Breaking the bloody taboo’ by Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger at TEDxDonauinsel While the statistics are staggering this is not just an environmental issue but it is also a personal health issue. Recent studies have found harmful substances in standard feminine hygiene products which have been linked to abnormal tissue growth in the abdomen and reproductive organs, abnormal cell growth throughout the body, immune system suppression, hormonal and endocrine system disruption, according to an EPA draft report. “This is just one of the many reasons why it is so important to educate women and girls about menstruation and feminine hygiene.” Helping Hands at the Hub We try to provide our ventures with help and support through many innovative scaling and accelerator programs. Erdbeerwoche took advantage of the Investment Ready Program in 2016, as well as our scaling program. We sat down to chat with them about their experiences in the program. “The IRP was especially was helpful for us because we had many valuable bilateral coaching sessions with experts, starting from finance to sales and marketing. We also learned how to prepare the perfect pitch.” Annemarie and Bettina say that the three most valuable things they learned in the IRP was how to create a convincing pitch, how to find the “blind spots” and challenge their thinking, and how to ensure financial arrangements were well structured and attractive to investors. In terms of financial support “we received funding from AWS for a jumpstart – which helped to scale our venture. And additional funding for Kreativwirtschaftsscheck – to implement innovative elements in our on-line shop to improve the customer experience.” The best advice is to “inform yourself as early as you can about potential funding and get as much help as you can – Impact Hub Vienna is a great spot for that.” What is AWS? AWS stands for Austria Wirtschaftsservice and it supports incubators and accelerators as well as incubated start-ups. The aim of the collaboration between IRP and AWS is to strengthen and expand the program, resulting in a higher annual volume of investment ready start-ups and international expansion. But wait there is more …. What does the future hold for Erdbeerwoche? “We will continue with our mission to break the bloody taboo and revolutionize the feminine hygiene market until all 2 billion menstruating women in the world do not feel ashamed about their period and have access to sustainable feminine hygiene products.” It is an ambitious mission and one that we have supported from infancy through programs at Impact Hub Vienna. Are you ready to take your product or service to the next level – just like Erdbeerwoche? The Investment Ready Program is currently looking for ventures.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/02/15/austrian-social-venture-bridges-the-multicultural-gap/","ImpactHub","Austrian social venture bridges the multicultural gap"," The limits of my language mean the limits of my world, read the words of an Austrian-British philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein. Even though what he meant was that philosophy (the world) ends when the language cannot venture further, we can’t help but think that in today’s world the growing language gap creates tall impenetrable walls between the multitude of cultures coexisting in a country. The fact is, we need to talk to make our world a better place for everybody. interprAID, a social venture offering virtual community interpreting services, is set on making the dialogue happen. Founded in 2015, interprAID is the first ever online community interpreting platform enabling NGOs to find qualified interpreters in over 40 languages. The beauty of this social start up is its accessibility – the only tools you need after registering on the platform and connecting with a community interpreter is a laptop with a solid Internet connection and a webcam. With the recent influx of refugees and asylum seekers, the EU governments were faced with a completely new array of social issues. The basic human need to understand and be understood to perform not only required legal tasks, but also function in a society, became a challenge to those, who did not know the language of their new country. Even though in many countries the newcomers gained access to local language courses, the need for fluent speakers of Arabic including local Syrian dialects was burning because in many cases refugees did not speak English. Some statistics for Austria… Last year the Austrian BM.I (Bundesministerium für Inneres) registered 42,073 total asylum applications (source) of which 27,254 were admitted to the procedure post-screening. With the total number of immigrants living in Austria steadily growing year on year (settling on 14.6% in 2016, source: Statista) the need for interconnecting people is bigger than ever. However you want to look at it, we live in a multicultural reality. We contacted Matthias Monreal, the person behind interprAID and a member of Impact Hub Vienna, to ask him about his idea, what he thought of being at Impact Hub Vienna and what his plans for the future are. Where does the idea of interprAID come from? Matthias: My wife, who works within the Social/Non-profit sector lamented the fact that she could not find adequate interpreters to communicate with her clients. They were hard to find, expensive and lacked the necessary cultural competence. With interprAID we address exactly these three needs. We build a virtual pool of interpreters online, accessible via video call; we follow a marketplace approach to serve as many user organisations as possible; and we focus on the best possible match between client and interpreter by going beyond mere language selection, but including cultural, religious, ethnic and personal criteria that might be decisive for a situation of trust in which an assignment can take place in the first place. Why do you think providing community interpreting services is so important right now? Community interpreting has been around since a long while. Less so in the German speaking world, but e.g. in the UK it is well established. What has been lacking so far is proper market access for community interpreters who were so far always limited by local demand, which you can imagine isn’t that much if the language you offer is Tigrinya or Pashto. Through interprAID community interpreters have a chance to actually generate an income and thereby have an incentive to professionalise. Community interpreting is the facilitator across the entire social sector. Without it, a large group of people will be excluded from essential services our society offers. The recent refugee crisis has highlighted that and created more public awareness for language barriers, but the problem is not new in principle. Community Interpreting enables those who do not sufficiently speak the official national language to access services they need. It reduces inequality and helps to provide equal access – a basic human right. Community Interpreting is frequently needed in medical, educational, housing, social security and legal settings. It forms the basis for professional service delivery. (Source: interprAID ) What programs did you enroll in at Impact Hub Vienna? I am part of the Accelerator Programme, through the found! Deloitte program (link) and the IRP Lab. What did you think of the help you received at Impact Hub? The Impact Hub is a great environment and I wish I could soak up more of the spirit by actually being there. Since I am based in Innsbruck it’s more sporadic for me. I have attended several workshops and received mentoring and expert advice, all of which was very good. What are the three key findings from your participation in Impact Hub hosted programs? The power of the network. Don’t build you venture in a bubble, but share, talk about it, inspire and you will receive a lot of valuable input! What sort of support did you receive from AWS (Austria Wirtschaftsservice)? I have received funding through the JumpStart program and just found out today [3rd Feb 2017] that we won funding through the AWS Social Business Call. Great! In general, what is your advice for any start up owner, who is using Impact Hub and AWS services? Talk about your idea, involve others as much as possible. Where do you see interprAID going? Our vision is a world in which language and cultural barriers do no longer exclude people from receiving social services. interprAID is as much a practical tech solution to make this possible, as it will be a community for community interpreting. We want to build awareness and promote change in how we deal with language barriers and intercultural communication in our society. We need to trigger a mind-shift that changes practices and policies of how social services are provided to people who do not speak our language. We see a great need for that and great potential to generate fundamental impact at a large scale.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/interpraid-banner-600x400.png","February 15, 2017","en",0.993513286113739,0.00865604748832993,0.623389467597008,0.00461355276638642,0.363340958952904

You are doing something new to fill the void that you have spotted. Whether it is an innovative service or a gap filling product – you are trying to make a difference. However, you, as the vanguard, will run up against questions to which you do not have the answer. Fortunately, there is a platform that offers all the answers you need. Books. And in the words of Penny Arcade – they already interface well with the shelves that you have at home. Hundreds of business books are on the market. There are also hundreds of books lists on the internet that give you the 67 best business books across a range of options (okay, there was no list with 67 that we could find – but there definitely was a 73 best books for entrepreneurs). We sat down with internet search engines pushed to the max to find consensus on what the best books for social entrepreneurs might be. Turns out that no one really agrees on “the best”. So that meant that we needed to do some reading of our own. Here are our picks … Getting Beyond Better by Roger Martin and Sally Osberg This is a guide for any person looking to create a socially focused business. The book outlines the key stages for development of a social business: understanding the world, envisioning the future, building a model for change, and scaling the solution. Case studies and personal examples provide first time change-makers and experienced visionaries with inspiration and tips to move forward with their ideas. Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant While not focused solely on social entrepreneurship – the book ranges over businesses like Apple and Disney- this title provides some valuable insights on creative thinking. The book starts out with a discussion about going against the grain and the risks one takes to do things differently. With chapters covering overcoming anxiety and ambivalence, creative thought, effective collaborations, and impactful actions this is a resource for anyone thinking outside the box. Of particular note is a young entrepreneur whose marketing strategy is to outline the reasons not to invest in his start-ups. Platform Revolution by Geoffrey G. Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne, and Sangeet Paul Choudary Case studies form the basis of this book, from Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Tinder, and SkillShare, are all examined as successful platforms that revolutionized their individual markets. Digital networks are the mainstream and we need to understand how to profit from their ubiquitousness as social entrepreneurs. This book is the ultimate guide to understanding the titans of these networking platforms and to harnessing the tools for our own businesses. Sprint: How to Solve Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz The guide is based around the five day process that designer Jake Knapp (also the author of the book) developed at Google to bring new ideas to testing within five days. With social entrepreneurs being pulled in many directions it is imperative to learn where to focus your time and learn how to get answers fast. One of the many answers that seems that the answer will take the longest is product testing. Not according to this book – you can get answers in days allowing you to better your market position and product. This is an essential guide for any social entrepreneur with a gap filling product. Not every story has a happy ending … However, every happy ending is accompanied by a cautionary tale – also because we all learn from failure we are proposing this next book. Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons Dan Lyons, a successful journalist at Newsweek, suddenly finds himself without a job. And so he decided to work within the start-up industry. With a memorable cast of characters and nerf gun fights, Lyons spins a tale of a start up venture, flush with new venture capital, that spirals out of control. While this is not the story we want for ourselves, it serves as a “Don’t Do What Jimmy Don’t Does”, to quote the Simpsons. And we all need to relax sometimes … Did you know that reading fiction makes us more empathetic people? Well, it is true. According to a recent article published in Scientific American, reading fiction improves our ability to relate to others by getting us to imagine a different perspective. That means we can better anticipate the needs of our market by reading. We just wanted to give you a really good, business related excuse to read these two books, one is even a graphic novel. Monsieur Linh and His Child by Philippe Claudel A poignant portrait of what it means to be a refugee, even though it is from a different crisis in a different time, there are many parallels that can be drawn in our modern world. The overarching theme of the book is friendship and creating a dialogue between disparate cultures. Monsieur Linh finds an unlikely friend in Monsieur Bark, as all that they have in common is their individual understanding of grief and loss. This book comes highly recommended by the UNHCR. Strong Female Protagonist Book One by Brennan Lee Mulligan (Author) and Molly Ostertag (Artist) A former teen super hero is shown evidence of a far reaching conspiracy. She abandons fighting giant monsters with her super powered team mates to go to college in order to make a bigger difference. Brought to market through a kickstarter campaign it is a complete collection of the webcomic of the same name. Mulligan and Ostertag have real world experience as entrepreneurs and to trying to make a difference in the world.

You will be productive.","We, people of the Land of Passion Driven, know that we cannot afford to slow down. Your time is now. You got to hustle and bustle, give it your 101% and look i-woke-up-like-this fabulous. You should also work less and preferably four days a week, spend time on passion projects and meditate to be a successful business person. With all the contradicting advice we settle on chasing the dream 24/7 and say ‘I can’t, I am too busy’ proudly when somebody asks us out for lunch. We think we need a six-figure salary to start taking vacations. Even sleep becomes a matter of choice, rather than necessity. This is how many of us board the train headed to station Burnout Central calling at Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Doubt. Instead of making an impact, we sabotage our performance. In this article, we are letting you in on the secrets of a happy and fulfilled life as a successful entrepreneur supported by scientific data and research. Hint: it has a lot to do with taking it easy. Sleep more Sleep is an often underestimated life function by those, who have more to gain by staying up. Or have they? Arianna Huffington, the author of the upcoming book The Sleep Revolution, wrote that “We sacrifice sleep in the name of productivity, but ironically our loss of sleep, despite the extra hours we spend at work, adds up to 11 days of lost productivity per year per worker, or about $2,280.” Essentially, you are losing money by not sleeping enough! Moreover, you aren’t suffering from financial losses only by neglecting to sleep – your overall performance decreases too. Daniel Levitin states in his book ‘The Organized Mind‘ that ’sleep is among the most critical factors for peak performance, memory, productivity, immune function, and mood regulation. Even a mild sleep reduction or a departure from a set sleep routine (for example, going to bed late one night, sleeping in the next morning) can produce detrimental effects on cognitive performance for many days afterwards.’ It means that you are doing yourself a disservice if you continue skipping night rest. In fact, you should start adding power naps to your daily routine because ‘even five- or ten-minute “power naps” yield significant cognitive enhancement, improvement in memory, and increased productivity. And the more intellectual the work, the greater the payoff. Naps also allow for the recalibration of our emotional equilibrium—after being exposed to angry and frightening stimuli, a nap can turn around negative emotions and increase happiness.’ (Daniel Levitin, the same book). Action: Start by prioritising your optimal 6-8 hours of sleep per night for 30 days, which is how long it takes to build a habit. This will also force you to be more task-focused during the day but only if you are ruthless with sticking to your resolution. Tip: be extremely ruthless. Get distracted at the right time Are you 100% focused on this article or longingly looking out of the window, listening in on other people’s conversations, thinking about dinner and that pair of shoes you saw yesterday? Mental unavailability at times when you are supposed to be focused can seriously obstruct your work, but not many people know that letting yourself be distracted is an amazingly effective creativity boost. The trick is to be distracted at the right time. Some experts say that people tune things out for good reasons, and that over time boredom becomes a tool for sorting information—an increasingly sensitive spam filter. In various fields including neuroscience and education, research suggests that falling into a numbed trance allows the brain to recast the outside world in ways that can be productive and creative at least as often as they are disruptive (Source). Action: Practice doing nothing and let your mind roam – ironically planned time slots of being distracted freely are much healthier for your brain than directionless thinking during work times. Use apps such as Calm to meditate and focus on your breath. You can also schedule thought dumps couple of times per day – simply write (or record) whatever is on your mind without thinking about it too much. Space out your workload Our brains can maintain focus for 90 to 120 minutes at a time. If you work continuously for three hours straight, you put yourself in danger of fatigue. In Meijman’s view, ‘fatigue’ is a psychophysiological state that is characterized by a low level of energy, high level of irritability and a lack of motivation to exert any further effort (Meijman, T. F., 1991, About fatigue). This basically means you are unconsciously sabotaging your efforts and the quality of your worklife. Fast Company brings up the widely cited study of prodigious violinists by psychologist Anders Ericsson. He found that the top performers all had the same practice characteristics: They practiced in the morning They practiced for three sessions Each sessions was 90 minutes or less There was a break between each session Action: Follow your work periods with 20 minutes of complete reset- get up from your desk, eat lunch outside of your office, do not talk about work. You can set alarms on your phone to remind you when the break should start and end. Learn how to simply be In our society, it’s natural to value people, who excel. It’s an automatic reaction to praise an employee for leaving the office last or admiring those, who buzz from event to event. This causes a dissonance between those who do what comes naturally to them and the people, who haven’t figured out their natural affinities or are forcing themselves to do what they are not cut out for. We are adding extra projects trying to figure ourselves out instead of polishing what we are good at but too scared to pursue. A recently published book by Professor Svend Brinkmann from the Department Communication and Psychology at Aalborg University Denmark opposes the idea that everybody has to be undergoing a soul-searching self-improvement process, which is enforced by cheap self-help books. The end result of believing to be ‘work in progress’ is a constant feeling of unworthiness which drives us to work tirelessly and justify not taking a break ‘because we have to do better than that’. Action: Say no to projects, which you are doing for reasons other than making you happy. These are energy drainers, which require more time and effort to maintain. Realistically, can you outsource/delegate/skip them? Stop checking your phone The heaviest smartphone users click, tap or swipe on their phone 5,427 times a day, with 2,617 times being a daily average (source). This amounts to 145 minutes per day. While not every interaction you have with your phone is needless, plenty people habitually use their phones at work and home, not letting their brains take the needed break to process information. What’s worse, you can literally max out your brain’s capacity to memorise information by overusing technology! ‘When we attempt to stuff more information in the working memory, our capacity for processing information begins to fail’ (source). Not to mention becoming emotionally unstable: Researchers at the University of Sussex in the UK compared the amount of time people spend on multiple devices (such as texting while watching TV) to MRI scans of their brains. They found that high multitaskers had less brain density in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region responsible for empathy as well as cognitive and emotional control. (source) Action: Mute and put away your phone when resting. Use tools like StayFocused to limit visiting social media sites. Use Offtime to create tech-free zones by strategically scheduling automatic airplane modes. Go offline regularly David Solomon, the global co-head of investment banking at Goldman, told James Surowecki in this NYT piece (source) “Today, technology means that we’re all available 24/7. And, because everyone demands instant gratification and instant connectivity, there are no boundaries, no breaks.” While being able to go online almost everywhere is a technological miracle, it brought in disorders such as FOMO or FOBO, anxieties, amplifying your exposure to content you might now want to see all day long. Design a robust internal and external recovery systems ‘Internal recovery refers to the shorter periods of relaxation that take place within the frames of the workday or the work setting (Geurts & Sonnentag,2006; Veldhoven & Sluiter, 2010) in the form of shortscheduled or unscheduled breaks, by shifting attention or changing to other work tasks when the mental or physical resources required for the initial task are temporary depleted or exhausted. External recovery refers to recovery promoting actions that take place off work — e.g. in the free time between the work days,and during weekends, public holidays or vacations’ (source) Action: Plan one day a week when you will go completely offline, no excuses. Catch up on things that make you happy and come back to your workload the next day.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/07/inspiring-women-at-work-five-best-books-for-women-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Inspiring Women at Work – Five best books for women entrepreneurs","International Women’s Day happened just recently and with that thought in mind we went to our bookshelves. We found some inspiring stories of women in the workplace and women entrepreneurs – actually we found what we think are the five best books for women entrepreneurs. And we included a couple of fiction gems so that you can take some time off. While these are not all business handbooks, obviously, but they are stories of the struggles that women entrepreneurs have faced trying to balance work, family life, societal expectations, health problems, and sometimes, mental illness. These women will inspire you to keep going, or maybe, to start something fresh. From Hollywood comedy writers and internet geeks to philanthropists and mental health campaigners we have everything covered. Reading about these women has certainly reinvigorated our aspirations and work – we suggest that you check them out as well. Start with… Bossypants by Tina Fey While Fey herself is not an entrepreneur, she did have to make it in two male dominated fields – television and comedy. And she made it in a big way. She was Saturday Night Live’s head writer for a long time, as well as head writer for 30 Rock. The introduction to her book gives the only practical advice to women looking to succeed in a male workplace: “no pigtails, no tube tops.” And “some people say ‘never let them see you cry.’ I say if you’re so mad you could cry, then cry. It terrifies everyone.” And our personal favourite “don’t eat diet foods in meetings”. The book is about her childhood and her experiences in the workplace rather than a practical handbook. But her rise to fame is an inspiring story – from the lanky awkward teenager to one of Time magazine’s most influential people – it is hard to put down. Let IT Go: The Memoirs of Dame Stephanie Shirley by Dame Stephaine Shirley In 1962 Shirley created a business – Freelance Programmers. It was wildly successful. And she focused on employing women with dependents in a time when women in the workplace were frowned upon and women’s rights were marginally recognized. She called herself “Steve” to have a greater say in the male dominated business world. Her memoirs are awe inspiring; from her arrival in England as a refugee of WWII, part of the unaccompanied Kindertransport from Germany, to her philanthropic work with Autism. This is worth the read for anyone who has big dreams. Furiously Happy: A funny book about horrible things by Jenny Lawson You may know Lawson by her other name, the Blogess, which is her wildly successful web site. However, she is also the creator of the silver ribbon campaign for those who have survived (or are surviving) mental illness. This book is a look at mental illness in its various forms and introduces her new campaign. You will laugh, cry, and be scared that you identify with much of what she has to say. The tone of the book is manic and frenetic, however, if you can get beyond that you are in for stories about creating amazing memories, work life balance, and a taxidermy raccoon. You are Never Weird on the Internet (Almost): A Memoir by Felicia Day Day is an amazing internet everything. From running successful web series (The Guild), to online book clubs (Vaginal Fantasy), and getting the first internet musical off the ground (Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along-Blog starring Neil Patrick Harris). From her odd childhood and the beginnings of the internet to the entrepreneur that she has become today – Day takes us on one weird journey. While the book is light on practical business advice there is a great deal of real world experience and advice related to handling stress and health issues while creating a global brand, getting doxed during a global scandal, and handling internet trolls. Business as usual We realize that you may want a bit of practical advice if you are just starting out in the entrepreneurial world. And so, we have picked a book that is an inspiring story of a successful woman entrepreneur with some handy tips along the way. #Girlboss by Sophia Amoruso From her inauspicious beginnings selling a stolen book on eBay to her multi-million-dollar fashion empire, Amoruso will have you glued to the page soaking up every piece of advice she has to offer. From “know when to throw punches and when to roll with them” to “dream big but start small”, the book is useful for anyone who is just starting out or looking to scale up. Included in the book are portraits of other successful women that she has met along the way. While her story telling lacks a little luster there is much that can be learned from the Girlboss. Take some time for yourself Many women struggle with work life balance issues. The demands of work often intrude into our personal spaces. This is especially true of entrepreneurs for whom time at work and at home seem to blend seamlessly, and it would seem to be doubly problematic for women. So, take some time off, you know you deserve it, and read one of these fiction gems that we found for you. An Unsuitable Job for a Woman by P.D. James While this one is a trip in the way back machine, in that it was not published within the last five years, it is still valuable to consider. It is a murder mystery novel by one of the masters of the craft. Cordelia Gray is 22 years old and has just been left a less than credible almost insolvent detective agency. With no money and few options – one of them being to go back to her secretarial job – Gray pursues the case that lands on her desk. Through her investigations, Gray confronts gender stereotypes and has to work through many issues related to women in the workplace – especially women pursuing what is classically known as the men’s domain of work. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (Marvel Comics) This book is comic in both senses of the word: it is a comic book and it is quite hilarious. Ryan North and Erica Henderson bring this superheroine to life in an amazing way. Squirrel Girl or Doreen Green, as her alter ego is called, has the proportional strength and speed of a squirrel and some pretty fantastic reasoning powers to boot – although we are not completely sure if those also come from squirrels. She struggles with balancing college life “Because you need an education to help people” and her superhero duties. Often the conflict does not end in violence but Squirrel Girl suggesting another way forward for the villain. This is an excellent read if you want to have a laugh along with a powerful superhero.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiring-Women-at-Work-Five-best-books-for-women-entrepreneurs-600x400.png","March 7, 2017","en",0.993921518325806,0.196435045450926,0.0998138785362244,0.0176755943102762,0.686075493693352

Here at Impact Hub Vienna we wanted to celebrate inspiring women at work. So, we chatted with seven women entrepreneurs in our community about what they are doing and their inspiration. The United Nations theme for International Women’s Day this year is Women in the Changing World of Work. The workplace is changing, as we know, because we have all chosen a less traditional route of employment. Most of us within the community are self-employed and a staggering 63% of the community are founders or co-founders. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2016 report “economies with high female labour force participation rates are more resilient, experiencing economic growth slowdowns less often”. And sometimes that means you need to make your own job – and jobs for others. In our community Hanna Shatovich of Hanna in the House Hanna in the House is a style and career coaching service for men and women. Hanna gives talks all around the city about fashion and career, in addition to her individual services. “People inspire me. No matter if I know a person for a long time or get to know new people- I have always been interested in talking with people, how they motivate themselves, what’s really important to them, their stories, their dreams, ups and downs, to listen and talk with different people always inspires me. And fashion, traveling, seeing different places, nature, looking at the sea inspires me. While I am doing sports, while I run I get Inspired, to create something … I am a creative mind, my passion to create is inspired by many things.” Andra Slaats of Younited Cultures Younited Cultures is dedicated to rebranding migration. The colourful scarves that you often see around the Hub are a visible symbol of a positive attitude towards migrants and migration. “A beautiful picture, a moment in someone’s life captured in one photo, an image that says more than words, watching people hold hands, sharing an ice-cream with my husband. All these glimpses capture life as it is. When I take time to savor these moments is when I get most inspired.” Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger of Erdbeerwoche Erdbeerwoche is dedicated to educating women about their options for feminine hygiene products and to building a world where women aren’t ashamed to be on their periods. Their innovative and sustainable product offerings are only part of the story as they provide education on their website as well. “Every day we are inspired by many enthusiastic women (and men!) who immediately wanted to support the mission of Erdbeerwoche or have completely switched to sustainable women’s hygiene products. So far, we have already replaced 1 million conventional feminine hygiene products with sustainable alternatives, which is a huge environmental impact. In a survey among our customers in 2014 we also noticed that nearly 90% of the women questioned positively changed their attitude towards their own body and menstruation by using sustainable hygiene products. We get so much positive feedback from women, so we cannot help but spread our mission of sustainable women’s health to the world.” Klaudia Bachinger of WisR WisR is just getting started but it has lofty goals. The goal of the enterprise is to connect seniors to mentorship opportunities within companies – which allows the young to learn from more experienced individuals and seniors to feel more connected and less isolated after retirement. “I guess what really inspires me is people. Whatever I do, is inspired by the stories and experiences people share with me. I love to ask questions, observe people and listen to whatever somebody chooses to tell me. I soak up every little detail like a sponge. And then, when I am all alone walking in the woods, everything I’ve learnt, every story I’ve heard, every person I’ve met, turns into an idea or a vision. I realized that this is true for all kinds of things, music, drawing, editing, and even for business. I strongly believe that only by understanding people, you will understand how to do sustainable business. That is why I am trying to learn as much as I can from every single person I meet along the way.” Perrine Schober of SHADES TOURS SHADES TOURS is an organization that provides a glimpse into the lives of Vienna’s homeless people. Tours are given by the homeless and provide a valuable job opportunity and social inclusion for someone that is now on the outside. “I guess what inspires me most are the reactions of our customers – how much they are appreciate and are thankful for our tours. At the same time, I see the development of each of our guides, how they make their way back into a brighter and more stable life. And when I see how our cooperation partners (the social institutions) applaud our initiative and are thrilled to see SHADES TOURS’ evolution, then my heart fills up with inspiration and gratitude.” Sophie Thalhammer of Fitico Sportswear Fitico Sportswear is creating fair trade and sustainable active wear for women. So, you can have a conscience, look and feel great while working out. “I am inspired by nature, sunlight, mountains, water, being outside, listening to music, juggling …. I love being active, doing sports, to challenge myself. I love Crossfit workouts. I am inspired by people who live their passion, train hard, work hard, and strive to become better. I care about other people, about human rights, living and fair wages, equality and equal rights. I try to live a sustainable lifestyle. I try to make the world a better place.” Katharina Moser of MOSAIK – European Communication Projects MOSAIK pursues unconventional communications and creative projects to promote awareness of the diversity of Europe. Projects include Come on Over: The Quirky Europe Game, Route 28 which is an interactive event in Vienna showcasing Europe’s Diversity, and Wallpaper for Refugees a graphic learning tool for those refugees new to German language. “My biggest inspiration has always been people. Some of my closest friends, whose most personal developments I was allowed to witness, as well as people whose lives I might follow on Facebook while they don’t even know me. I get inspired by those who dare to face others with empathy, no matter the differences in their opinions. By people who think in solutions rather than problems and see myriads of colours between black and white. By those who touch our feelings, might it be through an idea they work for or a spontaneous compliment they give. In the end, it’s all about the people who touch our lives and the ones whose lives we are privileged to touch ourselves.” The global community As we said above – women’s active participation in the economy makes for healthier countries overall. Better and more equal participation in the labour force also drives political enfranchisement. Women across the world are engaging in entrepreneurship opportunities as they strive to create jobs for themselves and better their communities. What can we do to help other women, especially in the third world? The answer is easier than you think. We found two charities that are helping women start businesses and get education W.E. Can Lead and Women for Women International. So, this International Women’s Day lend a hand and as Women for Women International says, “Support a Sister”.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiring-Women-at-Work-Our-Own-Community-600x400.png","March 8, 2017","en",0.993332386016846,6.86561052134493e-05,0.348300508223474,0.00047168618766591,0.651159077882767
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/09/start-ups-use-design-thinking/","ImpactHub","Start-ups use design thinking at an early stage, but how does the journey goes on?","During the journey from defining the initial problem up to the scaling of a start-up, different approaches and tools are helpful. The “Problem to Growth & Scale Framework” combines different approaches that build on each other. The steps are especially useful for the entrepreneur, who is at the beginning of his journey and has identified a real problem that needs to be solved. The framework comprises six important steps on the way to a scaling company: Step 1: Design Thinking Step 2: Research Step 3: Co-Creation Step 4: Lean Start-up Step 5: Business Design & Agile Product- and Customer Development Step 6: Scale What is important in step 1 “Design Thinking”? Start with Design Thinking. Identify your potential users, customers and stakeholders. Recognize the true customer needs and find elegant and simple solutions. Determine a first vision of the value proposition for the potential users and customers. Use Systems Thinking and Data Analytics to understand complex issues and to gain deeper insights. How can “research” support getting market and customer figures (Should this not be “data”?) in step 2? Understand the problem and the situation holistically. Use market research and other analytical approaches to quantitatively assess the problem and the situation. Validate and supplement your findings. Why “Co-Creation” (step 3) benefits each phase? Integrate additional customers and users as well as lead users in your process. Get as much help as necessary from the outside. Search for further solutions and even more radical ideas. Work together across departmental and company boundaries. Develop first MVPs and build trust with partners and customers. How “Lean Start-up” (step 4) supports the efficient development of your offering? Use the Lean start-up approach to develop your offer with little capital. Structure the solution step by step. Due to the fast iterations the product and the business model are steadily improved and validated. Clarify the biggest uncertainties with experiments first. Why “business design and agile product and customer development” (step 5) are central for the product / market fit? In the following, the focus shifts from problem solving and finding the solution (problem / solution-fit) to the elaboration of the right business model by means of business design (product / market fit). The product and the business model are developed in an agile way. Methods such as SCRUM are helpful. Think in variants in the development of the business models. Consider service aspects (servitization) or concepts like Circular Economy (or Cradle to Cradle). What skills are required for Step 6 “Scale”? Growth is only envisaged in the last step is and the business is scaled. The product is introduced into the market. Prepare the organization for growth and scaling. Establish scalable processes, structures and platforms. Check the mind-set & skills in your organization and do not just follow a blueprint. Take the whole organization a step forward and take new ways. The “Problem to Growth & Scale Framework” is one of many methods and tools from the new Design Thinking Playbook. The Playbook (Lewrick, Link, Leifer) is now available in good bookstores and is a must-read for all entrepreneurs and innovators. For more information see the official website of Design Thinking Playbook. Michael Lewrick, Patrick Link and Larry Leifer are always looking for the next big market opportunity. They live Design Thinking in growth areas like digital transformation, and apply agile methods in product, service and business development. They practice the Design Thinking mind-set in the telecommunication industry, at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and at the heart of Silicon Valley at Stanford University. With their help various international companies have developed and commercialized radical innovations. About Michael Lewrick Michael Lewrick holds an MBA and PhD. He did his undergraduate studies New York, Munich and Nice with an emphasis on Business Administration, IT and organizational development.

Manuel hat sich für Agrarwissenschaften an der BOKU entschieden und Florian für Wirtschafts-ingenieurwesen und Maschinenbau an der TU Wien. Beide verbindet eine langjährige Freundschaft und die gemeinsame Leidenschaft für Musik und gutes Essen. Oft haben sie bei gemeinsamen Abendessen über die Herkunft und Produktionsweise verschiedener Lebensmittel diskutiert. Sie haben sich Fragen gestellt. Was kann oder soll man einkaufen und wo? Welchen Einfluss hat man als KonsumentIn? Was kann man selber machen? Und darin sind sich beide einig.– Lebensmittel sollen möglichst regional unter Einhaltung ökologischer und ethischer Aspekte produziert werden.– Der/Die KonsumentIn entscheidet selbst was und wie Produziert wird, durch die erzeugte Nachfrage.– Durch Einkauf direkt beim Produzenten werden diese am besten unterstützt.– Jede/Jeder hat die Möglichkeit, wenn auch nur im kleinen Rahmen, etwas zu bewirken. Hut & Stiel steht für StadtLandwirtschaft, unter Verwendung lokal vorhandener Ressourcen und umweltschonender Prozesse. Kern des Projektes ist die Zucht von Speisepilzen auf Kaffeesud – ein Abfallprodukt mit großem Potenzial. Der Kaffeesud von Wiener Kaffeehäusern, Restaurants, Hotels und Pensionistenheimen wird eingesammelt und in einem Altbaukeller im 20. Bezirk weiterverarbeitet. Die frisch geernteten Pilze werden direkt mit einem Lastenrad ausgeliefert bzw. auf Märkten verkauft. Kurze Transportwege garantieren höchste Qualität und Frische. Am Ende des Prozesses wird das verwendete Pilzsubstrat kompostiert und somit zu Dünger verarbeitet. Dadurch schließt sich der Kreislauf und Abfall wird vermieden. Was treibt Euch an? Unsere Ideale stehen an oberster Stelle unseres Handelns. Wir möchten: • ressourcenschonende Wege gehen und Kreisläufe schließen• gute, gesunde Nahrungsmittel herstellen• zeigen, dass Abfall weit mehr ist als Müll• in den Köpfen der Menschen etwas bewegen und sie motivieren selbst aktiv zu werden Welche Bedeutung haben Lebensmittel für Euch? Lebensmittel sind für uns mehr als ein Füllstoff. Neben Geschmack und Genuss liefern sie uns auch alle wichtigen Nährstoffe. Bewusste Ernährung ist für uns sehr wichtig. Wann habt ihr die Liebe für Pilze entdeckt? Die liebe für Pilze allgemein kam eigentlich erst durch das Projekt. Davor haben wir bis auf die gängigen Pilzsorten (Champignon, Steinpilz, Eierschwammerl, etc.) nicht wirklich viel mit Schwammerl am Hut. Als wir uns näher mit dem Thema befasst haben wurde aber schnell klar was für ein unglaubliches Potenzial in ihnen steckt und wie wichtig sie für das gesamte Ökosystem sind. Sie sind in der Zubereitung vielseitig einsetzbar und wir können auch nach nun fast zwei Jahren immer noch nicht genug von ihnen bekommen. Warum gerade Pilze? Pilze sind in der Lage die Nährstoffe die im Kaffee stecken für ihren Stoffwechsel zu nutzen. Wir können mit ihrer Hilfe ein Abfallprodukt recyceln und damit ein qualitativ hochwertiges und gesundes Lebensmittel regional zu erzeugen. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Lebensmittel in Eurem Leben ein? Einen sehr hohen. Jeder Einkauf ist auch ein Stimmzettel welche Art der Lebensmittelproduktion und des Konsums man haben will. Was verbindet ihr mit gutem Essen? Geschmack, Genuss und im besten Fall auch gute Gesellschaft. Welch Rolle spielt Nachhaltigkeit bei Euch? Nachhaltigkeit ist ein fundamentaler Aspekt in unserem Projekt. Wir versuchen alles was wir tun so nachhaltig wie möglich zu machen. Dabei wollen wir so wenig CO2-Emissionen wie möglich erzeugen, darum liefern wir unsere Pilze mit dem Lastenrad aus. So wenig Ressourcen wie möglich verbrauchen bzw. vorhandene Ressourcen zu nützen und Kreisläufe schließen. In der Natur gibt es keinen Abfall, das machen wir uns zum Vorbild. Wir wollen in der Umsetzung möglichst konsequent sein und alle Bereiche abdecken. Deshalb ist es uns auch wichtig als eine Art soziale Komponente auch Bewusstseinsbildung zu betreiben. Wir bieten Workshops und Führungen an um den Leuten das Thema Pilzzucht näher zu bringen und sie hinsichtlich Resourcenverschwendung, Lebensmittelproduktion und Konsumverhalten zu sensibilisieren. Was war früher da, die Idee mit Pilzen etwas zu machen oder einfach die Liebe zum Unternehmertum? Die Idee ist einem Universitätsübergreifenden Seminar zum Thema Entrepreneurship entsprungen. Also war wohl das Interesse am Unternehmertum zuerst. Allerdings war von Beginn an klar das die Idee entscheidend ist ob das Gründen eines eigenen Unternehmens in Frage kommt. Wo seht Ihr Euch den nächsten Jahren? Gibt´s Expansionspläne? Wir halten gerade unsere Augen nach möglichen neuen Standorten offen. Wir wollen möglichst viel Kaffeesud vor der Entsorgung retten und stoßen dabei mit unserem derzeitigen Standort an die Kapazitätsgrenzen (600kg-Kaffeesatz/Woche). Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Räumliche Gegebenheiten und Lage: Möglichst große Flächen idealerweise in Zentrumsnähe sind schwer zu finden. Es sind aber auch Standorte etwas außerhalb denkbar. Technische Umsetzung: Belüftung, Klimatisierung, Misch- und Abfüllanlagen zur Substratherstellung, innerbetriebliche Logistik, Finanzierung, Erschließen neuer Kaffeequellen und Logistik, … Seid ihr neugierige Menschen? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich würde schon sagen, dass wir neugierige sind. Wir interessieren uns für viele verschiedene Themen schauen uns alles an und wollen vieles selbst ausprobieren. Meistens haben wir gleich mehrere Sachen die wir parallel starten. Da ist es sogar manchmal schwierig den Überblick und den Fokus fürs Wesentliche nicht zu verlieren. Was bedeutet Glück für Euch? Puh, das ist wahrscheinlich die schwierigste Frage im ganzen Fragebogen. Wir haben auf jeden Fall Glück eine Arbeit zu haben hinter der wir zu 100% stehen, wo man gerne hingeht und dabei auch noch Zeit mit lieben Menschen verbringen kann. Selbstverwirklichung und wertvolle zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen in einem sozusagen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Zumindest zwei Schwammerl <U+0001F609> Worauf verzichtest Ihr, um Eure Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Hauptsächlich auf Geld und Freizeit. Wir verbringen viel Zeit im Keller und verdienen dabei relativ wenig. Das Privatleben kommt dabei schnell zu kurz. Ist Wien ein guter Boden für Start Ups? Schwer zu sagen. Wir sind ein relativ untypisches Start-up im Bereich Landwirtschaft. Mit unserem Konzept sind wir in vielen Bereichen ein Sonderfall und es ist oft schwierig klare Auskünfte zu speziellen Fragestellungen zu bekommen. Uns war vor Projektstart nicht klar ob wir das überhaupt machen dürfen was wir vorhatten und es gab viele Fragezeichen. Wir haben uns davon aber nicht abschrecken lassen und haben losgelegt, weil wir glauben, dass man immer Lösungen finden kann wie es dann klappt. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? In unserem Fall wäre eine Art Wegweiser recht hilfreich gewesen. Wir sind zu verschiedenen Magistraten, Beratungsstellen usw. gelaufen und sind dann meist ohne klare Auskunft weiter verwiesen worden. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Euch ein? Wenn man mit einer Situation unzufrieden ist kann man sie entweder so hinnehmen oder selbst etwas dafür tun damit es besser wird. In unserem Fall war es die Ressourcenverschwendung und die nicht nachhaltige Lebensmittelproduktion die uns gestört haben. Da wir selbst jetzt sozusagen Unternehmensgründer sind hat dem ganzen Thema Entrepreneurship ein wenig den Schrecken genommen. Wenn man von einer Idee überzeugt ist sollte man sich daran wagen sie umzusetzen. Das Risiko damit zu scheitern ist wahrscheinlich nicht so groß wie sich 20-30 Jahre später fragen zu müssen “was wäre, wenn ich mich damals getraut hätte?” Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Die schönste Arbeit ist für mich das Schwammerl ernten. Da sieht man direkt wofür man sich abmüht. Außerdem ist das am Markt stehen bzw. das Ausliefern der Pilze immer eine gute Abwechslung und man bekommt direkt die Wertschätzung für das Produkt zurück. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Unsere Freunde und Familien haben uns während der intensiven Startphase immer unterstützt. Neben moralischen Beistand waren sie auch tatkräftig bei den Renovierungsarbeiten dabei. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Es gibt immer Aufs und Abs. Wir versuchen uns immer so gut es geht gegenseitig aufzumuntern, wenn mal einer nicht gut drauf ist. Unsere Freundschaft ist da sicher kein Nachteil. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Es gibt noch einige Projekte an denen wir gerade intensiv arbeiten. Geheimnisse gibt es bei uns eigentlich nicht. Im Frühjahr werden wir etwa unseren Garten zu einem Pilzgarten machen. Außerdem wollen wir die Pilzzucht für zu Hause ermöglichen und auch unseren Pilz-Kompost anbieten. Langweilig wird es auf jeden Fall nicht. Wohin es genau gehen wird ist jedoch schwer abzuschätzen. Jede Woche ist anders und oft kommt es anders als gedacht. Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Anfangs waren einige eher skeptisch, aber mittlerweile sind eigentlich alle positiv Überrascht was wir in den letzten Jahren zustande gebracht haben. Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Dass das Bewusstsein für Ressourcen und Lebensmittel steigt. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/17/recipe4change-stellamina-blog/","ImpactHub","Recipe4Change from Stellamina blog","Is there a recipe for sustainability? A bunch of ingredients that, when thrown into a pot, cooked and placed on a plate, will right all that is wrong with the world? I wouldn’t prepare anything but that every day, just to give everyone a taste of it; but it would only be really, truly good if everyone had something on their plate. Something nutritious, locally produced, pollutant-free and fair. A goal that is, unfortunately, still far away – yet every little thing we do can help to reach it. This is exactly what the campaign from SDGF wants to draw attention to, calling for a global challenge: #Recipe4Change, a competition for sustainable cooking. How our Recipe4Change happened… Jo and I could not help but be creative and show what “sustainable cooking” means to us – it’s so much more than just consuming cabbage in winter and tomatoes in summer. For us it’s about integration, improvisation, balance, health, fairness and, last but not least, taste! That is why we want to introduce you to a recipe that offers lasting enjoyment on the plate, and to share some tips to help you recreate it at home. We are all aware that our diet affects our health and our bodies -and most of the time, we can feel it too. After all, “you are what you eat” appeals to our body consciousness; but what about the health of the environment, the impact that we do not immediately see? What we eat, how we harvest ingredients and cook them also leaves traces. We are talking about the producers, the transportation routes, the packaging, the energy, the water and the forest. Who tells us: “The world is what you eat.”? “Food should not be a threat to sustainability, but a source of sustainable development.” say the Roca brothers, who have made this ideal the goal of their mission as UNDP goodwill Ambassadors. Part of their campaign is the monthly competition, which entered its third round this January. Photo © Amina StellerChallenge 1. Avoid processed foods Jo and I first met at ImpactHub Vienna and discovered our similar passions quickly. Local ingredients are just as important to us as a balanced diet and gentle preparation. We also try to produce little waste and instead garner as much as possible ourselves. The secret for us lies in reducing everything to the essentials – the real passion in the discovery of other cultures. To use unprocessed ingredients as much as possible is an obvious go-to for both of us, but a rarity nowadays. Look in your local supermarket, you’ll soon discover that fresh food might make up only around 20% of the available produce, if anything at all. Even vegans often fall into the trap of believing that by buying soy sausages they are doing better than they would by purchasing a piece of meat. This is true in terms of animal suffering; but not when taking the cultivation of soy, the rainforest, packaging and transportation into account. When looking at those other aspects, there is not much sustainability left. In addition, processed foods almost always have lesser nutritional values than fresh ingredients. But there are exceptions, which our recipe proves. The idea for the recipe came from Jo, who let herself be inspired by her Korean roots. Adapted to Austrian norms, the recipe looks a tad different. The traditional rice rolls are usually wrapped with nori seaweed leaves, but finely chopped seasonal vegetables are the better choice in this country. The tofu comes from small Viennese producers, handmade and unwrapped instead of packaged. The salad is chosen depending on the season. The cucumbers provide the perfect taste of summer. Only the peppers and the few drops of soy sauce still require further thought. Though this recipe will blow your guests out of the water at the next dinner party, we think the real ingredients for sustainable food are interest, curiosity and openness of people at the table, those who produce the food and the stories behind all of them. We also want to bring awareness to alternatives, options and experiments. As we have already mentioned, tofu does not necessarily have to come from a box- and seaweed doesn’t have to be seaweed. Search for sustainable alternatives that are fun – be curious and trust yourself. PS: I have provided vegan alternatives where needed. Do not be frightened by the many ingredients. Nimble hands can conjure up the work in just one hour. Photo © Amina StellerOur #Recipe4Change – Korean Rice Rolls, Reinvented. Ingredients RICE ROLLS 2 cups short grain white rice 1 carrot 1 cucumber 125g firm tofu 1 egg (egg replacer mixed with chia seeds) 1Tbsp sesame oil 2Tbsp vinegar (apple or rice vinegar) 2Tbsp water 1Tbsp black sesame HEALTHY CHILLI SAUCE 1/2 cup baked almonds 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (nutritional yeast) 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup chili oil Garlic (amount depends on preference) ½ tsp ginger powder ½ tsp peper powder 1 tsp paprika powder 1 red paprika GARNISH 1 bowl of any seasonal salad Red paprika, cubed White radish, cubed Almond flakes 1 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp pumpkin oil Preparation ROLL + Thinly slice the carrot and cucumber, season with pinch of salt and soak up any excess moisture with some kitchen towel. + Bathe the tofu in boiling water for 3-5mins, season with a bit of salt and sesame oil, this will also reduce any unpleasant aroma. Allow the tofu to dry, and then cut it into small sticks. + Whisk the egg and make an egg pancake in a non-stick frying pan, before the egg is fully cooked add a stick of tofu and wrap the egg around it. + Boil the rice, and add sesame oil, black sesame, vinegar and water into the cooked rice. Mix and allow to cool. + When everything is prepared for the rice roll, just roll it! Place a handful of the sliced carrot or cucumber, spread a layer of rice, and place prepared tofu stick and roll. + Place the roll in the fridge to set while you prepare the sauce. SAUCE + Grill the whole paprika until the surface is blackened. + Remove the burned part and cut it in big cubes. + Add all the ingredients for the sauce to the mixer and blend until smooth. FINISHING UP + Cut the cooled roll into bitesize pieces. (Tip! It’s easier if you use a wet knife blade) + Set the sauce on the bottom of the plate and place the rolls. + Add prepared salad on the side. + Prepare the garnish, and add the salad dressing (soy sauce + pumpkin oil). Our tips: Avoid processed ingredients as much as possible: try to use fresh, seasonal ingredients as the basis of your meals and to make use of processed food only in small amounts. Bring color and variety to your plate: Color brings not only happiness, but also healthiness. Basically, the more colorful your food, the more nutritional values it has in most cases. PS. only when talking about a natural color <U+0001F609> Check the ingredients: When buying processed foods, the easiest trick is to see if you understand each term on the list. If so, opt for those products with little additional additives and durability substances. Reduce the amount of salt and sodium: You would not believe all the things salt is in. Salt is fundamentally important for us, but the amounts which are found in processed foods exceed our daily needs by far! Instead, cook more by yourself and try to spice up the meal with spices and rich-flavored vegetables. Boil, grill and steam: These preparation methods will not only save you a lot of fat, but also get more nutrients and taste. They also consume less energy than frying. “Sustainable” cooking cannot only be entertaining as hell and taste incredible, but also brings people and the stories of the day together. Jo and I have learned an incredible amount about each other during cooking and photographing, and we have also learned to share another common trait – smiling in and out of the kitchen!

Barbara Windtner is a filmmaker and dance teacher. Her latest film, “Searching for Isolde“, a dance road-documentary about the search for choreographer and dance pioneer, Isolde Klietmann, is a heartfelt exploration of the life of its subject and a love letter to the art of dance. Barbara is currently developing her next film. We chatted about the Hub, what inspires her, and her love of chocolate. What brought you to the Hub? Barbara: A friend of mine, who does workshops here at the Hub, told me to come and check it out. At the time, I had already spent around two years at home editing “Searching for Isolde” and I was just fed up with my room! I needed to be around people. So I came over to look at the Hub—I immediately liked it and decided to join. Tell me a bit about your childhood. Where are you from? I grew up in Sankt Florian, a small town in Upper Austria with around 6,000 people. The main attractions there are the St. Florian Monastery and my family. We go back generations—my grandparents, my parents, my parents cousins, my cousins—let’s just say that there are quite a few people with my last name! It’s a nice place in the countryside, peaceful, relaxing, and I feel that it was a great place to grow up. My grandmother had a farm so there were always animals around which was a lot of fun for my sisters and I. How did you end up in Vienna? What do you love about the city? I came to Vienna to study Theater and Communications. I’ve always been drawn to larger cities and I really enjoy city life—the culture that’s created in a city with lots of people so I really love Vienna. I also lived in Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador for some time and loved it there as well! It was an important experience that made me realize that although Vienna might be less vibrant than these cities, I’ve learned to appreciate some of the things that we often take for granted like safety and a well functioning public transportation system. And culturally and artistically Vienna is a very enriching city. So I am back! What drew you to filmmaking? As a child, I liked writing—I really wanted to tell stories or be in stories. I also liked taking pictures, composing shots, but it was mostly a hobby. When I was a teenager, my dad gave me a camera and I just filmed everything. In between having fun making James Bond-like short movies, I made a documentary about my friend’s animals. That was my first documentary. And then I kind of forgot about it all for a few years until I saw a couple of TV documentaries that I thought were really well done. At that time, I thought I was going be a radio host because I had spent quite a lot of time doing radio work in Vienna and Upper Austria during the summer holidays. But then I thought about film and just got back into it. I went to Buenos Aires to study it and together with my great film companion Iván Marín from Columbia, we did our first short documentaries. Film is the combination of everything I was ever interested in: words, image, and sound. To me, it’s the most complete art form. What inspires you to tell stories? Curiosity. If I don’t know something, I just want to learn it. This curiosity fuels my projects because I want to discover more about a subject. Right now I’m working on a film about motherhood and family life—things I don’t know very much about from personal experience—but I’m interested because I want to know more. Social issues also light that storytelling fire inside me. I want to shine a light on these issues because it bothers me how certain groups are treated. I’d like to think that if I tackle an important subject through a film, capture the humanity of it, the audience will leave the film and realize that in the end, we’re all one and the same. How was the production of “Searching for Isolde”, your first feature-length film? What difficulties did you have to overcome? The difference between “Searching for Isolde” and my other previous short films was that I made the decision that I wanted to get this film financed and have it shown in cinemas. My short films were often just me, grabbing my own camera and doing it. This time, I thought that I would get some producers on board but they ended up turning the project down because they simply weren’t particularly interested in dance. So I ended up mostly producing it myself anyway together with Ulrike Hager, who had the initial idea for the documentary. That was probably the first stumbling block. Next was the financing. We never got all the money that we needed but I pressed on anyway and kept the production going. We were lucky that a great part of the production took place in Argentina which allowed what little money we had to go further. After filming was completed, I thought things would go a little smoother but then my editor suddenly dropped out of the production. He handed me my 1 Terabyte of footage and left for another job. So I ended up having to edit the movie myself as well which took way longer than I thought it would. Fast forward a couple of years, the movie’s done and then there were distribution issues. I couldn’t find a distributor! Even though we were the opening film of the Crossing Europe Film Festival and got a lot of press, no one was interested. So I ended up taking that on as well. Looking back on it all, there were quite a few difficulties. But when you believe in a project, you just have to keep going. Tell me about what dance means to you and what part does it play in your life? To me, dance is the most basic thing in life—it’s through your body. To move with music, to be in contact with what I consider to be your base and essence, the body, to get in touch with the physical world, to feel rooted to the Earth—dance has had and still has a positive impact in my life. It allows me to center myself and get out of my mind for a bit. I went to a session once with a dance therapist in Brazil and we had to dance one-by-one in front of everyone which can be very embarrassing. Towards the end, he made us all jump together over and over like I’ve never jumped before. I don’t think I’ve ever felt more energy than after that class. The intensity of it was overwhelming but in a good way. Dance can have that power. What are some films that you enjoy? “The Gleaners and I.” A great documentary by Agnès Varda. I love how it’s very much from her personal point of view. I like Woody Allen films, the older ones, like “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan.” I find his neuroses, which I don’t understand at all, very funny. “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” I just think it’s such a beautiful film. What food can you not live without? Chocolate. Any kind. But mostly milk chocolate with hazelnuts! What do you love about the Hub? I love meeting the other members! It seems like every other day I meet someone knew. I love how many of the members are social entrepreneurs looking to make a positive impact in the world and I find that inspiring. What else are you up to? The Shake Off! It’s the biweekly dance sessions that I run here at the Hub. All members are welcome! You absolutely don’t need to know how to dance and most importantly, there’s no wrong way to dance! It’s a lot of fun and the idea is to take a small break from sitting in front of the computer all day, to shake off all your tensions, and to fill your body with real energy instead of that third or fourth coffee. Don’t get me wrong, I love coffee, but I believe that there is a natural energy within ourselves we can activate through some simple movements. Check the events page for the next session!

The sun is shining and the birds are singing. And I feel an uncontrollable urge to clean my apartment. So, it must be spring. This year, I wanted to do things differently. Don’t worry, I still scoured my apartment but it got me thinking … was there a way to clean impactfully? And I do not just mean by using environmentally friendly cleaning products – like vinegar and lemon or eco cleaners. I mean by making lifestyle changes. Although, if for you making an impact is using eco-friendly chemicals then check out Lunzers Mass-Greisslerei. In our latest tradition of providing you with the tool kits to have impactful holidays (because spring cleaning is a kind of holiday, right?) we wanted to give you some tips on how to have an impactful spring clean and the changes that you can make along the way. Shared Spaces I wonder what it looks like when the window isn’t dirty? We share our homes with the people we love. We see them almost every day. Why not make spring cleaning a day to spend with your partner? Cleaning for a whole day sounds like the worst kind of date. However, there with little else to focus on except how much sunlight is not getting through the dirty windows, you can focus on your partner for a day. And at the end of it you can admire what you accomplished together. Breakfast of champions While you have cleaned weekly all winter we both know that you are planning to tackle a lot more with your spring cleaning. And it takes a lot of energy – so why not start out with a hearty breakfast. My partner and I made vegan strawberry oat bars for our spring cleaning adventure – they were delicious and filling. If you can get past the profanity on this vegan cooking site you are in for a real treat with these fruit-filled bars. And who knows, eating more vegan meals might be something that you adopt eventually – because these bars taste really good. A place for everything and everything in its place Getting more organized is something for which we all strive – and some of us are more successful than others. However, organization is not all it’s cracked up to be, according to Tim Harford (and you can catch up on that with this blog post). So you can use this an excuse if you really do not want to clean. However, sometimes it is nice to clear away all the clutter. Sometimes getting organized just means tidying up in a more mindful way (this means remembering where you put things). However, the disorganization of pantries, drawers, and cupboards is enough to drive one crazy (especially, if you are an organization maven). It is hard to create an organized space with different sized packages and boxes that contain sugar, flour, pasta, lentils, and everything else – not to mention terrible for the environment. Fortunately, Lunzers Mass-Greisslerei is here to help you out. Lunzers sells reusable containers for all the bulk food in the shop. You can buy a container, fill it with just the right amount for you, and then take it all home with you. When you return the next time, just bring your containers with you and refill them. It is simple. Suddenly, you have an organized cupboard that also has the added benefit of being better for the environment. Less is more The blue and orange clash – that is why I didn’t want your shirt. As we put away all our winter gear – from the snowboards to the winter jackets – we find ourselves looking at the array of clothing that we may not wear. Some of it is seasonal (we do live in Austria and that means winter) and some of it you are just don’t wear anymore because you are tired of it. And you find yourself wondering what to do with the shirt in your hands that you have not worn for a year. Well, you have a variety of options. You can use the clothing donation bins located conveniently close to the recycling bins in your neighbourhood. You can ask a friend if they want it – but they might not. Or you can come to the next clothing swap at the Impact Hub (and invite your friend who didn’t want your shirt – they might want someone else’s). So, you can refresh your wardrobe by swapping clothing with people here at the hub – get something new to wear and have no change in your ecological footprint while eating snacks and sharing a drink with the hub community. A penny saved Often, as I go through my closets and cupboards, I find things that need repair. My first instinct in the past has been to buy a new thing – whatever it was. However, I find myself repairing things these days. Partially, because I want to figure out how the toaster works but also because I really like that pair of sandals I just took to the shoemaker. Road works are a kind or repair. I am not the only one that has started thinking like this. Sweden is starting to offer tax credits for people who repair rather than buying new. In Vienna, you can take the item to any number of craftspeople who specialise in whatever you need repaired. However, there is a new trend hitting the market – the repair café – and Vienna has one. This innovative concept is where you take or thing that needs repair and you work with someone who is an expert to repair it together. It is a community initiative, hoping to bring people together and to prevent waste at the same time. At the end of the day It seems that you can accomplish a lot more than a clean home when you set about to clean more impactfully.

Who doesn’t love some good quest against the inconceivable might, the same one the Lord of the Ring team embarked on, right? We decided the famous fantasy trilogy is not only an exciting read but also a real magical fountain of universal entrepreneurial lessons every changemaker should take to heart. Don’t by shy and read on to learn how to navigate the tricky entrepreneurial paths of your private Mordors! #1 Team up with People, who are Different Look at them all! The fellowship came in all sizes and races. Each of the team had unique unequalled skills – Legolas could see across terrains and never missed with his bow; Gimli’s axe and fearlessness (not to mention staggering self-confidence) kept the foe trembling; Aragorn knew fancy herbs and navigated as if he came equipped with a high-class GPS system and so on… From the outside, the group seemed like a random mix, but the glue of common enterprise for the greater good brought them together. The Fellowship of the Ring aka the well-performing powerhouse shows us how teaming up with people of different personalities, expertise and skills makes sense when exploring the unknown. A much needed voice of reason.>>> Tip: Even if you are a solopreneur, you still need input. Being a member of Impact Hub Vienna means you get access to experts, who live the social impact life. Check our membership packages here or, if you already are a member, check our current programs.Oh and we recently published a handy guide on how to make the most our of your membership. #2 Do not Build Teams of Orcs Having a team made up of people with the same set of skills or character can be a right downer on your productivity, effectiveness, idea-generation and harmony. Let’s take Orcs. Orcs are murderous, vicious, blood-craving and it’s safe to say that, just like mass-produced Uruk-hai, Orcs are pretty consistent in what they want (meat), what they like (kill) and how they get what they like and want (hack repeatedly). This is a great example of how meetings with orcs would go: Tip: Avoid pairing yourself with people with the same personality as yours. When you are an idea generator, make sure you get a doer. If you prefer to run analysis and reports, find a strategist who will implements data-driven solutions. #3 Have a mentor In the books, there will always be somebody smarter, older or more immortal than any character. The chain would just go up and up. And the way the hero and heroines went about it was to respect their mentors and learn from them. With all their might and (sometimes royal) status, the Fellowship would always look up to Gandalf. With all of his wisdom, Gandalf never feared asking Saruman for help (even though he turned out to be a righteous and, to quote Jennifer Cornick, ‘rainbow bastard because he went from “the white” to “many colours‘). Alrite.Tip: Search for a mentor within our global or local Impact Hub Community (to learn how to do it, see this post!). Mastermind groups are one of the best growing tools for entrepreneurs. #4 Know your ecosystem Remember the scene in the ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers’, when an Ent, Treebeard, takes Pippin and Merry towards Isengard? He steps out onto a plain, which once had been populated by his tree-friends, and sees tree stumps peppering the swidden around the tall tower and the soil blackened from the Orcs’ slash-and-burn. This is when it becomes apparent that Saruman did not factor peeved tree-men in to his mighty plan. Just like that, the ecosystem where you decide to nest your business plans should be scanned and scouted for threats and opportunities. Otherwise, one day you might find yourself in an unpleasant and unexpected situation. Had Saruman done his SWOT analysis, he wouldn’t have his house stormed by a group of Fangorns. “Damn, we did not factor assault into scaling risks”#5 Break the Rules Sometimes When Eowyn was sent away to rule in the king’s stead, we all thought she would succumb to the obedient role her elder had envisioned for her and her trip would be done just right and there. This is why some of us were left speechless when she broke the rules and chose her fate, riding into battle disguised as a man. She not only showed some prime sword work but also ended up killing the scariest enemies of all – one of the Black Riders. As an entrepreneur, there will be many moments you will be told to take it slow or skip on your dream because it seems too risky. Bah, you will be told you don’t have what it takes! But why should you back down, when the gut feeling is telling you that you can do it? Had Eowyn listened to her mentor, she would have never proved to herself she could fight the way her folks did. In the end, her courage gave strength to the troops and saved them from a much worse fate. #6 Don’t be a Solo Ring-bearer We all felt it – when Frodo succumbed to Gollum’s persuasion, and Sam was sent off, our hearts broke, and our fists wanted to connect with Mister Baggins’ face. The faithful companion came back to salvage the day, and the journey of two Hobbits continued. Don’t presume you have to do everything yourself, don’t think that sharing your workload will lower the value of your success. Luckily, here at Impact Hub Vienna, we do everything to make sure you know you are not alone! You are a part of a booming community of doers, who are itching to help you walk in and out of Mordor with all your fingers intact. Tip: Feeling lost? Go and talk to one of Impact Hub hosts or join one of the many community events Impact Hub Vienna organizes each month. #7 Venture into the Unknown You know Hobbits? The unadventurous breed of humanoids, who will eat six times per day, smoke pipe-weed and avoid attracting unwanted attention? Had it not been for Bilbo Baggins, with his unusual taste for adventure, Frodo Baggins would always live in literally the same hole, meet the same people and not save the Middle-earth when the time has come. Even though he acted against his nature, he ventured into the unknown and, in the end, became victorious. Action: Whenever you feel you are looking over the borders of your comfort zone, put yourself in the most uncomfortable positions of all. ‘You can’t grow when you’re comfortable’ said Dave Anderson. #8 Embrace Your Leadership Role Aragorn had long avoided his rightful seat at the throne of Gondor, which made his existence the allegory of hide-and-seek. The circumstances finally forced him to act and, boy, did he embrace the leading role his destiny had assigned him. Being an entrepreneur means being in the thick of things. When it comes to your business, your dreams, your ideas, you have to take the lead. Moreover, you probably will have people around you who will be looking up to you. You will hire employees, who will need your direction. Learn how to be a motivational speaker because when the time comes when you will have to convince and an army of undead to follow you, you have to know what you are standing for. Conclusion J. R. R. Tolkien’s fiction continuously amazes readers all over the world with how intricate the details of each character are. The web of fantasy tale acts as a hot glue binding the realm of Middle-earth, but the world he weaved is intrinsically and universally life relatable. * The 25th of March is the date of the downfall of the Lord of the Rings (Sauron) and the fall of Barad-dûr. Can’t believe you did not know.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/8-entrepreneurial-lessons-Tolkien-taught-us-in-The-Lord-of-the-Rings-2020-600x400.jpg","March 24, 2017","en",0.990855097770691,0.0228625452728011,0.171948257833719,0.346606914070435,0.458582302555442

Aber sie sind nicht nur den ganzen Tag am arbeiten, sondern Familie und vor allem Freunde haben einen extrem hohen Stellenwert. Für beide ist der Freundeskreis ein wichtiger Nährboden für alle Ideen, Energie und auch Lebenslust. Sie sprechen oft mit Menschen die andere Meinungen vertreten um Ihre Denkweise zu verstehen und sachlicher an alle Diskussionen heranzutreten. Konstantin und Moritz diskutieren generell sehr viel. Konstantin spricht gerne mit vielen Menschen und sieht seine größte Chance in seiner Weiterentwicklung im Austausch mit anderen Menschen mit anderen Sichtweisen und kulturellen Hintergründen. Lobu vereint den Komfort des Online Shoppings mit dem des lokalen Einkaufens. Statt aus großen Lagerhallen weit entfernt wird aus Buchhandlungen in der Nähe des Konsumentens geliefert. Es wird noch am selben Tag mit dem Fahrrad ausgeliefert. Derzeit befindet sich das Projekt in einer Pilotphase im 18. Bezirk aber an der Weiterentwicklung wird schon fest gearbeitet. Was treibt Euch an? Konstantin: Ich glaube es ist enorm wichtig Dinge einfach anzupacken und zu machen. Ich möchte mir nicht nur Gedanken machen, sondern aktiv zum Positiven verändern. Ich habe nur ein Leben und ich möchte so viel bewegen wie nur irgendwie möglich. Wir sind die Generation, welche die nächsten 60 Jahre mit den Folgen der derzeitigen Entwicklung leben muss. Dazu zählt eine vollkommene Fehlentwicklung unserer Wirtschaft. Wir sind dabei unseren gesamten Einzelhandel einem großen Konzern zu überlassen und das ist ein Problem für die ganze Volkswirtschaft. So etwas führt zu dem Verlust von tausenden an Arbeitsplätzen und Steuerleistung, da viele Konzerne Ihre Steuern in anderen Ländern zahlen. Außerdem ist es umwelttechnisch sehr bedenklich Produkte quer durch Europa oder die Welt zu schicken, wenn sie schon in einer Stadt vorhanden sind. Was war vorher da? Die Liebe zu Büchern oder die Überlegung für ein regionales Lieferservice? Also die Liebe zu Büchern hatten wir schon als wir sehr klein waren. Damals wurde uns aus Büchern vorgelesen wurde und ab dem Zeitpunkt an dem wir selbst lesen konnten, haben wir Bücher regelrecht verschlungen. Habt Ihr ein besonderes Verhältnis zu gedruckten Büchern? Konstantin: Ich halte einfach gerne ein gedrucktes Buch in meiner Hand. Ich mag den Geruch und das Geräusch des Seitenblätterns. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Bücher in Eurem Leben ein? Konstantin: Ich lese sehr gerne und viel, da ein Buch die Möglichkeit bietet sich für einen kurzen Moment eine andere Realität zu erschaffen und in eine andere Welt abzutauchen. Leider bin ich in letzter Zeit kaum zum Lesen gekommen. Mit der Auslieferung mit dem Fahrrad beschreitet ihr einen sehr ökologischen Weg. Welche Rolle spielt Nachhaltigkeit bei Euch? Wir sind der Meinung, dass Nachhaltigkeit nicht nur ein Schlagwort für Unternehmen sein sollte, sondern tatsächlich aktiv ausgeübt werden muss. Gerade wir als junge Menschen müssen versuchen unseren Planeten wieder aufzubauen. Jeder der sich die Entwicklung der Welt ansieht, weiß dass es nicht ewig so weitergehen kann. Wir können nicht alle Ressourcen aufbrauchen und Waren nur aus preislichen Gründen einmal um die Welt schicken. Manchmal erscheint uns unser nicht nachhaltiges Leben auf Kürze günstiger, aber langfristig werden wir einen hohen Preis bezahlen. Wo seht Ihr Euch den nächsten Jahren? Gibt´s Expansionspläne? Auf jeden Fall! Unser erstes Ziel ist es Lobu auf alle Bezirke Wiens auszuweiten und einen übersichtlichen einfachen Webshop zu entwickeln. In weiterer Folge wollen wir mit Lobu auch in mehrere Städte expandieren, um so vielen Menschen wie möglich einen schnellen und fairen Service zu bieten. Gibt´s Vorbilder die Euch geprägt haben? Nicht wirklich. Wir haben uns immer eher auf die Sache konzentriert und versucht eigenständig und innovativ zu bleiben. Wenn wir aber doch Hilfe brauchen, holen wir uns gerne Rat bei Österreichischen Start-Ups wie “Whatchado” oder “Talentify”. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Eine große Hürde ist die Finanzierung. Des Weiteren ist es auch nicht immer ganz einfach Lobu mit den Schulzeiten zu vereinbaren. Seid ihr neugierige Menschen? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Sehr sogar. Moritz ist naturwissenschaftlich sehr interessiert und bastelt zum Beispiel derzeit mit Freunden an einem Prototyp eines neuartigen Mars-Roboters für einen Wettbewerb. Wir sind beide auch sehr neugierig, wenn es darum geht, andere Kulturen kennenzulernen und Abenteuer zu erleben. Aus diesem Grund haben wir beide auch mit dem ASSIST Programm ein Jahr in den USA verbracht. Was bedeutet Glück für Euch? Konstantin: Ich persönlich bin noch auf der Suche nach Glück aber ich erlebe Glück, wenn ich sehe, dass etwas, das ich mir ausgedacht habe, funktioniert. Aber ich glaube, dass es zwei Arten von Glück gibt – einerseits das mehr greifbare und der Erfolg mit Projekten und andererseits das emotionale Glück. Für mich sind meine Freunde unglaublich wichtig und Spaß zu haben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Eine Perspektive auf eine wirkliche Änderung darin wie der Einzelhandel funktioniert. Wir haben hier eine riesige Chance, um langfristig für eine positive Änderung in der Gesellschaft zu sorgen. Das müssen wir nützen und so sind wir auch nicht ersetzbar. Worauf verzichtest Ihr, um für Euer Start Up zu arbeiten? In erster Linie Schlaf. Und da man den dann doch manchmal braucht, muss auch das Lacrosse Training und die Fitnessstudio Besuche ein bisschen gekürzt werden. Außerdem versäumen wir jetzt wegen Terminen “leider” ab und zu den Unterricht. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Das tolle daran bei Lobu zu arbeiten ist, dass man in Kontakt mit so vielen verschiedenen interessanten Menschen kommt. Jeden Tag schreiben uns Menschen, denen das Projekt einfach gefällt und das ist dann wirklich sehr motivierend nachdem man so viel Arbeit investiert hat. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Der Hauptverband der österreichischen Buchhandlungen und die Buchhandlungen selbst. Sie sind begeistert von dem Projekt und ohne eine nachhaltige Kooperation mit ihnen hätte das Ganze auch keinen Sinn. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Wir beide ergänzen uns so gut, dass häufig nur eine Person niedergeschlagen ist, weil der Andere es dann doch schafft das positive zu sehen. So können wir uns gegenseitig unterstützen. Sonst sind unsere Familie und unsere Freunde immer für uns da und so haben wir jemanden, mit denen wir über Probleme reden können. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Geheime Projekte gibt es keine, aber wir haben natürlich Pläne dafür, wie wir unser Projekt vergrößern könnten <U+0001F609> Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Alle mit denen wir bis jetzt geredet haben, waren unserem Projekt gegenüber sehr positiv eingestellt. Wir haben auch tolles Feedback bekommen und schätzen und den Rückhalt den uns unser Umfeld gibt. Habt Ihr Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ta – Nehisi Coates und Glawinic Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Dass Lobu auch in 30 Jahren noch besteht und sich kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt hat. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Jede Buchhandlung ist ein toller Platz, um sich Inspiration zu holen. Das entdecken von neuen Schätzen und das schlichte auskosten der ruhigen Atmosphäre ist viel Wert in unserer hektischen Welt. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Mariam Al-Ayash von “Wiener Portraits”! Sie macht die besten Videos in der ganzen Stadt (und über die ganze Stadt).","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Konstantin-Klingler-Moritz-Stephan-Es-ist-enorm-wichtig-Dinge-einfach-anzupacken-und-zu-machen-600x400.png","March 28, 2017","de",0.998790204524994,0.0126288338069571,0.215431943535805,0.000730120853404514,0.771209061145782

Instead of throwing loads of books at you, we have decided to comb through our Netflix and AmazonPrime accounts to find the best documentaries for social entrepreneurs. We have found eight awesome films, including an Oscar winner. Throughout all the films you will see extraordinary heroes, social entrepreneurs who have made it to the big leagues, business people who are trying to create fair trade supply chains, and people who walk a mile in someone else’s shoes. And so, without further fanfare, here are our picks. Food Inc. From organic food giants to neighbourhood food movements, and from lobbyists to legislators this film has it all covered. Director Robert Kenner takes a close look at food – from policy, corporations, and entrepreneurs. Kenner weaves together multiple unconnected stories to create a varied tapestry with help from Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eKYyD14d_0 The True Cost Director Andrew Morgan approaches the fashion industry through the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013. The horrific tragedy is the impetus for his examination of the fast fashion problem. From environmental effects to human rights issues he does not shy away from any aspect of the sordid economic sector. Along the way you meet organic cotton farmers, a woman in India who is trying to make a life for her daughter, and several entrepreneurs trying to build better supply chains. Codegirl This one is simple – girls banding together to improve their communities and lives through technology. While computer science was undoubtedly founded by women (thank you Ada Lovelace, and all the amazing programmers, compilers, calculators, and codecrackers that came after her), the gender gap is widening within the employment segment. Watch this if you want to find out ways to create a more inclusive environment. The Startup Kids Two Icelandic entrepreneurs decide to travel the world to find inspiring stories of other start-ups and new, small businesses. The two women are in the tech business, more specifically gamification apps, and wanted to inspire others to pursue their passion and hopes to start their own businesses. Some of the biggest personalities in the cloud business are interviewed for this feature length film. Catching the Sun The film looks at the solar power industry – from dispelling myths to understanding the appeal of solar energy, as opposed to cheaper forms of clean energy. Naysayers and proponents alike are featured in the film, as the directors and producers hoped to provide a balance look at the industry. While the film features Americans heavily there are other entrepreneurs from around the world and their stories. The White Helmets This Oscar winning documentary short film follows those brave rescue workers on the front lines of the Syrian Civil Defence. Their day to day activities are captured well and the pace is fast, even for something this short. The run time is forty minutes but you will need some downtime once the credits have rolled as the film is quite intense. Living on One Dollar This documentary is made by a group of college students who try an experiment. They are going to, as closely, as possible mimic the conditions of those living in poverty in South America. They struggle through illness and hunger – living on one dollar a day. They meet their neighbours and learn how they have coped with some of the financial challenges they have faced. As well as entrepreneurs who are trying to make a better life for themselves and their families through micro-financing. Islands of the Future This is a documentary series featuring Europe’s coastal islands and how they are dealing with the oncoming energy crisis. Islanders use every eco-energy method available to them to power life on the island. There are five episodes total – so be prepared to binge watch. It is spring – there are bound to be some days of unpredictable weather. Hopefully, we have just given you something to do when it is rainy outside (or when you lack the inspiration to do anything).

It’s the idea that we have to go to this after work thing, dressed in a business or business-casual attire, sip on some kind of beverage and put our best attitude forward just so we can get noticed and create relationships out of thin air, connect with people we are not confident we can connect with, making sure we don’t miss an opportunity to be out there. But it doesn’t have to be like that. With the big Impact Hub Vienna 7th birthday’s celebrations looming on the horizon (it’s next week people! Details here ?) we thought we will help you out and teach you how to network with these 5 easy to implement tips on how to become a networking superstar. 1. Start the conversation The whole point of a networking event is to give attendees the opportunity to meet people that they would otherwise not get the chance to meet. Whether you are alone or attending with friends, business partners or colleagues, take the time to look around and introduce yourself to someone outside your familiar circle. Easy conversation starters like asking opinions on the organization of the event, remarks about the venue/food/drinks or simply complimenting someone’s choice of accessorizing are topics that can create a more relaxed environment and get people talking faster. 2. Be genuine Every networking event is frequented by smart, ambitious people that “hunt” for opportunities that only benefit themselves. It might seem that they get ahead in the short run, but in the long run, no one wants to work with or for someone who only thinks about themselves. If you want to create genuine relationships, don’t base your interactions solely on the thought of reciprocity. Smile, talk about your passions, identify what the other’s needs are and connect with them by trying to find a solution to their problem before you ask for something in return. Express your enjoyment, surprise or delight of meeting someone, only if you genuinely feel like the time spent together has provided you with those sentiments. People can generally feel and notice- whether consciously or not- when others are insincere and with networking you always want to aim for creating a positive impression. 3. Don’t be a snob for titles We’ve all been there: you need to make a fast sale or are looking for a new job, so it seems imperative you talk to “the person in charge”. However, a lot of people forget that an organization is not just run by one single person and that there is a connectivity that happens at all levels of the company. So don’t dismiss someone just because you find his or her title is unimpressive. Instead, try to see what the person you are conversing with has to offer. 4. Have a plan Planning ahead is generally a good application to life itself. Going with the flow might be an effective attitude if you are not sure where you want to end up, but when you want to reach a goal, having a plan or a structured idea can help you save time, avoid misunderstandings and uncomfortable situations. Knowing what you need to get out of the events you are attending is just as important as knowing what you can offer. If you get the chance, look up the people who will be attending ahead of time and structure your presentation accordingly. 5. Follow up To get the most out of an event, follow up quickly. After the event, the hype and adrenaline of meeting so many people and listening to tons of pitches and stories tends to decrease -on some level we have already satisfied our need of connection and sharing, so most ideas and plans that were discussed remain just that- ideas and plans. However, people that do follow up on their contacts and persist in creating outcomes after the event are the ones that successfully and efficiently use the resources that were put at their disposition to stand out from the masses and actually generate the results a networking event is aiming for.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/03/let-them-eat-cake-birthday-cake/","ImpactHub","Let them Eat Cake – Birthday Cake","Get your party pants on because we are serving up birthday cake. In honour of Impact Hub Vienna’s seventh birthday we made a delicious baked confection to share with you all, in the form of a recipe, because we ate it all. After waffling (baking pun intended) about how we should approach the recipe we opted to make a vegan cake. There are many reasons that we went with this option. First, and foremost, because Impact Hub Vienna is an inclusive group, we wanted everyone to be able to share in the celebration. Second, we wanted to adopt some of the principles of sustainable eating, one of which is eating fewer animal products. And third, we just thought it would taste super fantastic. Making the Cake We don’t often cook on the Impact Hub Vienna blog, let alone bake. So, this is relatively new territory for us. One of us (namely me), has been watching far too much Great British Bake Off and so volunteered to take on the task of making the cake. Which also meant finding the recipe and adapting it. After scouring the internet, and my shelves of cookbooks, I learned that there was a bit of a formula to vegan cakes. And so, we mashed a bunch of recipes together and created a brand new one – just for you. We gathered all the ingredients together – and you can find all of them quite easily, in this case, your local grocery store. As we went for a coconut flavour, we used coconut milk in the cake – which has a high proportion of natural fats. However, you can substitute this for one cup of any vegan milk with a half a cup of oil of your choice (coconut, walnut, whatever). Keeping in mind that this will affect the flavour of your cake – so chocolate soy milk and almond oil will taste a bit different than, say, hazelnut milk and hazelnut oil. You really ought to use a smaller tin for this cake – 22 cm is the ideal size. owever, if you do not happen to have a 22cm circular tin around your kitchen, then improvise. Like we did. We used a tin with a hole in the middle because it decreased the total surface area that the cake would have to cover, which meant it worked out just fine. Now that we have the basics covered – ready, get set, BAKE. The Good Stuff Without further ado, here is the recipe that we cooked up for you. We adapted this from Thug Kitchen’s first cookbook Thug Kitchen: Eat Like You Give a F*ck – The Official Cookbook. These are also non-metric measurements – so you may need to do some conversions if you do not have measuring cups. Ingredients: 2 cups spelt flour, with extra to dust the tin ¾ cup sugar (you can get organic and fair trade sugar – but I used what I had in the house which was from a local sugar refinery). 2 tsp baking powder ½ tsp salt 1 ½ cup canned coconut milk 1 tsp vanilla paste ½ tsp grated ginger Fun coloured sprinkles (optional, but it is a birthday cake, so you need to make it look festive) coconut oil, for greasing the tin Method Preheat your oven to 190° Grease and flour your tin using a vegan oil – we used fair trade coconut oil. Spread oil all over the tin and then dust flour on the tin; turn the tin to evenly distribute the flour. Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and ginger in a mixing bowl. Using a wire whisk, mix all the dry ingredients together (or use a sieve if you are a disciple of baking properly). Add the rest of the ingredients and mix with a spoon, wire whisk, or electric mixer until it creates a smooth batter – be careful not to over work otherwise your cake will not rise well. Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes – but check your cake often. It is ready when you stab it with a sharp implement of some sort and it comes out clean. Let the cake cool for a while in the tin – at least 15 minutes. Then turn out onto a rack to cool a little further. DO NOT put icing on the cake until it is completely cool. Some of us learned that lesson the hard way. Put sprinkles on the frosted cake. Cut and serve to friends and family who decided that cake was enough of a reason to celebrate with you – regardless of the occasion. We frosted the cake using a standard sugar and water icing and some sprinkles – because every cake needs some sprinkles. However, you can use coconut whipping cream to frost this cake or decorate with fresh fruit. There are so many options. #gallery-0 { margin: auto; } #gallery-0 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 49%; } #gallery-0 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-0 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } $(document).ready(function() { /* * Simple image gallery.

With the anniversary just around the corner, here are seven good reasons to celebrate with us. 1. Members The Hub wouldn’t exist without me, you and your fellow members. Therefore, let’s celebrate each other and how great it is to simply be part of the Hub. Don’t be a stranger. Share your stories and get advice from members who are all wonderful people, each with great insight, ambition, and experience. View the list of Impact Hub Vienna members here. 2. Support Support goes a long way to success. Nobody who ever made it, made it there alone—everyone received some help along the way. At the Hub, there aren’t just support programs for your entrepreneurial needs, there’s also the fantastic people you meet every day who support you and your ideas to change the world. If you need any help, just ask. 3. Iss mich! Can’t forget about the iss mich bistro at the Hub itself! We all rely on their coffee to fuel us throughout the day. Besides serving great coffee, iss mich uses high quality fresh produce, that does not meet retail standards due to aesthetics, to create delicious vegetarian dishes. The food is always amazing and eating from one of their jars reduces both food and plastic waste. 4. Events There’s almost always something going on at the Hub and the events are great opportunities to learn, engage, and connect with others. From Sexy Salad Tuesdays to Yoga, to skillshare breakfasts to dancing, to community cooking to internal and external events that can help your business; every day is another opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. With the birthday party promosing big turnout, make sure you attend it to reap the benefits. Scared of networking. Read our guide on becoming a networking superstar. 5. The Hosts The Hub would be nothing without the wonderful hosts who take care of everyone and are key to the running of the Hub itself. Without them, the Hub wouldn’t be what it is today. Let’s celebrate them for their dedicated hard work! 6. Vienna Let’s not just celebrate the Hub, let’s also celebrate the wonderful city that it’s in. Vienna is consistently voted one of the best places in the world to live. There are so many wonderful things to see and do. Check out the museums, eat at the restaurants, and marvel at the stunning architecture. So let’s take a moment and celebrate how lucky we are to live here. 7. Family The Hub is a family—a family of social entrepreneurs working together trying to make a difference in the world. We should celebrate that fact because you don’t find that just anywhere. With open hearts and open minds, we want to make the world a better place. It’s a beautiful thing. Join the party! April 6th, 2017 from 16:00 – 21:30 at the Hub.

The 7th birthday of our Hub is tomorrow so a look back at the timeline of Impact Hub Vienna moments was inevitable. We sifted through the memorable events, turning points in the history of our Impact Hub and lots of photos. And they were all awesome. How to pick only seven of them to celebrate the 7 years cycle of Impact Hub Vienna’s existence? We gave this almost impossible task to IHV co-founder and director, Matthias Reisinger. Here are his best seven moments of Impact Hub Vienna! #1 2010: Opening of Impact Hub Vienna with Muhammad Yunus #2 2010 Hosting the Social Entrepreneurship Seminar at the European Forum Alpbach In August 2015 Impact Hub Vienna welcomed the Social Entrepreneurship Seminar at the European Forum Alpbach, an interdisciplinary platform for science, politics, business and culture established in 1945. The seminar explored the concept, idea and phenomenon of social entrepreneurship with particular focus on its form and relevance in the Central European context and on gaining insights into the personal lifecycle and development path of social entrepreneurs. Check out the photos from this event on our Facebook page here, here and here. #3 2013 Merger of IHV and IHV Incubation Center + Implementation of Holacracy Since September 2013, Impact Hub Vienna employs a holacratic structure of governance after a long quest for the right organizational structure. Alexis Eremia, co-founder of the Impact Hub Vienna shares her perspective on the process: “I’ve been passionate and concerned with leadership and organisational development for over 12 years, to realise that most of the theories can not thrive without a radical shift in structure. Holacracy is the only system I found that creates engagement and authority equally balanced with self-accountability. It is fascinating to observe the insecurity people feel once they realise the leader is not there anymore. It opens up a space for learning. Few months later in the process, the organisation looks completely different. The system just functions, independent of specific individuals, independent of changes.” (Source: Can Holocracy improve your social venture?, published on the Impact Hub Vienna blog on 24th February 2014) #4 2013 Organising Design for Impact + Hosting the Global Impact Hub Gathering On October 15 2013, 300 impact practitioners from all over the world gathered in MAK in Vienna, to look at best case practices of systems transformations and distill principles of “design for impact”.

View more photos on our Facebook page.#5 2015 Opening of Second Space The Impact Hub Vienna acquired the ground floor of the building at Lindegasse 56 in 2015 and expanded by 1200m²! It’s incredible to think that once the Hub lived only on that second floor of Lindegasse 56 behind the code protected doors. But the community grew and grew, and soon it became evident the Hub needed to expand to make all the amazing people comfortable. Take a trip back in time and read this official announcement of Impact Hub Vienna growing in size posted on the 16th of March 2015, which also includes vidoes of what the ground floor used to look like. #6 2016 Being in Forbes Magazine among the top 20 incubators world-wide#7 2017 Number one in Member Survey responses for the second year in a row In other words: you crushed it! Thank you for taking part in the survey and helping Impact Hub Vienna become better and better every year. Celebrate with us! Join us this Thursday at 4pm to kick off birthday festivities.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/06/break-the-ice-at-a-party/","ImpactHub","How to break the ice at a party","Sure, the chance to connect, collaborate and be part of a community of super interesting like-minded people, and get to learn from and be inspired by them is what drives you to come to work at Impact Hub Vienna. As opposed to working from home alone and in your pyjamas. This is true for most of the people who choose to work in coworking spaces, and also the reason why people thrive in such places as said on Harvard Business Review. But how to get to know all these amazing people? Come to the party and talk to them! And P!NK’s famous song goes: “Makin’ my connection as I enter the room Everybody’s chillin’ as I set up the groove Pumpin’ up the volume with this brand new beat Everybody’s dancin’ and their dancin’ for me I’m your operator, you can call anytime I’ll be your connection to the party line” But what if I don’t know how to break the ice at a party? Let’s face it, how comfortable are you in approaching strangers in a party? Or even going to a party for the sake of mingling with people you don’t know? If you are like me, your answer is probably “not so much.” But you know you want to! Here is a hack to beat awkwardness, get out of your comfort zone, and win at this week’s party, and every social event that follows: The Dinner Party Download podcast. “Dinner Party Download is an hour-long celebration of culture, food and conversation designed to help you dazzle your friends at this weekend’s get-together. In every episode, you’ll learn a joke, bone up on an odd bit of history and then wash it down with a themed cocktail. Plus, unconventional wisdom from hosts Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam.” Since the first time I listened to the Dinner Party Download, a couple of years ago, I have become a devotee and a huge advocate of the show. The podcast is structured in segments like a real dinner party. Although an hour-long, it feels much shorter, as it is always witty and fast-paced. To get things started, there is an Icebreaker, a celebrity tells a short and embarrassingly cheesy joke. Then there is the Small Talk, which is a piece of quirky news that most probably has been overlooked, while we were paying attention to the headlines. Followed by Cocktails (A History Lesson with Booze), where the hosts tell us “something fascinating that happened this week in history” then they invite a bartender to create a drink inspired by the historical event. My favourite segments of the show are The Guest of Honor and Etiquette. There is always a Guest of Honor, a super entertaining, informal, in-depth and, sadly, super short interview with one of the world’s top filmmakers, actors, writers, artists or musicians. The last episode they talked with film director Danny Boyle about his most recent movie, T2 Trainspotting. In this same episode, they invited no one less than drag queen- superstar-diva, Ru Paul, to answer Etiquette questions, submitted by listeners. Questions are usually on how to behave politely in awkward situations. Sr. Ian McKellen , Gandalf himself, has answered these burning questions on the show before. The result is a mix of good advice and big laughs. In short, with its blend of pop cultural current events, food trends and alcohol, this show has everything you need to win your next dinner party. I hope you take advantage of my secret weapon and come prepared to have some great conversation and connect with all the amazing people that will be at our party. Check it out! You can start by listening to my favourite episode of all times! Join the party! April 6th, 2017 from 16:00 – 21:30 at the Hub. There will be a fun recap of the last 7 years, great food and drinks from iss mich, Brotpiloten and Vollpension, live music, and a Members’ market where you can buy products and services and support your fellow members!

However it looks like the IT team didn’t properly erase the data on it. Curiously the following is the only thing they left. I could not find any Mark Thomson currently at the company so I attach the message to you. Kind regards, Pete. From: Mark Thomson Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 18 February 2017 at 09:07:29 GMT+1 To: Tara Harris Hey, I’m sorry for this long delay. I had a crazy couple of months and I did not have time to keep to our agreement. I’m loaded with thoughts and certain sensation of hopelessness. I hope this message will not be a drag on your days… but isn’t that the reason why we decided to write instead of talk in the first place? Go, get a cup of coffee, sit down, open your umbrella and get ready to get wet under my dark grey cloud. There are so many stories, events, opportunities, trainings programs. So many options for me to feel as if I still need to do more in order to finally become successful. I tried it all, and in the end I would always find myself in the same place: without money and struggling. I just don’t know anymore if trying to do something meaningful, walking the difficult path is worth the effort. I don’t even know what is the purpose of all of this. The only thing I know is that I need money in order to move forward. You know, I am aware I should feel grateful because I live in a country full of opportunities with access to all the basics and blah blah blah. However, I do not feel that way because everything is so freaking difficult anyway. If I get a job I can last a month but I will feel forced; If I go the startup way, I’ll have to work very hard and, most likely than not, I’ll not earn enough money either. Yes I know, I’m trapped in a pessimistic whirlpool. I’m ready for your rainbow <U+0001F642> — From: Tara Harris Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 18 February 2017 at 13:21:43 GMT+1 To: Mark Thomson You are not the only one lagging in our correspondence. My seeds of success were sown a few months ago and I started to see some of them growing. I dedicated myself to “water” them to see if they would grow any faster. In the meantime my daytime job is paying the bills. I made some time to enjoy a couple of days hiking with Tom. They were amazing. You know, I understand how you feel. Isn’t almost everybody in the same situation? I gave up the idea of becoming the best architect ever; that rat race is futile. I just decided to be extremely pragmatic, realistic and manage to free enough time to enjoy my weekends to the fullest. I don’t care if my dad thinks I wasted my architecture degree and my mom thinks I’m getting too old to get pregnant. I got a job to pay the bills and have my weekends free. I dedicate a few hours per week to keep illustrating, which makes me forget the world around me. And you know what? A friend of a friend just asked me to illustrate her new phantasy book! She is also just starting so she offered me a small payment – I’ll use it to surprise Tom one of these days. — From: Mark Thomson Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 19 February 2017 at 01:17:11 GMT+1 To: Tara Harris Yup, I must keep it simple and focused and I need to reward my efforts with enjoyable weekends. I was thinking to build an aquaponics system to support my organic production of herbs. Sounds as a great weekend project, doesn’t it? If I understand correctly, you are trying to tell me that instead of focusing on what I need to improve I should pay attention to what is possible at the moment? And when you say that you gave up your career as an architect, you mean you changed your expectations of an amazing professional future for the satisfaction of keep illustrating without the pressures of a traditional job? Aren’t you afraid of staying with your current small job, and never achieving your potential and economic success? — From: Tara Harris Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 19 February 2017 at 16:23:28 GMT+1 To: Mark Thomson Well yes, it worries me a bit. I’ve heard that if I don’t try to strive for the top, I will never get there. But if everybody else is trying to do the same is there going to be enough space for all of us at the top? Is ‘the top’ the only place to arrive at in order to enjoy a normal life? Although I never thought to work as an assistant for a small logistics company, I’m doing a good job and maybe I’ll even get a promotion. It’s the kind of potential I wasn’t even considering. My art happens when I’m at peace at home and I truly hope it manages to inspire others in unexpected ways. At the end of the day what is your full potential? Isn’t it the unexpected result of a life with meaning?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/12/nonviolent-communication-improve-interactions-others/","ImpactHub","Nonviolent Communication: Improve your interactions with others","We always tend to think we’re good communicators and believe it’s someone else that’s the problem. It’s something we think we’ve mastered and that’s why we’re often confused when it blows up in our face. How many times have you stood there scratching your head, bewildered about what just happened? More than enough is my guess. And you know what you can’t afford when relying on working with other people as an entrepreneur? Being misunderstood. It’s counterproductive, expensive (time is also a valuable currency) and frustrating for you and your team members. This is where Nonviolent Communication (NVC), also known as Compassionate Communication, comes in. Developed by Marshall Rosenberg, an American psychologist, NVC provides a framework to understand each others’ needs and promotes a way of using language to improve how we talk to one another. It has been successfully applied all over the world in a variety of areas including education, mediation, and organizational and business settings. What is Nonviolent Communication? NVC works under the theory that we all share the same needs and conflicts arise when we miscommunicate and fail to address the needs of others. It advocates the use of positive language and that we be non-judgmental and empathetic towards others. The goal is to communicate compassionately, to find out what people’s needs are and to work together to satisfy the needs of all involved. There are 4 components to NVC. In brief, these are: Observation: We observe only the facts of what was said and try not to apply meaning or significance. Feelings: What we are feeling in the moment. Expressing these feelings can help resolve conflicts and misunderstandings. Needs: We all have needs. Our lives and what we do and say are in service to those needs. Request: After observing and recognizing feelings and needs non-judgmentally, we request an action that is not a demand using clear and positive language. Watch ‘Vulnerable honesty’ by Yoram Mosenzon, a Certified Trainer in NVC, at TEDxAmsterdamED NVC can be quite different to how we typically communicate with one another. The primary thing to keep in mind about NVC is that it’s about compassionate communication through a connection with yourself and others, while trying to express yourself honestly. The ultimate goal is to communicate better. If you want to implement NVC in your own life or in an organization, know that there will be a transition period and it’s something that takes practice like any skill or sport. Very few of us, if any, get it right on the first go. Just remember, practice makes perfect. Where to learn more about NVC? To find out more about NVC, check out The Center for Nonviolent Communication. You can also read the book Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by theman himself, Marshall Rosenberg. To connect with the local NVC community, find seminars or workshops, check out Gewaltfreie Kommunikation Austria. Want to know more about Impact Hub?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/13/sharing-economy-impact-hub-members-leading-charge/","ImpactHub","Sharing Economy: The Impact Hub members leading the charge","You’ve probably heard about the more popular examples of the sharing economy such as Uber and Airbnb. You’ve probably used those services just like I have. But what is the sharing economy? The definition of it is fairly broad but basically, it’s the peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services through an online marketplace. Access instead of ownership. You don’t always need to drive a car so why own one if you can simply pay for one or borrow one when you need it? At Impact Hub Vienna, we have a few members that we’d like to shine a spotlight on who are leading the way in the local sharing economy. FragNebenan FragNebenan is a social network for urban neighbourhoods. It’s a place for neighbours to connect and share knowledge, resources, organise mutual aid, or they can just chat about local issues. FragNebenan also empowers neighbours to organize and interact with property managers, community initiatives and local authorities. Its goal is to help remove some of the anonymity of living in a city, lower the barriers between neighbours, and get people who live near each other to connect. They’ve also got a great blog that highlights and discusses certain issues that tend to come about when people live next to each other in a community. hey! The Sharing Community hey! Vienna is a local sharing community where people can offer products for rent and services for hire. You can rent bikes for a weekend outing in the countryside, a GoPro to record it, or if you don’t want to organize any of these things yourself, you can sign up for a bike tour instead. If you’re in the mood for it, you can hire a personal trainer, a photographer, and you can even take a basket-weaving workshop. Skillshare Breakfast Skillshare Breakfast is a monthly mini-workshop event series hosted by and for members of Impact Hub Vienna, aiming to provide a platform for skill-exchange among the members of the community on a crowdsourced (bring-your-own-breakfast) basis. It is a great way to meet inspiring members, learn some new skills and even share your skills. For more info on the upcoming Skillshare Breakfasts get in touch with Alex [[email protected]].

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/19/impactful-summer-holidays/","ImpactHub","Impactful Summer Holidays","Spring will shortly give way to summer, which means that I start thinking about planning my summer holidays. My options are apparently endless. There are the sun-drenched beaches throughout the Mediterranean, taking in the lengthy days in Scandinavia, or hiking in the Alps. However, there is a new question to add to my usual holiday booking checklist. Can I have an impactful summer holiday – to feel good and to do good? Perrine, at Shades Tours, inspired me to go looking at the various cities in which I wanted to vacation. Her post for Vienna includes a whole range of options like shopping at a local upcycling boutique to cake at an intergenerational café. Need a place to stay? Perrine has that covered too, a hotel that employs refugees. Using Perrine’s criteria, I spend time looking on the internet to see what I can find in the places that I most want to visit. And because I know that I am not the only one looking for this information, we put together a tool kit to help you book your own impactful holiday adventures, no matter where you end up. Where to stay Socially responsible hotels take many forms – they can employ refugees like Vienna’s own Hotel Magdas, they can be environmentally friendly, they can spearhead charities looking to decrease poverty or hunger. There are dozens of lists available on the internet with responsible hotels, our favourite was Make Time to See the World (it was also the longest and most complete). However, a quick internet search for any city can pull up numerous hotels based on your criteria. Like boutique Ibsens Hotel in Copenhagen where you can pay in ArtMoney or Hotel Park in Split that started a recycled soap factory that employs disabled persons. Or, you can tap into the sharing economy. Airbnb is a popular website for booking apartments, rooms, or bed and breakfasts in any city. Where to eat Finding restaurants and bakeries that meet dietary needs and preferences, as well as provide sustainable food and are socially responsible is a herculean task – even on the internet. However, keep an eye out for local businesses. Generally, there are always a few vegetarian and vegan restaurants in every city. Sometimes, you run into a few gems, like The Social Bite that provides jobs and meals to the homeless in Edinburgh. You can choose to buy a meal for a homeless person by just doubling your tab. Dans Le Noir in Paris offers dining and spa experiences in the dark, to provide the guest with a small notion of what it is like to be blind. Their guides are all blind and all product ambassadors across Europe. Or take cooking classes from local schools and institutions. Most small course providers offer market tours along with the cooking class, giving you an idea of the flavour of local cuisine and allowing you to cook with a larger group and eat with people that you have never met before. Where to Shop This is completely dependent on what you wish to purchase. If you are looking for trousers in Amsterdam, I would suggest the eco-friendly and socially responsible Denham, with three boutiques in the Nine Streets. If you are looking for clothing and accessories in London, then head to People Tree, necessary for every socially responsible fashionista. There is another opportunity to support local businesses. Look for craftspeople and locally made items that you cannot find anywhere else. Don’t skip on freshmarket experience- where else the true colours and aroma of the city reside if not at the fruit and veg open markets? Research, which ones are the real deal with local people, local produce and the unparallaled atmosphere of truly getting to know a place through local cuisine. What to do There are always art galleries and museums in every major city as well as a bevy of iconic sites. But are there other things to do? Of course, there are! You just need to look. Take a street art walking tour in Paris. Find all the comic book murals in Brussels. Take a running tour in Amsterdam. Walking tours are always a good bet – not only are you getting an intimate view of the city with a local tour guide you are also saving carbon emissions and doing something positive for your health. Check out the extensive network of Free Walking Tours here, here, and here. They are guided by qualified tour guides, who share their favourite spots in the city together with captivating stories from the past. The tours operate on pay-as-much-as-you-want basis. Set yourself up for a spot of “tree bathing”, the new trend, in any city. Parks, hiking trails, and cemeteries offer tree lined and contemplative spaces. No matter where you decide to go – there will always be options. All it takes is a modicum of planning and using your already keen sense of social responsibility.

It’s by your side all the time. Your life, social and professional, is in this device. A day without it makes you feel disoriented and lost. It’s that important. But have you ever thought about how your smartphone is made? What’s in a smartphone? From the minerals that are necessary for the components to the working conditions of those who assemble the phone, the production of smartphones is fraught with conflict. Essential minerals for smartphones such as gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten are sometimes sourced from parts of the world that have extremely poor labor conditions for workers. The purchase of these minerals, depending on the area from where they are sourced, may also help provide financial support to serious conflicts. The entire supply chain of smartphone production from beginning to end contains a minefield of serious issues that many major manufacturers choose to ignore. But there’s one company out there looking to change all that. Fairphone Fairphone is a social enterprise company based in Amsterdam whose mission is to develop, design, and produce socially responsible smartphones. From the supply chain through to production, their goal is to ethically source the materials necessary for production while also ensuring that labor conditions are fair. While they acknowledge that it is not yet possible to produce a 100% fair phone, their goal to do so has the aim to raise awareness among consumers and the mobile phone industry about the issues that they face. Alongside their achievement of sourcing conflict-free tin and tantalum, Fairphone has managed to build the first-ever Fairtrade gold supply chain in the consumer electronics industry. They operate with a commitment to transparency and you can find things such as a list of their suppliers as well as an explanation as to how they decided to pick their production partners on their website. The phone itself The latest phone from Fairphone is the Fairphone 2. It is the first modular smartphone available for consumers and it is designed for a longer than average lifespan of 5 years. The modular nature of the phone allows for parts to be easily replaced by the user extending the lifespan of the phone, reducing the need to replace the entire device thereby reducing the user’s environmental impact on the planet. So if you’re in the market for a new phone and are looking to support a company that supports social change, look into a Fairphone. Impact Hub Want to know more about Impact Hub?

Which means that inspiration can come from being curled up on your couch watching your favourite movie with a bowl of popcorn. So, we have curated a list of the nine best movies for entrepreneurs. The Intern Anne Hathaway plays an internet start-up leader with a growing company and brand. Robert DeNiro plays an unassuming retired phone book executive (you read that right). With nothing to do at home, as retirement has stripped him of his social and intellectual identity, he takes a “senior intern” opportunity at the expanding start up. You absolutely will love the opening sequence of the film. The trials and tribulations of being a woman in a leadership role and having to balance life and work are examined lightheartedly in some cases and with great emotion in others. Sunshine Cleaning Company Well, cleaning up crime scenes sounds like a good way to make money and that is what these two sisters, played by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt find out. They struggle with unknown regulations, certifications, and relationship issues along the way. Alan Arkin plays their quirky father with his own entrepreneurial bent – which is often misdirected. This quirky comedy will have you cheering for the one-armed man. The Pursuit of Happyness Starring Will Smith as Christopher Gardner, a single dad in harshly impoverished circumstances trying to create a better life for himself and his son. The film follows Gardner through his flagging sales career, the dissolution of his marriage, his eviction, and homelessness with his son in tow, attaining a coveted unpaid internship, and later his triumphant achievement of a full-time position as a stock broker. This film will give you the inspiration to persevere against any challenge to achieve your goal. Moneyball Brad Pitt stars in this film that shows the usefulness of data to achieve glory. Pitt’s character, Billy Beane, uses an unconventional approach to scouting prospective players for the Oakland Athletics – data. In the sport that covets statistics more than anything else it seemed that, until recently, teams were built on instinct. The difficulties of getting this new methodology accepted and tracked is at the hear of the film, as well as the successes of various teams who have adopted it. This film is necessary for any entrepreneur who is breaking new ground. Office Space Sometimes we must define things by negation to truly understand them. That is what Office Space gives the entrepreneur. Following the antics of Peter Gibbons at Initech the film is a biting satire of life in a large corporation – from cover pages on reports to issues with the printer. This film will make you thankful that you do not work in a traditional cube farm. Joy Joy Mangano, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is the inventor of the self-drying mop. The idea strikes her after cutting her hands by wringing out a mop filled with broken glass. The film follows the trials and tribulations of bringing a new product to market. Joy’s personal and professional lives intertwine to create a tale of treachery and deceit in business. Sometimes, you need to know when to learn from the mistakes of others instead of making them yourself. The Angel’s Share The socially conscious director Ken Loach brings us the story of a troubled young man who has recently become a father. Robbie’s life is fraught with violence and the addition of his partner and son have only created new difficulties. The entrepreneurial spirit of this young man mean theft and reselling stolen goods at the beginning. He still manages to get himself straightened out in the end and lands his dream job working for a whiskey distillery without the threat of violence in his hometown. While these films do not all show the happy side of entrepreneurship, they do provide plenty of inspiration to persevere against all challenges.So, for the next movie night choose one of these and feel productive while eating your giant bowl of popcorn.

No, really – we mean visiting multiple countries and getting a taste of their culture without travelling beyond the borders of our beautiful city. Don’t believe us? Let’s talk about a colourful initiative by Impact Hub Vienna members, Route28. Route28 is a one-day event happening on the 6th of May at Museumsquartier, which offers the Vienna’s residents an opportunity to travel across the continent in creative and ingenious ways, right in their own backyard. By choosing one of the seven creative routes you get to experience Europe’s feeling in an entirely different way: compete in a Dutch “slow-biking” competition, make Polish pierogi, participate in an Irish pub quiz, celebrate a Swedish birthday complete with Pippi Longstocking, and many others. Europe is a feeling Created by Katharina Moser and her colleagues at the creative agency MOSAIK, Route28 helps people get excited about being European. They are convinced that ‘a personal experience increases the interest in another country and personal contact strengthens empathy’ (source). This is especially important given the wave of populism that has swept through the world and makes us feel disconnected from our nearest neighbours. Moser and her team wanted to highlight that differences between countries do exist – but that this diversity is rather a source of mutual inspiration, exchange and fun instead of fear or distance. ©Luiza PuiuCreating connections via Route28 What links Belgium, Ireland, and the Czech Republic? That is easy – they are all collaborators. A travel guide will take you to several countries that are linked in new and interesting ways. What about aperitifs and small talk in France, a cooking course in Poland, and a poetry slam in Germany? While participating in exciting activities, the travellers will get to know not such well-known aspects of different cultures and immerse themselves in authentic experiences. Each station will be staffed with people coming from the countries you will be visiting at the event, which connects further and removes the stigma of unexplored lands through personal contact. ©Sascha Osaka Where: Route28 kicks off at the MuseumsQuartier at 1 pm on May 6. You can find all the details on the official Route28 website. What: There will be an opening concert in the courtyard and then the travellers are on their way. There are 15 stations along seven travel routes, there is even one for the younger travellers. The event is in German and also a great event for the whole family. Register for Route28 here. Be quick, spaces are limited!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/02/david-witzeneder/","ImpactHub","David Witzeneder: “Ein einfaches und zufriedenes Leben mit einer spannenden Arbeit hat Qualität.”","David Witzeneder blickt gerne auf seine glückliche Kindheit am Land zurück. Nach der Ausbildung zum Techniker in einer HTL wollte David die Welt bereisen und lebte anschließend in Lettland und Costa Rica. Das war für Ihn eine sehr wichtige Zeit. Mindestens genauso wichtig ist bis heute das Meditieren um fokussiert zu bleiben. David ist Imker und lebt in Andorf (OÖ) sowie Wien. In den stylischen Wurmkisten aus Holz leben Kompostwürmer welche geruch- und geräuschlos Biomüll in wertvollen Wurmkompost umwandeln. So eine Kiste kann man in die Küche stellen und als fahrbaren Hocker verwenden. Dort fressen sie den gesamten Biomüll. Was treibt Dich im Leben an? Spaß an der Arbeit, Herausforderungen und ein einfaches Leben. Wann hast Du genau dieses Projekt entdeckt? Es hat alles damals angefangen wie ich nach Wien gezogen bin zum Studieren. Ich war entsetzt von der Tatsache, dass Biomüll in den Restmüll landet. Mir ist es wichtig in kleinen Kreisläufen zu arbeiten wie es auch in der Biolandwirtschaft im Optimalfall praktiziert wird und da war mir einfach der Biomüll im Restmüll ein Dorn im Auge. Durch einen Mittagsschlaf bin ich dann auf eine Wurmkiste gekommen. Die Idee gibt es schon seit über 25 Jahren doch ich habe sie für mich neu entdeckt und war voll begeistert. Es dauerte keine Woche und die erste Wurmkiste war gebaut <U+0001F642> Wieviel Leidenschaft und persönlicher Begeisterung steckt in der Wurmkiste? Es ist mein Baby. Das ist natürlich auf der einen Seite gut, weil man viel Leidenschaft und Liebe hineinsteckt. Jedoch manchmal kann es auch zu viel werden. Des Öfteren ist es dann präsent beim Essen mit der Familie, beim Fortgehen mit Freunden und in meinem Kopf. Da ist es wichtig auch Abstand zu bekommen. Sport und Ausflüge zu machen. Ein unausgeglichener Geist kann nicht fokussiert arbeiten. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser bzw. Grund gegeben? Biomüll im Restmüll zu akzeptieren ist eine moralische Frage. Er gehört einfach dort nicht hin und Menschen die eine Wurmkiste haben sind auch begeistert von ihren neuen Haustieren. Bei mir kam anschließend die Erkenntnis, dass ich weiß wie man Wurmkisten baut, wie man gesunde Würmer sicherstellen kann und wie man es optimal präsentiert damit die Menschen lange eine Freude daran haben. Auf einmal war ich “Wurmkisten David” und bin auch happy darüber. Die Wurmkiste ist ja auch Teil von Kreislaufwirtschaft. Wie wichtig ist dieses Thema für den urbanen Raum? Der urbane Raum bekommt praktisch alle Ressourcen von außen. Autarkie gibt es keine. Ob bei den Lebensmittel, Energie oder Wasser. Da wird es natürlich immer wichtiger unabhängige Kreisläufe zu bilden. Dass Wien alle Lebensmittel nicht selbst produzieren wird ist mir schon klar. Doch in Havanna klappt es ganz gut. Eine andere Motivation steckt bei den Kubanern dahinter aber technisch wäre es möglich und das ist wichtig. Was sind denn das so die größten Ängste, Zweifel die dir begegnen? “Stinkt das nicht?” ist wahrscheinlich Frage Nummer 1 gefolgt von “Stell dir vor alle Würmer kommen raus und sind in der Küche”. Bei beidem kann ich Entwarnung geben <U+0001F642> Wie schauen mögliche Entwicklungsstufen aus? Wie schauen deine nächsten Schritte aus? Ich bin derzeit im Prozess hineinzufühlen was optimal für uns ist. Auf der einen Seite möchten wir das Thema Wurmkompostierung Menschen näherbringen, was Wachstum bedeutet und anderseits möchten wir nicht in diese marktüblichen Abhängigkeiten fallen wie Kredite, Verkaufsprognosen für die nächsten 5 Jahren einhalten zu müssen, eine Werbeagentur beauftragen,… . Wahrscheinlich wird es ein Spagat werden müssen. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Es ist an sich ganz spannend doch interessieren mich das Arbeiten mit Holz und das Züchten von Würmern mehr als Bücher zu LEAN-Start-Ups zu lesen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Stylische Wurmkisten die auch als Sitzhocker funktionieren <U+0001F642> Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Meistens in der Nacht, wenn ich alleine in der Werkstatt bin und an neuen Prototypen bauen kann, Versuche mit dem Wurmkompost anstelle oder mit Ideen herumspiele. Das ganze Gepiepes und Geblinke untertags, wenn Mails zum Beantworten sind und Fragen auftauchen lässt keinen Raum für die Leidenschaft. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Oftmals auf das Treffen mit Freunden oder einen gemütlichen Abend mit meiner Freundin. Es hält sich alles jedoch im Rahmen. Was mir auch viel Zeit erspart und mir eigentlich gar nicht abgeht ist Alkohol zu trinken. Sonntag Früh ist eine gute Zeit. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste ist natürlich schwierig herauszupicken. An einem ökologisch sinnvollen Produkt zu arbeiten und die immense Lernkurve die ich seit dem Start erfahren habe sind die beiden schönsten Aspekte meiner Arbeit. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Ganz klar meine Freunde. Ich bin sehr dankbar dafür. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? In den Kompostwürmern steckt so viel Potential um gleich mehrere ökologische Probleme unserer Zeit zu lösen und irgendwie fühle ich mich bereit mit ihnen gemeinsam ihre “Talente” für die Umwelt zu nutzen. Würmer können nicht nur Biomüll zu hochwertigen Humus umwandeln, sondern auch kontaminierte Böden reinigen. In diese Richtung wird es auch gehen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Themen zu begeistern? Das Potential der Würmer begeistert an sich schon. Wenn jeder Mensch 1000 Würmer in einer Wurmkiste hätte gebe es keinen Biomüll mehr und alleine diese Idee fasziniert schon mal. Und außerdem sind es feine pflegeleichte Haustiere. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden es ganz gut und fiebern richtig mit. Falls mal Not am Mann ist helfen sie auch gerne mal mit und das zeigt, dass sie auch begeistert sind. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Eine ¼ h Spazieren in der Früh und ein paar ruhige Minuten sollten sich immer ausgehen im Tagesablauf einzubauen. Der Tag gewinnt immens an Qualität. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Dass viel mehr Menschen ihre Leidenschaft entdecken und diese auch leben. Es wäre zu schade Geld und Verpflichtungen nachzulaufen. Ein einfaches zufriedenes Leben mit einer spannenden Arbeit hat Qualität <U+0001F642> Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …?

Sie kommt aus Salzburg und lebt seit 2003 in Wien. Während eines Europäischen Freiwilligendienst in Madrid entdeckte sie ihre Liebe zu Europa in all seinen Unterschieden. 2009 veröffentlichte sie während ihres Studiums in Wien das Buch „Servus, Bussi und Baba – und was Europäer sonst noch ‚typisch österreichisch’ finden“. Nach Stops beim Österreichischen Außenministerium, dem British Council London und dem Europäischen Forum Alpbach, wagte sie sich 2015 ans Unternehmertum und gründete ihre eigene Agentur MOSAIK: Der Name steht für viele einzelnen Teile, die ein großes Ganzes bilden – so wie Europa. MOSAIK setzt sich mit unkonventionellen Produkten und Projekten für eine positive europäische Identität ein. Nach dem Storytelling-Kartenspiel zu Europa KOMM ZU MIR!, arbeitet sie aktuell an dem Großevent “Route28 – die Europareise mitten in Wien”, das am 6. Mai 2017 in Wien stattfinden wird und Europa für einen Tag in die Stadt holt. Nebenbei schreibt Katharina Artikel und Kolumnen für unterschiedliche Zeitungen. Die Agentur “MOSAIK – European Communication Projects” wurde 2015 gegründet und entwickelt Produkte und Projekte, die eine europäische Identität stärken sollen. Beim Storytelling-Kartenspiel zu Europa KOMM ZU MIR! hat man mit skurrilen Fun Facts zu europäischen Ländern Spaß an Europa. (Aktuell auf Deutsch, Englisch und Französisch erhältlich). Neben Route28, sind Projekte, die in Kooperation mit MOSAIK entstanden, die Motivationsbroschüre für Jugendliche in Europa “Who, if not us?” oder die Deutsch-Lernplakate für Flüchtlinge Wallpaperforrefugees. Was treibt Dich im Leben an? Die große Freude, Dinge zusammen zu bringen, die sonst in dieser Konstellation nicht zusammen wären und die gemeinsam etwas Neues ergeben. Mit motivierten und inspirierenden Menschen arbeiten zu können und gemeinsam etwas zu kreieren. Und eine Art Grundvertrauen ins Leben und die Menschen. Wann hast Du genau dieses Projekt für Dich entdeckt? Beim Mittagessen mit einem Freund vor gut zwei Jahren. Er hatte mitbekommen, dass ich mich schon lange mit dem Thema Europa beschäftige und wir haben uns gefragt, warum wir uns eigentlich europäisch fühlen und was das ausmacht. Die Antworten waren sehr persönlich. Da geht es um Erlebnisse, Geschichten, Menschen. Darum, dass man im Ausland gelebt hat, auf Reisen war, sich verliebt hat, andere Sprachen gelernt hat, sich in der Fremde zurechtfinden musste. Daraus ist die Idee entstanden, dieses Erlebnis auch Menschen zugänglich zu machen, die nicht so viel unterwegs sind – indem man die Reise in ihre eigene Stadt bringt. Das war der Anfang von Route28. Warum ist es MOSAIK geworden? MOSAIK hat mir irgendwie unter den Nägeln gebrannt. Es war und ist mein Versuch mein Leben kreativer und eigenständiger gestalten zu können und meine Zeit und Energie in Projekte zu investieren, die für mich – und hoffentlich auch andere – sinnstiftend sind. Was fasziniert dich denn so an Europa? Ich war schon immer angetan von der Idee, dass viele kleine Elemente, die an sich sehr unterschiedlich sind, gemeinsam ein stimmiges Ganzes ergeben können. So sehe ich Europa auch. Was mich an Europa daher schon immer fasziniert hat, waren die Unterschiede. Schon allein in Wien braucht man ja nur ein, zwei Stunden fahren und schon ist man in komplett unterschiedlichen Ländern, Sprachräumen, Kulturen. Wenn Du Europa hörst, was sind da so Deine Gedanken, was kommt Dir da in den Sinn? Viel. Am besten lässt es sich wohl zusammenfassen mit dem Motto der Europäischen Union – auch wenn es mir wichtig ist, zu betonen, dass ich mit meiner Arbeit nicht die EU erklären oder promoten möchte, sondern die ihr zugrunde liegende Basis der europäischen Identität stärken will. Aber ja, “Vereint in der Vielfalt”, trifft es in dem Fall am besten. Gibt´s für Dich einen typisch europäischen Platz in Europa? Ich glaube, Europa liegt so viel näher als wir immer glauben. Ich schreibe regelmäßig über Spuren europäischer Länder in Wien. Und in den meisten Fällen muss man nicht lang suchen. Sei es die venezianische Tapas-Bar mit dem herzlichsten italienischen Besitzer, eine urige polnische Spelunke mitten im 15. oder die Pub-Quizzes in einem der unzähligen Irish-Pubs. Europa liegt weniger an einem Ort, als in unserem Blick, den wir dafür öffnen müssen. Erzähl uns Deine drei ganz persönlichen Wünsche für Europa? Mehr Interesse aneinander. Mehr Empathie füreinander. Mehr Kooperationsbereitschaft miteinander. Wie schauen so die nächsten Schritte mit MOSAIK aus? Am Samstag, dem 6. Mai stellen wir die Route28 – Die Europareise mitten in Wien zum ersten Mal in dieser Dimension auf und wollen unseren TeilnehmerInnen die Möglichkeit geben an insgesamt 15 Länder-Stationen europäische Länder hautnah zu erleben. Du bist ja mit Deiner Initiative im Impact Hub angesiedelt. Was fasziniert Dich so an der Arbeit im Hub? Der Hub ist nicht nur Arbeitsplatz, sondern auch Support-Netzwerk und inzwischen sogar Freundeskreis geworden. Es gibt jede Menge Menschen im Hub, die mich inspiriert, motiviert oder unterstützt haben. Und auch ich teile meine wachsende Erfahrung immer gern mit den vielen kreativen und engagierten “Hubbern”. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Oh ja! Wozu sind wir auf der Welt, wenn nicht dazu, sie kennenzulernen, sie uns anzusehen, möglichst viel über sie zu erfahren? Zwei Dinge, auf die ich immer neugierig bin, sind Menschen und neue Orte. Ich mag es, mich in unterschiedlichen Kreisen zu bewegen und finde das Gespräch mit einer Klasse 15-Jähriger Berufsschüler genauso spannend wie ein Abendessen mit hochrangigen Politikern. Und neue Orte erfüllen mich selbst in Wien immer mit einem Anflug von Lebendigkeit – wenn ich durch unbekannte Straßen gehe oder Lokale besuche, in denen ich vorher noch nicht war. Dann ist mein Puzzle der Welt wieder um ein Stück reicher. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Die Route28? Das werde ich unsere TeilnehmerInnen am 6. Mai fragen und hoffe, dass ihre Antwort sein wird “Ein einzigartiger und unvergesslicher Tag in meinem Leben, an dem ich Europa tatsächlich ein Stück weiter näher kommen konnte.” Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Dort, wo ich Menschen finde, die meine Leidenschaft mit mir teilen und sie mit mir gemeinsam umsetzen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf das gute Gefühl, Freitag abends das Büro zu verlassen und in den wohlverdienten Entspannungsmodus umzuschalten. Im Moment antworte ich, wenn mich Leute fragen, wie es mir geht, meist damit, wie es der Route28 geht. Aber ich weiß, dass es im Leben unterschiedliche Phasen gibt und diese intensiven Arbeitsphasen auch etwas ganz Spezielles und Energetisierendes haben. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Menschen. Beispielsweise mein Kernteam, mit dem ich im Moment die meiste Zeit verbringe und die mich zumindest zu Mittag von meinem Laptop wegscheuchen. Die unglaublich tolle Erfahrung, mit Menschen, die man einfach richtig gern mag, wirklich produktiv zu sein und dabei auch noch Spaß zu haben. Der Gedanke mit dem, was man tut, andere Menschen zu erreichen und ihnen etwas mitgeben zu können. Und die Menschen, die über die Zeit dazu kommen, und uns in dieser Vision unterstützen. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Ich wiederhole mich, aber: die Menschen. Jede und jeder einzelne aus meinem Kernteam, der und die sich über alle gängigen Arbeitsvereinbarungen hinaus für dieses Projekt engagieren, weil sie selbst daran glauben und ein Teil davon geworden sind. Und die vielen Menschen, die uns dabei helfen, wie zum Beispiel die rund 50 Leute in unserem “Circle of Friends”, die uns am 6. Mai als Guides, Stationsbetreuer und Event Angels zur Seite stehen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Ich habe eine Handvoll an Menschen, die mich schon lange begleiten und meinen Kern ganz gut kennen. Die sind zwar von Sydney bis London verstreut, aber wenn ich um 3:00 Uhr in der Früh nicht mehr weiter weiß, gibt es dennoch Nummern, die ich anrufen kann. Das ist wohl eines der wertvollsten “Güter”, die man haben kann – gerade als Unternehmer, wo man im Tagesrhythmus mit Herausforderungen konfrontiert ist. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Irgendwann wird sie mich wohl nach Europa bringen. Im Moment hab ich ja den blöden “Fehler” begangen, dass ich mir Europa nach Wien geholt habe. Aber eigentlich hätte ich schon Lust wieder mehr zu reisen, herumzukommen, eben, mir die Welt anzuschauen – und letztlich auch die Route28 hoffentlich in andere europäische Städte zu bringen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Themen zu begeistern? Die Frage der Motivation ist für mich eine der schwierigsten und ich habe oft Angst mit dem, was ich tue, allein zu bleiben. Was ich aber glaube, ist, dass Begeisterung begeistert. Und Authentizität. Darum versuche ich ehrlich mit dem umzugehen, was mich bewegt und freue mich über jeden, der einen Teil des Weges mit mir gehen will. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Ich würde sagen, dass ich ein sehr unterstützendes Umfeld habe. Das Wissen darum, dass Menschen an einen glauben, ist sicher eine der größten Energiequellen, die man im Leben haben kann. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Na klar, schaut am Samstag, 6. Mai bei der Route28 – Die Europareise mitten in Wien vorbei! Gratis einen Tag lang europäische Länder in Wien erleben, gibt es so schnell nicht wieder. Es gibt noch Plätze unter www.route28.eu Hast Du einen Wunsch? Dass wir am Samstag, 6. Mai um 13:00 Uhr vor einem mit TeilnehmerInnen vollen MuseumsQuartier Hof stehen und ich nicht vor lauter Nervosität vergesse, ihnen eine schöne Reise zu wünschen. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Eine Empfehlung in eigener Sache ist die Broschüre “Who, if not us?”, die ich gemeinsam mit elf anderen jungen Europäern geschrieben habe und die im Juni auf deutsch im Knaur Verlag erscheint. Und ein Buch, das vielleicht nie an Aktualität verliert, ist Stefan Zweigs “Die Welt von gestern”. Ja, ich glaube, das kann man gerade heute wieder empfehlen. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Jemand, deren Worte, Ideen und Taten guttun und inspirieren, sind die einer der wortgewandtesten Frauen, die ich kenne und die ich glücklicherweise zu meinen engsten Freundinnen zählen darf: Lena Raubaum.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/05/supporting-social-entrepreneurs-sustainable-eating/","ImpactHub","Supporting Social Entrepreneurs: Sustainable Eating","As social entrepreneurs we have a certain responsibility to the world. We need to lead the change and take charge of educating ourselves before we strive to make a social impact. This is why we all should look down and inspect the contents of our plates. Everywhere I look these days it seems that there is a new documentary or a book on sustainable eating. Everyone is telling me that I can look good, feel good, and do good just by eating. Despite all this information, I still had no real idea how to eat sustainably. Is sustainable eating vegan? Organic? Local? Farm to table? Gardening? When confronted with the myriad of options in the grocery store how do you make the best choices? Do you buy organic avocados from Spain? What about tinned kaferbohnen from Styria? Does fresh pork loin from Radatz count as sustainable eating? Do you, as a thriving entrepreneur, take time to examine how a box of out of season strawberries impact the world around you? What is eating sustainably? At its very core, sustainable agriculture means production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare (Source: Sustainable Table). This means that everything that lands on your plate is healthier, environmentally friendlier and created without compromising our ability to produce food in the future. Sustainable eating is supporting conscious food production by buying products – meat, eggs, cheese, dairy, vegetables, etc. in a responsible fashion. Meaning less food waste, more locally grown organic food, less packaging and educating yourself constantly about your actual impact. Dan Barber and Michael Pollan each present a working sustainable farm. For Dan Barber, a high-end New York chef and restaurateur, it is his family farm Blue Hills in upstate New York. Barber and his staff serve up creative and seasonal dishes from all the produce on the farm – and this includes the animals as well. Pollan, in The Omnivore’s Dilemma, presents Polyface Farm where the everything operates in a nutrient loop; the cows graze in the field, returning valuable nutrients to the soil, chickens remove pests and insects that cause crop failure and spread cow manure, later when the field is planted the crops grow better in the nutrient rich soil. This also means planting crops that are not monocultures, that are indigenous or grow best in the conditions, and using fewer pesticides and chemical fertilisers. Now, in both examples animals are part of the farm. This is because these organisms work together in nature. The most sustainable form of agriculture replicates the systems found in nature. If you think of a forest there are plants and animals and all of them work together to make a healthy ecosystem. That is what sustainable producers do on their farms. How to eat sustainably? So, sustainable eating means purchasing and making food that comes from these systems, farms, and producers. And this means educating yourself about what you find in the grocery store, markets, or anywhere else you shop for food. Obviously, the easiest way to do that is to speak with people. Strike up a conversation with the person selling your apples – find out what orchard they are from, who grew them, and how they farm. Gardening is also a very sustainable way to eat. You know exactly what you put in your window boxes, your allotment plot, or your share of the community garden. And you can ask yourself all sorts of questions about the herbs, cherry tomatoes, and gem lettuces that you are growing. If you do not think that your three pots of an indoor garden are enough, try building a living wall or a wall farm. There is a cool European manufacturer of indoor gardens called Click and Grow. Check out their website to see if their smartphone connected planters and wall farms are right for you. Eating more plants is good for you and good for the environment. In fact, prioritizing plants in your daily eating is a big part sustainable eating. Plants take less time and resources to grow than meat, eggs, and dairy. Other options for eating more sustainably are to: choose food with less packaging prioritize local products choose imported foods only when you know the people and the network involved choose foods that would normally have been wasted Will you be able to eat a perfectly sustainable meal each time you sit at your table? At first, no. It will take time to build the network and resources that are necessary to eat sustainably. Will it get easier over time? Yes, it will. Why does sustainable eating matter to entrepreneurs? That is a simple answer to a simple question. While you are out shopping and asking questions, you are helping entrepreneurs and local producers. You are helping local coffee importers bring in coffee from their family farms and local mushroom growers expand their market. So, let’s help each other out and use the ready-made network that we created here at Impact Hub Vienna to eat sustainably. You can learn how to prepare a sustainable meal by attending one of our weekly Tuesday events, Sexy Salad, which invites all Hubbers to bring their leftovers or fresh food and prepare a healthy meal together in the community kitchen. Check out our ‘Events’ section for more details. Who works in sustainable food? We found some businesses in Impact Hub that deal in sustainable food. Find out more about them and get inspired to make your journey towards sustainable eating easier! Iss Mich: makes delicious dishes from food that would have otherwise been wasted – like ugly carrots and misshapen apples. Check them out at Impact Hub Vienna. Hut & Stiel: grows mushrooms in coffee grounds from other local businesses. They are grown in the Vienna area and you would be surprised how many restaurants serve their tasty mushrooms. Lunzers: works with local suppliers and producers to sell food with reusable packaging. They have created a network of growers that you can tap into and start on your sustainable journey.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/08/leadership-style-making/","ImpactHub","Authentic Leadership – a style in the making?","Leaders! We read about them, we hear about them, we are influenced by them. Our wishes and expectations for them may differ heavily, but this doesn’t stop them from writing history. In recent years, the importance of being authentic as a leader is being constantly emphasized. But what does being an authentic leader really mean? We all have our different ideas on how an ideal leader should look like. These ideas are mostly based on our own psychological needs, character traits and skills. If we have high levels of anxiety, for example, we may feel the need to have a charismatic and authoritarian leader, who would provide some sense of security. Feeling a bit more confident may result in a wish to have a leader, who boats more humble approach, which in turn enables a rather collaborative environment. Even if these ideas contrast with each other, they are all shaped by our perceptions of the world we live in and by the life experiences we have made so far. Different leadership styles will meet different needs and they all come with their own benefits and disadvantages. How do these life experiences and perceptions occur? By taking chances! When we take in our life experiences and let our intuition guide us through them, we get in touch with our core-self. The more we experience and make mistakes, the more we find out about ourselves and what we really want in life. In this process, some of us will realize, that they too, want to take the matter into their hands and become leaders. By letting their intuition guide them, they will also be able to find their own authentic leadership style. However, authentic leadership is much more than just a style. It is based on a person’s character, it is based on the person as a whole. It may not make you the best leader, but it will enable you to stay true to yourself and honor the person you are meant to be in this life. At the Impact Hub Vienna, we feel lucky to have some of the most proactive and influential leaders as our members, who are striving to change our community for the better.This is why we decided to dedicate time to explore their experiences and learn from them together. In this upcoming series of articles, we will seek the answer to the question of how did our leaders at Impact Hub Vienna find their unique leadership style.

Take internet searching. Whatever the question, we first turn towards search engines to serve us multiple answers in milliseconds. Little do we know that searching does not go unnoticed in our environment. Have you ever wondered how much power and resources are required to serve the massive data centres of Google, Yahoo, Bing or other tech companies? For example, Google, the main ‘culprit’, which only last year hosted over 92% or world searches, entered ‘water wars’ last month when its thirst for 1.5 million gallons of water needed to cool down the servers was reported in a newspaper. Realistically we can’t unplug and start visiting libraries when in doubt, but does it mean that there is no green alternative to technology, which revolutionised our lives and made them (let’s say it out loud) tremendously more convenient? Luckily there is Ecosia. How Ecosia works Ecosia is an internet search company based in Berlin, which donates at least 80% of its surplus search ad profit (income after costs) to support tree planting initiatives around the world. It started in December 2009 and received a B Corporation status five years later, making it one of the 1600 companies around the world to meet the rigorous standards of sustainability, accountability and transparency by non-profit B Lab. Holding true to their words, in December 2016 Ecosia donated €137,000 which was 49% of its total income. €12,000 went to The Masarang Foundation in Indonesia, €15,000 went to The Eden Projects in Madagascar, and €110,000 went to Ecosia’s Tree Planting Fund, which is money that the company’s tree-planting partners do not currently need. The funds are reserved solely for tree planting initiatives and will be released when there is enough planting capacity. Due to Ecosia’s commitment to transparency, all this information is openly available on their website. You can read their monthly financial reports and tree planting receipts and follow their goal to finance the planting of 1 billion trees by 2020. Much needed alternative As one reads online about Ecosia, voices of scepticism appear here and there, challenging the view that bringing yet another search engine can be counterproductive to our goals of saving the environment. Yet, the prevailing opinion is that having a green alternative to internet search, a tool which we will definitely not give up easily, is a confident step towards igniting a sense of personal responsibility in socially conscious internet users. Despite Ecosia being way too far from offsetting the effect of 15 billion trees cut down each year, there is no debating that before Ecosia, there wasn’t any other alternative to Google that would be so dedicated to environmental causes. What can you do? If you want to contribute, it’s really simple. Switch completely or partially to searching on Ecosia. When you click on an ad or purchase something online, the company earns revenue. To use Ecosia on your phone, you can install the Ecosia App on your iPhone or Android. You can also add the Ecosia extension in your Chrome or Firefox browser. If this sounds like something you want to support, start searching and help plant trees! Impact Hub Want to receive updates when a new Impact Hub Vienna article is up?

Yet not every startup or entrepreneur uses this platform for marketing purposes to its full potential. With its recent features, such as carousel posts available to everybody and Instagram Stories, marketers are creating great content and getting great results. With over 400 Million people using Instagram worldwide on a daily basis, 70 percent of Instagrammers follow a business profile on Instagram. Taking under consideration that: over 150 Million Instagrammers use stories every day, over 500K advertisers use Instagram stories to drive business results and 75 percent of Instagram users take action inspired by a post, I do not know why you haven’t recorded your first Boomerang video yet. With this post we will give you a couple of tips on how to use Instagram to boost your marketing efforts and making the most of the platform. Keep on reading! Set up a business profile If you haven’t switched to a business profile on Instagram, do it now. All business profiles are granted access to Instagram analytics, can post to Facebook Business Page, and based on the contact information you included, can show easy access buttons for telephone, e-mail and directions to your store on your profile. This mean you can monitor how effective Instagram is in your content marketing strategy and if it is bringing you the results you anticipated. In addition, while business profile is not a requirement for creating Instagram ads via Facebook Ad Manager, having one gives the people you advertise to an opportunity to find out more about you without leaving the platform – Facebook adverts for brands, which do not have a profile on Instagram, do not have a clickable username leading to a profile page, which sometimes discourages users from seeking out information on the brand. Advertise on Instagram Instagram helps over 8 Million businesses reach their corporate goals. There are over 1 Million active advertisers each month, resulting in 80% increase in followers on Instagram for advertising accounts. Creating an ad on Instagram is very straightforward, fast, and easily done in just four clicks. And if your brand is targeting millennial consumer segment, then Instagram is the way to go. A study conducted by Pew Research Center revealed that 18-29 years old represent the highest demographic of Instagram, accounting for 59%. Source: Based on data from Pew Research Center, 2017 Photo ads Tell your brand story with beautiful, high resolution photos in square or landscape format. You do not even need a professional camera and equipment for quality pictures – all you need is your smartphone and a good light, the rest can be done with Instagram’s additional apps such as Layout and Boomerang – these features offer possibilities to post pictures and videos in different formats and try out something new every time. For example, Storets is a Korean online fashion company that attracted new customers through Instagram and Facebook photo ads promoting its unique fashionable designs. The company aimed its marketing efforts towards women aged between 20-34 worldwide. The campaign successfully achieved 48% increase in unique visitors, and increase sales by 4x as compared to their previous campaigns. Carousel ads This feature can combine up to add 10 photos and videos in just one post, allowing you to tell a story in a compelling way. Carousel ads enables the audience to view ads and swipe left to see more images, click on the link to a website for further information or a Shop now button that directly drives users from Instagram to your app or landing page. This creative feature lets you share your business experience from behind the scenes to a step by step tutorials showcasinng your product or service. Video Ads Using Instagram videos to display your products, ideas, and services is a great way to combine the power of sight, sound, and motion.Make sure you optimise the ad for muted viewing – add subtitles or text, which will encourage your audience to tap on the ad and listen to it. Diplom-Is is a Norwegian ice-cream company that used Instagram video ads to launch its six new flavours targeted at millennials. This well-recognized, yet a small-business company in Norway, reached out to six influencers and entertainers for the ad campaign. The influencers posted live videos on Instagram during the making of ads, which created a buzz even before the campaign officially rolled out. The series of Instagram video ads increased the brand awareness by 53%, ad recall by 34%, and generated 634,000 video views. Dynamic Ads Instagram recently launched dynamic ads which enables brands to market their products to the audience, who have browsed your website or mobile app. In other words, custom audiences. Several e-commerce and retailer businesses have used them to increase conversion rate and lower their cost per acquisition across each device. MeUndies, an underwear and loungewear brand, had success in increasing sales of its product line during Black Friday and Cyber Monday by using dynamic ads to retarget audience that had visited their website but not purchased. This resulted in 5x return on ad spend, 25% decrease in cost per purchase on Instagram, and 30% decrease in cost per add-to-cart action on Instagram. Stream live videos and tell stories Another excellent feature on Instagram, which you can use to connect with your audience, is Instagram Stories. Stories is an ephemeral video function, meaning that once you post the story it will disappear after 24 hours. In addition to that there is Instagram Live streaming option, great for showing how to videos, Q&A or just for checking in with your audience. Why you should be exploring Insta Stories? Because this year video content will represent 74% of all internet traffic (Source). What moreover, Instagram Stories give you the rare opportunity to share valuable content with your audience, run short promotions, publish content, which otherwise does not fit with your account’s style and show the backstage of your start up. Market Land revealed that “15 to 25 percent of the people who see a link in an Instagram Story are swiping on it, according to a handful of brands and publishers that have been experimenting with the feature.” The head of Digital Marketing of Mulberry said: “We’ve been early adopters of Instagram Stories and were impressed by the reach and engagement. Our recent campaigns which included a stories link, received 5x more clicks to site and engagement when compared to the average seen across our other social channels” UGC aka turning your audience into brand advocates In the past brand advocacy could not be measured as easily as it is today. By encouraging users to tag you and hashtag their photos of you/your product with a dedicated hashtag, you create plenty of free PR, which can be recycled to leverage your reputation even further. Ever heard of UGC, which stands for user generated content? You can both appreciate your faithful followers by featuring them on your accounts and also show other viewers that your brand is worth trusting and values its customers. With 88% of people trusting online reviews written by other consumers as much as they trust recommendations from personal contacts (BrightLocal), an Instagram post is nothing else but a visual representation of somebody endorsing your brand. Ask your customers to use your branded hashtag to easily find them and make sure your username is easily connected with your brand. You can also feature a fan of the month, repost users’ photos or create a graphic with your customer’s testimonial. Want to stay updated with Impact Hub Vienna?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/17/spotlight-wge-gemeinsam-wohnen/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen","WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen is establishing a model of shared multigenerational living in Vienna. They arrange and supervise shared living between elderly and young people enhancing mutual activities and support while keeping the rent lower than the market average. Their services include a platform for single and institutional clients. Marlene Welzl is in charge of Communications, Sales & Marketing for WGE! We chatted about how it all started, some of the difficulties the organisation has faced along the way, and the vision they have for the future. How did WGE! start? Marlene: It started with the idea of bringing young and old people together. We felt that there was a growing lack of interaction between generations so we wanted to create something that would foster intergenerational dialogue and solidarity leading to mutual learning and understanding. In order to put this idea into action, we identified some socioeconomic issues affecting the young and the elderly and thought about a possible solution. Young people from all over Austria and other countries move to Vienna to study–there are around 200,000 students here and they face rapidly increasing rent prices. At the same time, there are also elderly people who might need some help with daily activities or who just enjoy company, who live in big apartments and have a free room to offer. We put two and two together and WGE! was born. What brought WGE! to Impact Hub Vienna? WGE! started arranging mixed generation housing 18 months ago and we’ve gotten to a point where we feel that we’re ready to develop the organisation further. We applied for this year’s RE: Wien development program and were selected which is great because it gives us the opportunity to get different perspectives, to develop and improve our business model, to explore different sales and marketing strategies while also allowing us to tap into the existing Impact Hub community with all their talent and experience. We love the environment here. How do you find the RE: Wien development program so far? What does that mean for your organisation? The program is great! We’re in the third month and we’re all extremely excited. So far, we’ve taken part in acceleration workshops and have received business coaching. It’s also given us the opportunity to connect and collaborate with other start-ups. We’re a small team of 6 people and we all feel that we’re getting the support and the outside input that we need for WGE! to grow further. It’s just such a wonderful opportunity for the organisation.The program lasts for 6 months so it’s a set period of time and that means the next months will be an intensive period of development for WGE! By the end, we’ll be closer to if not exactly where we want to be. It’s a great incentive that’s motivating the entire team. Can you tell us about some of your successful projects? One of our clients is a 75- year old woman who lives in the 8th district on the third floor of an apartment building with no elevator. Managing her day-to-day-life became increasingly challenging, so her son got in touch with us to help find a suitable roommate for his mother. We matched her with a 30-year old young professional who is now happily living with her and helping her with her day-to-day needs. There is also a 55-year old single mother who works in Prague during the week. She lives in a big house in the 23rd district with her 16-year old daughter. While the daughter is fully capable of taking care of herself, the mother felt that she needed an older sister-like figure from a different cultural background so that there would be someone at home for the daughter to have conversations, breakfast and dinner with as well as have an intercultural experience. We arranged for a 22-year old student from Armenia who is studying English to move in with the family. There’s one more that I’d really like to share because he’s a really cool guy! He’s a retired professor of architecture in his early 60’s who has a 200 square meter apartment in the 4th district. He is now sharing his flat with three other students. It’s great because he enjoys being surrounded by young people and the students benefit from his professional and life experience. Everyone is very happy with their respective arrangements. Has WGE! experienced any major challenges? It took us some time to understand the needs of some of our clients, particularly the elderly, and the fact that every client has a unique situation. In order to address these issues, we are continually redesigning and evolving our services to provide better support for our clients. Developing the proper legal framework for our clients was also a significant obstacle to overcome. Finding the correct balance that benefits both parties while providing adequate security was a bit tricky. There is also understandably a greater demand for rooms as there are rooms available. This is the main challenge that we continue to face: finding open-minded people who are willing to offer a room. For some people who do have rooms, they are hesitant to allow a stranger to live with them, which we can understand. But we continue to push our message and try to find open-minded people because we believe, and from the feedback we’ve received from our clients, that this experience is worthwhile and enriching for all involved. For people who might be interested in joining WGE!, what are some of the benefits? The benefits for people using our services is actually everything beyond the living arrangement that we facilitate–it’s the environment and the experiences that are created when people from different generations spend time doing activities together and learn from one another. We help create this opportunity but it’s the people that create the magic that can only exist between them. Think about the retired professor of architecture that I mentioned before. He has a lot of knowledge and experience in his field and one of his roommates is studying architecture. She is learning a lot from him while she is helping him with IT. Another benefit of WGE!, especially for young people, are the lower rental costs. For example, WGE! is able to offer a 20 square meter room for less than €300 (all costs included) in the 3rd district. This is almost impossible to find otherwise. What would you like to see WGE! become? Our goal is for WGE! to become a sustainable social business that offers a viable alternative to the traditional housing market. Our long-term goal is to take our platform to the next level: everybody who is looking for a roommate, whether they just want some company or need some help in their daily life, can find the right roommate, and where everyone looking for a room can find comfortable and cosy rooms, regardless of their financial situation. It won’t matter whether you’re a private person or an institution looking for the perfect match. Through this process, we hope to create new communities who support and benefit from each other. What effect do you see WGE! having on Vienna and/or society at large? Our hope is that we create the opportunity for a greater understanding between generations. Our service is also designed to transform unoccupied living space into occupied living space, helping to reduce the need for new living space. Our hope is that this helps create a more sustainable housing market. We also would like to prolong the time that elderly people can live in their homes while also lowering the rental costs for young professionals and students. How can Impact Hub Vienna members help WGE!? Ask your parents or grandparents whether they would be interested in joining! While we are currently more focused on intergenerational housing, we understand that there are other living situations that merit our services as well. So if you happen to have a room and are interested in what we do, please let us know! Want to stay updated with Impact Hub Vienna?

We’re not just watching, we’re binge-watching. That’s how good TV is nowadays. It’s so good, you’re probably watching a TV show right now as you’re reading this. Hopefully, they’ll be one of the following 5 great TV shows for entrepreneurs. Halt and Catch Fire This show is a fictional retelling of the development of personal computer and the growth of the internet. It tells the story of Joe MacMillan, an ex-IBM executive who tries to reverse-engineer the company’s technology for his new firm, Cardiff Electric. Greed and ego affect all those involved as they try to give the giant of the computer industry some healthy competition. The Wire A seminal piece of television that over its five seasons gave a stunning portrait of the city of Baltimore. Learn how to deal with the law, politicians, and how to expand your empire. Yes, the empire in the show revolves around the business of drugs and crime but the lessons aren’t that dissimilar. Business is business, and it can be unforgiving. Silicon Valley Start-ups are all the rage and Silicon Valley clearly depicts all the absurdity and the surrealism that can be found in the start-up world. From the creator of the classic “Office Space”, which I remember seeing on its opening weekend in an empty theatre, Mike Judge turns his comedic focus onto the tech scene to show it in all its crazy glory. Black Mirror A great show, a compelling show, and a horrifying show of a very plausible future. A show that is great for the social entrepreneur because it clearly illustrates some of the ideas that we’re probably better off not pursuing. Whether it’s the ability to record your every experience or the social rating of you, the implications and consequences of these ideas are explored in fascinating ways. Every episode is self-contained so feel free to jump in whenever. Girlboss The newest show on this list, Girlboss is loosely based on the autobiography of Sophia Amoruso, who went from an eBay store selling vintage clothes to founder of Nasty Gal, a clothing retailer that at its peak was valued at $200 million. And she did it all before the age of 30! As much a lesson of what to do as it is of what not to do if you want to succeed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-U2G280kmI And there you have it.

This is about technology done right. Too Good To Go You have probably heard of dumpster diving – collecting free fresh food that is thrown away daily by supermarkets – but what would you think if I told you there is a way to enjoy a great meal at a bargain price? „Too Good To Go“ makes this possible. Just like dumpster diving, the aim of this app is to help the environment and reduce food waste by enabling restaurants to sell their surplus food in eco-friendly takeaway boxes just before the restaurant closes. Download the app to see which restaurants are participating in Vienna or anywhere else your travels may take you. ProDeaf Mobile As the name suggests, The ProDeaf Mobile app is here to make communication easier between the deaf and hearing. The app provides you with instant translations from Portuguese to Brazilian Sign Language, or from English to American Sign Language. FiveApp Like the ProDeaf Mobile, FiveApp is also aims to support the Deaf community by providing a messenger that suits their needs. The Five CEO, Mateusz Mach, designed the app with the help of a group of freelance coders. At the beginning, Five was an app that lets you send custom hand signs and gestures to your friends, just like rappers do! With constructive feedback from the Deaf community and the cash influx from various venture capital firms, Mach was able to turn the app into something that has great social value.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/06/impact-investment-rodney-schwartz-interview/","ImpactHub","Impact Investment- A Rodney Schwartz Interview","“Impact Investment is on the rise”, says Justin Fox in a Harvard Business Review article from September 2014. And according to the report on Impact Investment Trends carried out by thegiin.org, with numbers and data as recent as December 2016, Justin Fox was right! But what exactly is impact investing? Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to not only generate financial return but also a visible social or environmental impact. On June 22nd and 23rd, Impact Hub Vienna will host the CEE Impact Day. A conference that brings together Impact Investment players to inspire, connect and enrich the impact ecosystem within Central & Eastern Europe. Rodney Schwartz, an impact investment expert and the CEO of the UK based company ClearlySo, will not only be a speaker at the CEE Impact Day, he will also host a masterclass and be part of the panel. I had the pleasure to chat with Rod on a few of the impact investment topics and here are his thoughts on the matter. What was the first job you had out of college? How did that shape you to get where you are now? It’s not such a great story. The truth is that ever since I was young the expectation in my family was that I would go into the family business, so I had no expectation my whole life of doing something else. However, things don’t always go as planned and in December of the last year of my business school, on the 31st of December 1979, I remember vividly, I woke up and said “What the hell am I doing? I can’t do that, that would be crazy!” so I went back to business school and I said “I need a job!”. By that time almost all the interviewing had finished and there were only 3 interviews left: one was Marine Midland Bank and I was terrible in the interview. The second interview did not go well either (a chemicals firm) and then the third interview was with an investment bank called PaineWebber and I really liked the guy and I wound up working there. I hardly knew about the firm or the sector—investment banks were not as well-known as today! My first job was very interesting though. It was a job in the finance department of PaineWebber, where I was essentially a spy for the department: I was looking into different businesses we were involved in. I didn’t realise at the time, but PaineWebber was falling apart. I knew very little about the company, so I had no idea about what was going on and what they were trying to do. The way they were trying to get back control of it was by sending young MBAs like me into different divisions to get some information about the company and report back and make some suggestions as to how profitability could be improved. So my first job was kind of an internal spy at PaineWebber. And because I didn’t know anything about what I was doing, it was really fun. I think nowadays people just have so much information, they know so much about things, and they have such high expectations…. I was only expecting to work for my dad and I was just relieved to have any other job anywhere, doing anything, but the thing that was most important to me was the person I worked for and he turned out to be somebody who was kind of an alternative father figure to me throughout my career. Why did you choose impact investing? Yes well, a combination of guilt and age. Guilt for? Having been successful. I guess it was 1999 when I first started getting involved into impact investing, so I was 42. I have 4 children, and when your children get to be a certain age they ask better questions about why you do what you do and my answers were, you know, incomplete. Like every parent, you tell your kids things about life that you think are important and then they would ask, “OK and what do you do?”. I worked at Lehman Brothers, I worked at Paribas etc. And the growing gap between what I did and what I said was important was just getting to be very painful, so I wanted to do something that made me feel better about what I was doing–something that would make my children proud of me. There wasn’t impact investment as a field so it’s not like I chose to do “impact investing”, I just chose to leave investment banking and do something more socially useful and what happened in the process was that I came upon, and in some respects helped with the early creation of the impact investment community in the UK, together with many others. It wasn’t an industry yet, but I just had a strong sense that I was getting to an age where I wanted to do something that was more meaningful. Would you say you were there right from the beginning? From when impact investment started? It depends when you consider impact investment starting, but my journey began in 1999. And I know that the phrase “impact investment” was only developed in 2007 by the Rockefeller Foundation, because they claim credit, rightly so, for having invented the term. The reason is that Americans hate the word “social investment”. They couldn’t live with the word “social” so they had to create a new phrase. You know Americans have to own things, so they wanted to own this concept and the only way they could live with “social investment” was to re-brand it as “impact investment”. I wouldn’t say I created this field and anyway, you could say that high-impact enterprises go back to the Body Shop as the first very visible modern “social business”. You could also say the modern impact investment movement started with the steps around boycotting South Africa in the late 1970s – early 1980s when people did not want investment capital to support activities that were supporting the regime in South Africa. So that is really when it started and I have no responsibility for that. Can you tell me about your most successful venture? Your biggest successes and failures in the industry? Biggest challenges? The biggest success: The most successful high-impact business I got involved into was also the first. It is a company called JustGiving and they had a very simple idea, which was that they would help people to give money to charities online. In the old days you had to write a cheque and that was very expensive for the charities, because they would have to take the cheque and process it, send it to the bank. It was just a messy bureaucratic process and JustGiving would enable you to do this online…and that was really quite revolutionary. And I thought “Oh this is a really interesting thing, using the Internet to help charities.” Unlike a lot of other businesses at that time, it was, and still is run by 2 women (that is unusual in and of itself—there are too few female entrepreneurs): one was born in Pakistan and one was born in Belgium and they came together in the UK and started this great company. It started with about £5 million and now it is probably worth over £100 million, so it is very successful financially- but most importantly it changed the whole way charities raised money, it massively reduced their cost to fundraise – from 23% to 5% – and in the process they’ve raised over $5 billion for charities and that makes it the largest crowdfunding platform in the world. The biggest failure: In the early days of ClearlySo we wanted to create a business like JustGiving– that was our Motto, but the one thing that I didn’t want to do was investment banking- it was something I’d done my whole life and I thought I’d like to do something different. So I put a lot of my own money into raising funds and starting a company and all that- and there was just one failure after the other: we couldn’t raise a fund, it was just too early, nobody understood what impact investment was about, nobody would accept the idea that you could make money AND create some good, they thought you would either have to do one thing or the other, that you either had to do good or do well but you couldn’t do both at the same time. It wasn’t just one failure but a series of failures, trying to figure out how to help companies, that wanted to change the world, be successful. We tried to raise a fund and we failed and then we tried to raise another fund and failed, tried to offer consulting services and failed, we tried to do an online platform for fundraising- that failed, we tried to do a headhunting activity-that failed. From 2008 to 2011, we kept failing and finally I was running out of money so we met internally and started asking our clients (this was long overdue!), “Actually what do you really want?”. They said, “All this other stuff is great, but we won’t ever pay for it. We’d like you to help us raise investment”. The irony was that after years and years and years of not wanting to do investment banking, what ClearlySo became was an impact investment bank. So it was a series of failures because we couldn’t figure out what our clients, which are high impact enterprises, actually needed. What does a successful venture look like for you and your firm? How do you define success for the ventures you take on? Well, every venture that we take on has to generate a significant amount of social, ethical or environmental impact- this is an essential aspect of every firm we choose to work with, this doesn’t make it successful, it just means that if they aren’t about creating significant impact we don’t take them on as clients. Success is then, I’m afraid, all about financial success. It doesn’t mean that they have to be immensely profitable, some are, some are not, but they have to be sustainable. So a successful business is one that generates enough revenue so that they can survive on their own, without donations, without grants and without further investment. So all our clients are impactful – they should be both impactful and financially sustainable. What are the characteristics that you look for in the founding team? Well, they should have, I think, 2 things:A. One thing that a founding team needs to have is relevant track record in a relevant domain, so if they are in the consumer field they need to have had expertise in the consumer field; if they are in the alternative energy space they should have relevant experience in the alternative energy space. This isn’t a very sophisticated point to take, but they or some member of the management team or the board should have relevant domain expertise. If they don’t have that, it’s a bit crazy.B. A second thing they need to have- and this is harder to judge, they need to be functional as opposed to dysfunctional. You can tell when a team is working like a team and you can tell when it’s just a field full of individuals. A good management team is one where the individuals all work collaboratively to achieve more than what they can each do as individuals. Many teams on the other hand are dysfunctional: where they work against each other, where there is tension, where they are arguing all the time…That isn’t likely to lead to success. Can you identify any investor trends that have been developing in the last years? What do you see as emerging trends in the next years? In the beginning, people were investing a lot in things that sounded great and inspiring. So they went more for the inspirational ideas, ideas such as feeding the hungry and clothing the needy, ideas that would inspire you to think the world would be a better place. In the beginning there was a lot of hope and things that largely appealed only to the heart. Seven-eight years on people see that many of these ventures have not achieved their ambitions—some have failed. So now there is much more attention to the viability of the organisation – “Will it succeed or will I be wasting money that I could just give to charity if I wanted to give it away?”. So I would say that the main change that I’ve seen is one from “Aww, aren’t they nice” to “I think they can really make a difference and I think they can create something sustainable”. So I think investors are shifting from things that sound nice to things that can really be sustainable and make an impact. I would say that that is the biggest change. As more and more investors are getting into this, the businesses that offer good returns are easier to sell than businesses that don’t. Let’s be honest, if a company goes broke it doesn’t create any on-going impact. Many people used to think that impact and return were like a see-saw, so if you had more impact you had less return and if you had more return you had less impact – but that is baloney. The things that are most successful like JustGiving, generate the most impact, and the things that are less successful generate the least impact and why? Cause they went broke. So impact and return are positively correlated and investors are starting to figure that out. How do consumers see the shift? Consumers pay on average 27% more on fair-trade good than they do for other goods that are exactly the same from a value standpoint, e.g. chocolate or coffee. So obviously consumers are willing to pay even it if isn’t a better product, consumers are voting with their wallets and saying, “I care about demonstrating my ethical preferences”. The evidence is clear. The point is that companies that are in sync with the way the new generations are thinking are going to do better and they will get into less trouble. Think of Volkswagen for example, it’s a perfect example of a company that behaved in the old world way and there was a time when people thought they were going to go broke. You have to adapt or you’ll die, no matter how big you are. What is the one thing that you would like to tell every impact venture/ impact investor? I’m just really trying to spend my time doing things that are useful and fun and I think frankly everyone should do that, because if you are not doing that you are just wasting your life. Really. Especially the fun bit. Some people care about making the world a better place, some don’t. That doesn’t bother me. I’d rather that they don’t make the world a worse place, but I think that you should do what is fun for you, what is in your heart, what is your passion. Probably if you do something that you are passionate about you will be doing it well and probably if you do it well you’ll be ok financially. But not to do something that you feel passionately about is tragic. Not as tragic as starving and all that, but we always have to get our perspectives straight. Just because you are an impact venture does not give you the excuse to be incompetent, sloppy or lazy. You still have to be professional and commercial in how you go about things. It’s even more of a reason for you to be commercial and practical because you have much more at stake than just making money, you have beneficiaries at stake. So there is even more riding on what you do and a greater need to take what you are doing seriously and behave professionally. A lot of impact entrepreneurs torture themselves with questions like what is my carbon footprint and what about my supply chain and when they worry so much about everything under the sun they are going to let their businesses run aground. Instead, just recognise that with one venture you cannot solve all the world’s problems. Just think of the one that you are going to solve and solve that. For impact investors, I really do believe that doing good helps you do well financially and that any extra angst that you have around things is offset by how much better you will do by doing well. I think you will get a reward for doing good things.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Impact-Investment-A-Rodney-Schwartz-Interview-600x400.png","June 6, 2017","en",0.995433866977692,0.197586088871503,0.521861951798201,0.0839764400734566,0.196575531736016
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/09/spotlight-conversation-klaudia-bachinger-wisr/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Klaudia Bachinger of WisR","WisR is a networking platform that matches job-seeking, talented elderly people to young entrepreneurs and innovative employers. The goal of the project is to re-integrate the elderly into the working environment, facilitate experience sharing, and bridge the generation gap. Klaudia Bachinger is the founder of WisR and she is really active. If you are a frequent visitor at the Hub, chances are you have seen her hustling about. She took time out of her busy day to talk to us about how her venture came to be, the obstacles along the way, and the vision she has for the future. How did WisR start? Klaudia: WisR started with an idea, which was to create a platform that pairs elderly people, who still want to work and have a lot of knowledge, with young innovative companies, who need that knowledge. The goal is to re-integrate skilled elderly people into the working environment and enable a knowledge and expertise transfer to the next generation. I believe that this is something that is missing in today’s society. I told one of my best friends about the idea and he said, “That’s a great idea! Go do it!”. WisR was selected to be part of the RE: Wien development program. How do you find it so far? What does it mean for WisR? The program is great! We’re in this wonderful group with other startups and we’re all exchanging ideas, which has been fantastic for WisR. The experts and mentors that are part of the program have also been incredibly supportive. They are giving very helpful insight on how we can get to the next step. What are some of the difficulties WisR has had to overcome to get to where it is now? I feel that there are difficulties every week or every two weeks–let’s just say, there’s a lot of ups and downs in starting your own venture but I’d have to say the greatest difficulty so far has been finding the right team. Finding the right people who share your vision, who complete you on both a personal and professional level, and who are willing to jump into the entrepreneurial world has been a challenge. Many people in Austria are understandably not prepared to give up their steady jobs and a certain standard of living to work in a startup. The other big challenge is that WisR is a two-sided platform–we want to fulfil the needs of both groups at the same time. That can be difficult in reality. Let’s say we have a highly skilled senior with a particular expertise. It’s entirely possible that in our current portfolio of companies, there’s no need for that skill and vice-versa so we’re working hard right now to fill those two talent pools to increase the number of both seniors and companies in order to increase the chances of a match. Who should join WisR? What kind of people are WisR looking for? We’ve got two sides. The elderly and the young innovators. So on the elderly side, we’re looking for people who are future-oriented, who want to share their experience but are open to learning new things, who like innovation, and who are interested in connecting with young people. On the company side, we’re looking for startups, innovative companies, companies of any size who are open to the idea of benefiting from the skills and expertise of underutilised elderly people. What would you like to see WisR become? I’d like to see WisR become a community and an inter-generational movement, where people start rethinking the concept of age, and where ideas, knowledge, wisdom, and experience can flow back and forth between generations. Like I said before, this is something that is lacking right now. As I was growing up, it was perfectly normal for multiple generations to live in one house and there was more of a connection between the young and the old. People are now moving away, living alone in large highly populated cities where it’s easy to become anonymous and isolated. While people might think that it’s only the elderly who are isolated, there is however an increasing number of young people who feel the same. This is why I’d like to see WisR become a community, not just to connect skilled people, but to have these people come together, making the world a less lonely place. How can Impact Hub members help WisR? Approach us if you’re looking for a specific skill or somebody, who can support your venture! Or if you are a freelancer looking for support in whatever way!

Over two months later after Impact Hub Vienna’s birthday party celebrating the 7 years of its impactful existence, we invite you to relive this momentous event with us. Please, feel free to exclaim ‘What a wonderful party that was!’’ now and then while reading this post. We kicked off at 16:15 opening the doors to members and their friends. The usual working buzz was replaced with light-hearted conversations and occasional shouts of ‘Place it there, please!’. Tabletops were set up with delicious cakes courtesy of the multi-generational cafe Vollpension, and sandwiches buffet prepared by Brotpiloten using unsold bread, which – despite being still a tasty treat – would have otherwise landed in the trash. At Impact Hub Vienna we party socially-impactfully. As the party unwound around us, conversation flowed and Iss Mich! kept serving alcoholic beverages and soft drinks, you occasionally got a stranger poke you to ask one of the random questions from the Impact Hub Party Bingo. You laughed unabashed about your IHV shenanigans (‘Have you smooched somebody at the Hub?’ following by knowing smiles) and parted friends. The pre-party atmosphere is the perfect setting to be introduced to what Impact Hub members were up to. We set up a small Members’ Market where you could buy scarves that tell a story from Younited Cultures; talk bloody things with Erdbeerwoche and see sustainable sportswear developed by one of the Impact Hub employees, Sophie Thalhammer, who established Fitico Sportswear. After visiting zimtfilm’s little movie studio, you could learn more about going on a yachting trip with Dominik Sarapata from Naleia Yachting International, support multi-generational housing WGE! and try on a unique shirt from mamamu by Magdalena Muszynska. Impact Hub did not forget about making the shopping more fun than it regularly is and each visitor could do one at each stand to get a free drink. Oh, Impact Hub, you know us so well! At 6 pm we were treated to a beautiful and moving piano concert by Matthias Lichtenthaler and everyone stopped and stared. This was probably the only moment in the history of the Hub when it was filled with so many people and still, you could hear a pin drop. A precious moment to treasure. What followed was a combination of hilarious, moving, inspiring and simply historic – we heard emotional talks of gratitude and gratefulness from the top of IHV, our director Matthias Reisinger, as well as Simon from aWATTar, Laura from CARamel, Ahmad, a former host and now part of the IHV team, Katharina from Route28, Gabriela and Betti from Impact Hub Global and Nikolaus, one of our experts and the Co-founder of the Investment Ready Program. They shared their personal Impact Hub stories and magical moments. See for yourself! By the way, you can watch the whole stream of the speeches here. All of us will also never forget this rendering of one of the best moments on British TV – think self-confidence, sweet dance moves and walking in on your father giving a live interview, adult version. After we recovered from what felt like being a victim of a collective ROTFL condition, we returned to mingle and chat, eat delicious food, visited the market couple of times, and had our photos taken in the most unexpected moments. The night went on to the rhythms of music played by B3 und Ulrike Tisch and we celebrated the 7 years cycle together like the family we, Impact Hub Members, are. Special thanks to zimtfilm for taking this video at the party and streemed for setting up and running Facebook Live Stream so those, who couldn’t be with us in person could still be with us virtually. You can view photos from the event on our Facebook page.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/14/spotlight-talking-sustainable-fashion-fitico-sportswear/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: Talking sustainable fashion with Fitico Sportswear"," While fair fashion is increasingly in demand and the awareness of responsible wardrobe becomes more evident in today’s customers shopping patterns, new sustainable brands come across variety of challenges in a bid to establish themselves. Sophie Thalhammer, the founder of Fitico Sportswear, a sustainable performance clothing brand for sports lovers, would know a thing or two about that. We met at the Impact Hub Vienna accidentally during an event organised there (a common occurrence) and after a short conversation, I knew I wanted to find out more about entering the demanding realms of fashion industry when one is a complete newbie in the field. Sophie’s inspiring story is a testament to the support of people who believe in you and the drive to go one step further in making an impact being key to fostering growth. Photo courtesy of Fitico Sportswear What prompted you to create Fitico? I established Fitico because, first of all, I wanted to create something of my own. And I wanted it to be something sustainable,something to make the world a better place. Second reason – out of personal necessity because I am trying to live a sustainable lifestyle and at the same time I like to do sports. I realised that especially in sportswear there are not many labels operating in a sustainable way. How did you go from wanting to live a sustainable life to founding a brand? I mean, a lot of people say they are going to live more sustainably, which translates to ‘I am going to eat organic’ or ‘Buy more things that are not packaged in plastic’. So how did you decide to go a step further? Because I wanted to take it one step further and create more impact than just buy sustainably or make sustainable decisions. Secondly, you know you spend so much time in your work and your work is such an important part of your life, so I wanted to do something meaningful with my work, something that matters. How did you become interested in sustainable sportswear? Again, there are so many other choices for social entrepreneurs. Why did you choose fashion industry? Like I said, out of necessity because I couldn’t find sustainable sportswear brands I really liked. Also because the fashion industry in particular, and within the fashion industry especially the sportswear industry, is operating in such a horrible, harmful way. The factories are mostly sweatshops in South East Asia; workers there suffer from often inhumane working conditions. The companies don’t use sustainable materials or use very very little of them, and there is just so little environmental consciousness about saving resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that I thought I am going to start there and bring change in this specific industry. Tell me about the journey to establishing a social venture. First, you had the idea, what followed then… After I had the idea, I started talking to people, reaching out to people, to fashion designers, graphic designers, textile designers. Very soon I approached people from the industry: the material suppliers, the producers, the manufacturers, to get the basic idea of what I needed and what was possible. And then I also did a lot of research of course, on the Internet, about the fashion market, other sportswear brands, social media strategies – many different things. What were the most challenging parts of establishing your company? There were many challenges but so far I could overcome them all. To find the main material and the additional parts were the first challenges. Then the manufacturer. People in the industry say it is always the manufacturer that is most challenging when you try to create a new label. So that was quite challenging but in the end, I found one in Portugal and I am very happy, very satisfied with the cooperation. The next challenge is to enter the market. And to become heard and become recognisable because, as everyone in the fashion industry and sports industry knows, there are thousands of labels. It is not so easy to stand out. When we met at Impact Hub Vienna some time ago, you mentioned the challenges of entering the market. How is it going now, what are you doing to get people to talk about it? Well, the first priority right now is to establish a web shop and once in place I can start with all the marketing activities. Also, trying to bring people to the web shop. I still need to put more emphasis on social media. I think social media is really crucial for fashion in particular. Was creating your own sportswear more difficult than you thought initially? I would say yes, because I started as a complete beginner. I was new to the industry, I wasn’t working in fashion before, which, on the other hand I think is an advantage because I was not aware of all the challenges I would be facing. (laughs). I did face more challenges than I thought, there were more things I didn’t think of in the beginning. When those things come up, how did you deal with them? Did you do it singlehandedly or did you use support from people, who already had experience? Depends on the challenge. Some of them I had to refer to other people with more experience. In general, I think it always helps to talk to people, even to those who do not have experience in the industry because they can still be supportive. Sometimes I just talk to my boyfriend, or friends, or my family about a problem, and talking about it already helps a lot. Singlehandedly… Very seldom. In the end, I always try to solve problems in a team or through talking to people. Is sustainable fashion industry very specific? It’s very very different to the fast fashion industry, which is almost an industry on its own. Because the prices and the conditions are so different to all the other, smaller and bigger labels and the luxury labels. I think the sustainable fashion industry and the conventional fashion industry are not so different. And I also see the trend of the conventional fashion industry to go more in the direction of sustainable fashion. Photo courtesy of Fitico SportswearWhich sometimes is fake.. Sometimes, but some of them really make an effort. I can see mid-size labels putting more emphasis on the materials they use and on the factories they use. Also, becoming more transparent in their activities and trying to communicate to their customers that they do care. Your first collection spring/summer 2017 collection is reusing fishing nets… How did you come across the idea of using this material? I was looking for a sustainable material for sportswear and of course I came across organic cotton and Tencel [lyocell is a sustainable fabric, regenerated from wood cellulose.]. They are natural fibres which are good for the environment but sometimes not so ideal for workouts because they are not so stretchy, they don’t deliver the support you need, and they sometimes absorb the sweat. Then I found Econyl®, a material which is made of recycled fishing nets. This material had exactly the characteristics I was looking for. Abandoned fishing nets are regenerated into nylon which is then knitted into high-grade polyamide fabric, with a little bit of elastane added for compression. When you do sport you obviously sweat so you need a material that wicks sweat away from the body to help you stay cool and dry, a material that fits and stays tight with every movement and a lot of other requirements for sports. Especially for sports I do, which is Crossfit®. It was perfect, exactly what I was looking for. As a sustainable brand, what are the different challenges in conventional fashion, to get customers? I would say the biggest challenge, but not only for sustainable fashion but for everyone else except for the fast fashion companies, is to get the physical space in big shopping malls, big shopping streets. People still do most of their fashion shopping there and all they can find is fast fashion. Fast fashion brands are the only ones that can afford the rent so in terms of physical space that is a big challenge. Online… I think the challenge is to stand out, to become heard because there simply are so many fashion brands.Sometimes, people have to specifically look for the sustainable brands and this means a lot of extra effort. The online market places are full of conventional brands, and the ones who focus specifically on sustainable brands are much less known. How long have you been at Impact Hub Vienna? It’s exactly one year now! Do you think that being part of Impact Hub Vienna inspired you to go forward with Fitico? Definitely. As I said before, the people around you really matter and during this year at IHV I met so many interesting, inspiring people. It’s really amazing. Without that I don’t know if I would have always kept on going. What would be your advice for people who want to start their own socially impactful venture? First of all, go for it. And just try and start wherever you are. A friend once told me something, that influenced me a lot, namely that so many people think the idea is everything and you have to have a good idea to start. But the idea is only 10%. The rest of is the making. 90% is taking it forward one step at a time.

That’s right – you heard me. No giving up your beloved steaks. No skimping on heat in the frosty winter (well, you know, maybe eat just a little less meat and stuff). Just. Keep. Drinking. Collective Energy, a start-up in Vienna, is offering all wine lovers a chance to be a part of the renewable energy transition, one bottle at a time. It all started with two young Austrians, Julian & Christoph, and their passion for environmental studies at the Universität für Bodenkultur in Vienna. With complimentary Master’s Degrees in Environmental and Biological Resource Management as well as Energy Management and Environmental Politics, the duo came up with an idea to speed up the energy transition. Their motto? “Energie. Gemeinsam. Denken.” Or, Thinking of energy, collectively. After swapping ideas with multiple stakeholders, they developed a business model that could contribute to climate mitigation for generations to come. “The idea is that significant climate change mitigation is only possible through wide-scale, individualised contributions. Our model offers everyone the opportunity to take part in the movement towards renewable energy, which is ultimately necessary to the movement’s success.” Christoph told us. “With that in mind, if we make it so that people’s regular purchasing patterns can directly finance a business’ transition to renewable energy production, we’ve helped everyone in the process – big and small.” Julian explained. Their first project – helping a local brewery make the transition to solar energy production – was a big hit. The two then set up fort at Impact Hub Vienna in 2014 and, winning both the Social Impact Award for 2014 as well as the Social Impact Start Stipendium, were well on their way. You Get Fresh Air! And You Get Fresh Air! And You Get Fresh Air! Their model? Pre-sales crowdfunding with a goal: you help fund the energy transition today, and as a token of appreciation, you get locally grown wine delivered to your door for the next 5 years. Not a bad deal, huh? Take Walek Winery for example – one of Collective Energy’s three original projects. The Waleks live and breathe (and probably drink) wine. Their winery, home to their three children and nestled in Poysdorf (Lower Austria), specialises in white wine. Their latest project? Building a solar-powered cooling system for the warm summer months. Their challenge? Footing the bill for the photovoltaic cell installations. That’s where Collective Energy came in. “We set up their web page, threw fundraising events, consulted them on their marketing methods, and put together a system of pre-sales vouchers that enabled their customers – some regulars and others newly attracted by our campaigning efforts – to contribute to the costs of the PV installation in return for Walek’s specialty wine,” Julian told us. Then, Collective Energy connected Walek with local installers and providers, and next thing you know, Walek just financed their own transition to renewable energy through their most available currency – wine. In a matter of weeks after consulting Collective Energy, Waleks’s wine cellar was being kept cool by 30kWp of PV solar panels that would save an annual 8.4 tons of CO2 emissions for the next 25 years. Isn’t renewable energy magical? And the best part for us, the wine-lovers (besides prolonging the existence of the only planet that can sustain human life)? The packages offered are arguably affordable! For Collective Energy’s current project with Pölz, another family of Austrian winemakers on the green edges of Vienna, an upfront payment of 150 euro gets you 200-euro worth of wine delivered to your door once a year for five years. Or your best friend’s door. Or your mom’s door (is it too early for next year’s Mother’s Day present?). “It’s really about including everyone in this energy revolution – from students to wealthy businesspersons who harbour environmental concerns and an appreciation for local businesses,” Christoph told us. “The only way to effectively tackle climate change and pollution is, after all, on a wide scale. Every effort counts.” Moving Forward – Literally So what’s next? After collaborating with wine and beer makers thus far, Collective Energy will soon be implementing their newest adventure: e-cars! “At the moment, we’re setting up our first venture into e-mobility in Landshut, Germany. The model is similar – the local municipality and a local business cover the upfront costs of installing an e-car sharing hub, while the local community pays those costs back as they partake in the pre-sales e-car sharing scheme over the next years,” Julian explained. The result? An attractive and cheap e-mobility solution for the local community and local businesses. A higher usage rate and a lower risk for the operator. Less greenhouse gas emissions. More space for Landshut residents. Less car maintenance costs for residents. And an extra car always available for those weekend adventures that justified storing an extra hunk of costly, gas guzzling metal in the garage in the first place. “We still want to continue with smaller PV projects, but we figured e-mobility plans could really help out families in smaller cities and towns that have a 2nd or 3rd car they don’t really use that often but are reluctant to give up. Now, they’ll always have access to an extra environmentally friendly car, should they need it, without having to pay upkeep or store the car on their own,” Christoph told us. So, are you craving a nice, chilled, locally grown glass of Welschriesling and a strong gust of crisp, fossil fuel-free summer air yet? Well do I have good news for you!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/22/joadrehubcouture/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: HubCouture"," The Austrian Development Agency (ADA) called for a Social Entrepreneurship Challenge in December of 2015. The idea behind the challenge was to encourage the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in other countries through new ventures. 1 million euros in grants were allocated to the winners, who participated in workshops helping them develop their ideas for 18 months. The winners also pitched their businesses to Impact Hub Vienna recently as part of the ADA program and we caught up with one of them – HubCouture. We spoke with Joana Adesuwa Reiterer, CEO, and Pauline Kolm, Network Director, of HubCouture, to discuss how the venture started, the key lessons learned along the way, and the next steps for the venture now that the program at Impact Hub Vienna is about to come to an end. What made you start your venture? Joana: I had been supporting victims of human trafficking in Austria with my NGO, EXIT, for more than 10 years when I realised that there must be more one can do to prevent people from being trafficked in the first place. The strongest push-factor in regions affected by human trafficking is the lack of job opportunities and dire future prospects. If young people have enough money to take care of themselves and their family, and are able to see a bright and promising future, the risk of being trafficked diminishes so the issue is: how can we improve their livelihood? In these regions, there are many vulnerable people who have excellent handcraft skills and can make amazing products such as leather, fabrics, fashion, and jewellery. However, the problem is that due to structural and financial reasons, it is almost impossible for them to bring their beautiful products to the global market. So the solution to me was clear: I needed a platform that would directly connect these eager and dedicated producers to the consumers, which would then give them access to the global market. Today, I can proudly say that I am the CEO of HubCouture. What were the difficulties you encountered during your entrepreneurial journey? Trafficking is a complex issue and developing a business model that improves the lives of vulnerable people while generating the funds to keep the venture going was a significant challenge. Our platform is not one that will generate significant amounts of revenue in the first few years so finding financial backing is critical to get us from one stage to the next. On the long journey of setting up a business, you come up with many ideas about how to do better and what to improve. While working through these ideas, the easiest and cleverest way becomes difficult to grasp and you are unable to see the wood for the trees. The greatest difficulty for our team has been to stick to one solution, to believe and to fully commit, and to pull it off instead of trying to integrate too many ideas at once. What made you apply to the program? Two reasons: financial support and expert guidance. And I am happy to say that these are two things you surely get once you are accepted into the program. The goals of the program were exactly aligned with what we wanted to do. It gave us the space we needed to experiment and to properly develop our business. How has the program helped you? Thanks to the helpful guidance of the many experts throughout the program, we have been able to come up with a few ideas that are now firm components of our business strategy. What are the 3 key lessons you took out of the program? Pauline: Put your social impact in concrete numbers. How to pitch. It’s extremely difficult to get it right but so important. Good marketing strategies and specific business growth strategies. We’d also like to add that the community at the Hub is fantastic. Speaking with the other ventures during the program and listening to their difficulties, there’s a great sense of community here and it motivates us and keeps us going. What are your next steps after completing the program? Joana: We will continue working as hard as we are now. The fact that so many people are dependent on HubCouture makes the team want to be even more successful. We are excited to take HubCouture to the next level. What is your advice for somebody wanting to start a venture targeting the SDGs? Keep the focus on the social impact. Never forget why you started!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/23/how-to-manage-successful-event/","ImpactHub","8 Things to Keep in Mind to Manage a Successful Event"," Managing an event is not a walk in the park. It can seem overwhelming given all the elements and resources that need to be organised. But organising a successful event? That’s a completely new level! Don’t worry, we are here to help with this list of 8 things to keep in mind to have people rave about your event management skills for years to come. In the photo: Impact Hub Vienna’s 7th Birthday Party #1 Make sure you understand the event Not all events are the same. Make sure that you understand the requirements of the event and provide what’s needed. Different events require different resources. A daytime corporate event will be different from a casual evening networking event. Know what your audience is expecting and work closely with key stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. #2 Work with reputable vendors There’s nothing worse than thinking that everything is going along swimmingly only to suddenly find out that the event you have carefully planned is going to be ruined by an unreliable vendor. To avoid the possibility of this even happening, you have to take the time to vet your vendors carefully. Ask around for referrals from people you trust, ask a vendor about guarantees, and/or if they can provide client references. Managing an event is hard work. Minimise your risk as much as possible. #3 Plan for the unexpected If you’re a believer in Murphy’s law, what can go wrong, will go wrong. Events, big or small, have a lot of moving parts and the unexpected can always happen. In order to not be caught off guard, it’s important to sit down and do a run through of all possible crisis scenarios so that you are prepared in case these things happen. Unforeseen issues always cause a panic because nobody knows how to react. Don’t let this happen to you. Have a plan and know how you’ll react. #4 Create a solid, reliable team You’re likely going to need help managing your event so it’s important to surround yourself with a good team. Assemble a team that you can trust and rely on because you will be relying on your team members to do their part while you’re managing the event. Support your team members and they’ll support you. Create the dynamic that you would want to be a part of. #5 Pay attention to the little things How’s the lighting? How are the acoustics of the space? What does it sound like with one person? What does it sound like if a hundred of people are all talking at the same time during a networking session? How’s the air-conditioning? Is anybody seated directly under a vent where it will be too cold? Even if you manage a successful event, people often remember the little things that rubbed them the wrong way. You can’t lose sight of the big picture, but by paying attention to the little things you will add that extra finesse that will take your event to the next level. #6 Get the word out What’s a great event if nobody knows you’re having one. With all the distractions that are available on any given day, you want your event to stand out and be place that people want to be at. There are different methods and approaches to choose from but whatever method you choose, you’ll want to target and get core supporters on board. Once they come, the network effect will kick in and others will follow. #7 Create a good positive energy We’ve all been to these kinds of events. Everything is going fine but nobody seems to want to be there. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that there’s a good positive energy flowing through your event. How do you do that? It starts with you and your team. You set the tone so make sure you greet every attendee with the positive energy that they can then convey to others. In the photo: CEE Impact Day 2015 #8 Select the right event space It’s essential to select the right event space. Would outdoor be more suitable to the event or indoor? Is it in an easily accessible location? Once you’ve selected a space, how can you enhance the experience of the event by maximising the potential of the venue? It’s not enough to simply find a space, you need to find the right space.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/27/spotlight-conversation-karin-lachmann-wir-design-agency/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A Conversation with Karin Lachmann of wir.agency"," Online conversations are not one-to-one. Communication strategies are constantly in a state of flux and many companies are finding it difficult to break through the information noise in the digital age. The wir.agency helps clients navigate this change by telling their stories visually specializing in illustration, animation, and video. Karin Lachmann is one of the creative leads of wir.agency. We spoke about the founding of wir.agency, the difficulties along the way, how she handles clients, and her approach to a modern working environment. How did wir.agency start? The agency was founded 3 years ago and it all started because my partner, Thomas Philipp, and I were experiencing some difficulties during our respective internships at other design agencies. We were very frustrated and we just thought that there was a better way to work, and that that we could do it better so we started wir.agency to put our ideas into practice. We had no money but we were used to having no money since we were still students at the time so we thought, why not? It’s not going to change our lifestyle that much. We also didn’t have any experience of starting our own business so there was a lot we learned over the years. But, I think it was the best decision we made, which was to just go for it. How did you meet Thomas and why did you decide to work together? We met at Die Graphische. It’s a visual media college here in Vienna. He was studying Photography and I was studying Graphic Design. We started collaborating while we were in school and it went really well, which was a bit of a surprise because we were and still are a couple. There’s a lot of potential for friction but it works for us. Sometimes we have different opinions but we discuss it in a very healthy way. wir.agency specializes in illustration, animation, and video. At the heart of all these services is storytelling. What do you think is the most important element of an effective story? Thomas said something about this the other day and it was so succinct and perfect. He said that the most important element of an effective story is the emotional engagement of the viewer. They need to care about the story you’re telling. What are some of the difficulties wir.agency has had to overcome to get to where it is now? One thing that was quite difficult in the beginning that you probably wouldn’t expect was putting a monetary value on your work. We looked at our competition for some guidance but prices ranged from a student charging 400 euros for a two and a half minute video to a major agency charging tens of thousands for the same service. Where should we be on this scale? We then tried to estimate how much work would be required on an hourly basis but that guesswork was sometimes wildly inaccurate. With the hindsight of experience, we feel it’s about the value we’re offering the client so today, we offer packages. Small, medium, and large. It’s very clear what each package includes so a client knows what they will be getting. They can then assess which package best suits their needs. We feel it’s much better and fairer for both parties and it’s working out really well. Another difficulty, especially in the early stages of the agency when we needed the money, was turning down certain projects that we didn’t agree with. We were lucky in that we got a good number of requests, but some requests were for projects where we didn’t feel comfortable with the politics of the associated parties. Storytelling is a powerful tool and we don’t want to misuse it or use it for negative purposes. We feel very strongly about that. Cash flow was another issue. It’s always important to have some money set aside for unexpected expenses like a medical issue, or equipment failure, or the Ministry of Finance requesting something. It got bad enough where I had to take on a part-time job for a while to keep the business going. I was straddling two different worlds at that time: I was an employee and I was also my own boss. It was a bit strange. How do you approach a project? What are your first steps? The first and foremost step is to create a relationship of trust and honesty with the client. We are extremely client-focused and we want to do what’s best for the client so sometimes they want certain things but we ask them whether they need it. We help them find what’s best for their situation regardless of which package they choose. Sometimes it’s a smaller package than what they wanted because it’s not what they need. To me, fulfilling their needs is more important than the money. The next step is to form a communications strategy appropriate to the client. This could be one video or a series of videos, or graphic design elements–it’s all dependent on the needs of the client. Sometimes we provide a series of different versions and try them all. It’s not bad to try things out in the digital age to see what works best. There’s no harm done. I think this is a part of the process that is often overlooked. How involved is your typical client in the process? What are some of the things you do to guide a project to a successful end where both parties are satisfied? It depends on the client. For example, with clients that are new to online communications, we will involve them more in the process. As far as some of the things we do, we make very clear timelines, set strict deadlines, and we never miss a single one. It is one of our core values: to meet every single deadline. We take project management very seriously and we are very clear about what needs to be done, by when, and by whom. We make communication with the client an absolute priority so they know what stage the project is in at all times and when they need to be more involved. We also make a point to document all communications, requirements, feedback, and expectations so it’s clear to everyone what needs to and will be done. What would you like to see wir.agency become in the future? We are currently expanding and have created flexible teams to react more appropriately to different projects. I think this is an absolute necessity to compete in the modern age and it is probably the future of the creative field. This arrangement is built on trust and I’d like to see everyone trust each other more and be more honest. I would like to see wir.agency become the number one digital agency for trust and online communication. How can members help wir.agency? If you’ve got stories you want to tell, let us know. I love to collaborate and Impact Hub Vienna members are incredibly inspiring!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/07/04/spotlight-conversation-mario-milakovic-yugodom/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A Conversation with Mario Milakovic of Yugodom"," Yugodom is a stay-over museum that’s redefining the hospitality experience. Located in the heart of downtown Belgrade in the Dorcol neighbourhood, Yugodom gives visitors and locals the opportunity to travel back to the times and country that no longer exist: mid-century Yugoslavia. Mario Milakovic is the Founder, Designer, and Creative Director of Yugodom, and a member of Impact Hub Belgrade. He took some time out of his last days in Vienna to talk about how he came up with the idea of his venture, his experience at CEE Impact Day, the Investment Ready Program, and the plans he has for Yugodom’s future. Photo by Monika Pavlovic How did Yugodom start? Where did you get the idea for it? Yugodom is the result of a very natural process that started small and gradually grew bigger and bigger. It wasn’t the standard process of getting an idea, sitting down and writing a detailed business plan. It all started when I had just returned to Belgrade after living in Japan, and I had a spare bedroom, which I was unimaginatively using to store my bike. The apartment was a bit big for me, especially after having gotten used to living in a 13 square meter apartment in Tokyo. At the time, Airbnb was getting more and more popular so I thought: why not make a proper guestroom in my home and see what happens? If it becomes a success on Airbnb, great! If not, I would have a proper guestroom for friends and family. So I started to design the room. I didn’t have very much money so I focused on vintage things that I actually liked, which was and is still quite cheap and available in Serbia. When I was finished, and put the room online, people came! I got a lot of positive feedback and I also unexpectedly got some international media exposure, which led to more demand and that led the way to a second room, which was my room, and then the whole apartment. That’s when the concept of Yugodom all came together. And then I realised that the concept of Yugodom needs bigger space than what it is now so I got involved with Impact Hub. What’s your background? I’m a designer. I have a Bachelor’s in Costume Design and a Master’s in Cultural Studies and I love to do interior design so Yugodom is the coming together of all my interests. I’ve spent quite a bit of time abroad and I think that’s given me a different perspective on things. Why did you choose this particular period of history for Yugodom? I really like mid-century modern design. I think this period of design is just beautiful, natural, and significant. In Serbia, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is authentic given our history and we often only value things that are made abroad. I thought, why not focus on and value the things that are already here. We don’t need to always look abroad for high-quality objects, we have them already. Photo by Monika Pavlovic What is it about mid-century design that appeals to you? It’s the aesthetics, the functionality, and how the pieces are timeless. Even though they were made in the fifties and sixties in Yugoslavia, they’re still very contemporary. Things are not big or heavy so they can be easily moved around and rearranged. These objects fit incredibly well with a contemporary style of living. Also, what I really like about vintage finds is their ability to deliver a unique story of past times. Yugodom took part in the CEE Impact Day. What did you learn? What are your next steps? CEE Impact Day was the culmination of the Investment Ready Program that we’re a part of. It was an incredible learning experience, especially for me because since I’m more on a creative side, I don’t often think of the all the practical aspects involved when it comes to scaling a business so being exposed to those elements was very educational and worthwhile. The network of Impact Hub is also fantastic. I can’t overstate the value of being able to discuss ideas and to reach out to people when you have questions. It’s the crown jewel of the whole experience for me. For someone who’s just making steps into something new like myself, CEE Impact Day and the Investment Ready Program were amazing from A to Z. And the team at Impact Hub Vienna is so supportive and very lovely. As for the next steps, it’s all about scaling up and growing bigger. For that we need to find the right partner. Since hospitality is not the typical industry that people think of when they think start-up, some people get what we’re trying to do, and some people don’t. Therefore, finding the right partner is also another big next step–someone that shares the passion and the vision we have for Yugodom. What are some of the difficulties that Yugodom has had to overcome to get to where it is now? Since it was an idea that grew quite naturally, there weren’t that many growing pains. I just always took the next logical step. Plus, I’m a natural optimist so I tend to forget challenges after they’re solved. I guess the one thing that I’ve realized on this journey is that if I want to grow the idea of Yugodom, I will need to include other people. Even if I’ve been a solopreneur up until this point, if I want to grow, personally and professionally, if I want to spread this idea, it’s important to surround myself with the right team and have a network that I can reach out to and be there for others too, to support and to help. Photo by Monika Pavlovic How do you see Yugodom and your business model affecting society at large? The idea behind the business model is to promote the culture and history of a specific place while upcycling undervalued historical furniture and objects. The social impact and ecological impact we want to have is a core value of our business. In addition to this, we would like to employ a minimum of 30% of our workforce from marginalized groups. In Serbia for example, this would be the Roma people. So if you stay at Yugodom, it’s not just a place to sleep. You’re giving back to the community by helping preserve and celebrate culture while supporting progressive and inclusive work practices. I think it’s important to break stereotypes and demonstrate how ostracized groups are an important and underutilized resource of talent, capability, and potential. What would you like to see Yugodom become? First I’d like to further prove the concept of Yugodom by expanding it into a mid-sized boutique stay-over museum in Belgrade. Long-term, I would like to franchise the idea of Yugodom, which is to take the local history and character of a place, wherever that is, and recreate it in a stay-over museum that runs as a social enterprise. I want Yugodom to set the example of how the hospitality industry can be beneficial for everyone involved: the visitors, the locals, and the workers. In Serbia for example, some hotels are only for visitors and not for local people. I’d like to change that. How can members help Yugodom? I’m open to and very interested in all feedback and love discussing all aspects Yugodom so if you want to talk about it, please, let’s talk about it! And if you can, spread the word and check us out on Facebook and Instagram! And, of course, visit Belgrade and stay at Yugodom!

Yet, how does it hold up when it comes to sustainability? According to the World Economic Forum, we might not be the alpha of the pack, but still going pretty strong, coming fourth. Why? Of course, sustainable city policies play a huge part but what really shakes things up is the vibrancy of the Vienna start-up scene. Whether you are a tree-hugger or more of a pragmatic spirit, to most of us it’s clear that taking better care of our planet would essentially be a good thing. If it only weren’t so damn difficult without the right infrastructure and incentives. Fear not, because this is where sustainable entrepreneurs and their start-ups come in to save the day: new shops and projects keep popping up like mushrooms, which makes it increasingly easy for the environmentally-minded to turn their principles into practice. In this post, I will take you through Vienna’s inner districts, showing you that so much of what your green heart desires is already here. And rest assured – this is only the beginning! First district – Innere Stadt The first district synonymous with luxury, posh clothes and shoes. Fancy bars and restaurants. Yet, luxury doesn’t need to be a one-way street. With the growing number of sustainable restaurants, why not treat yourself while simultaneously indulging the earth for a change? Eating more plant-based is a delicious way to help save the planet. After all, animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of pollution and global warming. What better way to stand up for Mother Earth than relishing in the delicacies served at the many vegetarian or vegan restaurants of the first district? Yamm is exactly as yummy as it sounds. Many think it is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in town – I can certainly not argue with that. Whether for breakfast, lunch, coffee or after-work drinks, you will always find creative combinations that ignite fireworks on your taste buds. All of which include lots of fresh vegetables and herbs, sweet-dripping fruits as well as a rainbow of different spices. The vegetarian creations at Tian taste as delicious as the name of the restaurant itself: Tian means ‘heaven’ in Chinese. Maybe that’s because they get their ingredients come from their own organic nursery in Greifenburg. Their art of cooking even got them a Michelin star. While the price tag might be a bit hefty for a common day, it is certainly a wonderful place to go to on a special occasion. Alternatively, you could try their lunch menu, which tends to be a bit cheaper. Hidden Kitchen is also a hotspot for vegetarian and vegan lunches. It boasts daily changing scrumptious salad variations that will make you salivate just by hearing them: quinoa salad with yellow courgette, artichokes, lemon, arugula, and capers, or arugula salad with apricots, roasted walnuts and raspberry balsamic vinegar. Oh my. While we are at it, why not finish off with a bang? If you have a sweet tooth you will surely rejoice at the plant-based, organic treats sold at the Simply Raw Bakery. Considering that they are even made without added sugar, why not grab a second one – guilt-free of course! Second District – Leopoldstadt As you cross the Danube Canal to the second district, you enter the habitat of the nouveau hip Leopoldstädter. Whereas only a couple of years ago, this district was not too appealing to visit, now start-ups, coffeeshops, world food restaurants and of course, sustainable projects keep popping up in ever-increasing quantities. For instance, Lunzer’s Maßgreisslerei has made zero waste shopping easy. Fresh fruit and vegetables, milk, bread, cheese and meat are equally obtainable without packaging as shampoo and laundry detergent. No poor plastic bag had to die for your products here. Moving on from buying food to eating food: the company Iss Mich fights food wastage by using perfectly healthy veggies that did not meet aesthetic retail standards for their delicious organic vegetarian dishes. They offer a delivery service for those lazy days on the couch or catering for special events. Third District – Landstraße The sustainable entrepreneurs in the third district also care about zero waste living and battling wasteful consumerism. Similar to Lunzer’s Maßgreisslerei, the Warenhandlung Wenighofer und Wanits offers regional and organic pantry staples, fresh fruit, veggies, bread, meat and dairy without packaging. They thus play a pivotal role in making zero waste feasible in daily life. Because let’s be honest: how many third district dwellers will take it upon themselves to journey to another district for the sake of saving plastic if the standard grocery stores are just around the corner? Convenience wins. Now, with shops like this, sustainability finally becomes convenient. Once you banned plastic from your kitchen, next comes the bathroom. Package-free toothpaste? Eco-friendly lipstick? And not to forget plastic-free sanitary pads? These things are harder to come by. Unless you visit the cheerfully decorated Sonnengrün store, where all these products stand in rank and file next to tin boxes filled with chemical-free deodorant, beard balm or face cream. As if this weren’t already enough, animal lovers can even get soap for their pooch and a special cream for its sore paws. If you amble down just another street, you find a store dedicated to high-quality and skin-friendly eco-soap. Not all soaps were created equal – and the manufacture Wiener Seife makes, if you like, the queen of all soaps. For over 10 years, these sensual pieces for hair, body and beard have been hand-made using coconut oil as a basis. They protect the skin with the power of nature, devoid of chemical additives, mineral oils or preservatives. And boy, do they smell good! Thanks be to the natural oils, plant extracts and fragrance essences they use, many of which are from controlled organic sources. Bonus fact: Did you know that solid soap lasts you for much longer than liquid shower gels? Fourth District – Wieden Moving on from the beauty department to the fourth district, Wieden. Here you can find Gabarage, an upcycling design store, where trash gets a makeover. Ageing skis and snowboards, clothes hangers, bracelet and rings are given a new, stylish life. Old folders are transformed into trendy bags and escalator stairs arise from the dead in the guise of sofas. Nothing is thrown away. The team of Gabarage takes it one step further though. In the truest spirit of social entrepreneurship, they offer vocational qualifications and workplaces for disadvantaged groups of people who have a hard time (re-)entering the regular labour market. Fifth District – Margareten Quick, quick, moving on to the next district, because there is so much left to explore! Looking for a piano? An antique chest of drawers? A fancy armchair? A racing bike? A food processor? A drilling machine? A ballgown? Look no further than Margareten, Vienna’s fifth district. Here, you can find everything you need (and don’t need) in two fantastic thrift stores. Carla Mittersteig is the downtown branch of Carla Wien, a charitable organisation, where people can donate stuff they don’t use anymore. In four massive halls with 4,000 square metres, you can go on a veritable treasure hunt. Didn’t find that Egyptian belly dancing belt you so desperately needed? First let me say, I’m quite surprised because Carla really gives you the impression they stock everything. Nonetheless there is another equally fun thrift shop called 48er Tandler just a block away. They pick up items at the local dump, the lost property office and items no longer needed by employees of the City of Vienna in the name of waste prevention; vintage furniture, tableware, clothing, books, sports equipment and real bargains are then sold at the store. Their proceeds go to the TierQuarTier, the local animal shelter, as well as other charitable institutions, including a care and integration centre for refugees and a homeless shelter. Sixth District – Mariahilf So after you decided to buy that delightfully retro city bike you found at Carla Mittersteig, what are you going to do with it? Are you one of those people who abhor leaving their beloved bike in the courtyard of your residential building? Do you also drag it into your flat share on the fifth floor (no elevator) for fear of it being stolen? Then the Rad WG, the ‘flat share for bikes’ is what you need. The founders of this start-up realised the potential of empty ground-floor premises and turned them into regular bicycle parking spaces. For a monthly contribution, you can give your bike a safe home, instead of it being knocked over by that drunken student friend at one of your infamous house parties. In addition, the bike flat share is a space that brings bicycle lovers together. You might even find new friends at one of their bike workshops. That’s a bingo! Seventh District – Neubau Next stop, Neubau! Summer is coming and you need new clothes. You should definitely check out the many sustainable clothing stores in Vienna. Especially as stylish eco-fashion is no longer an oxymoron. Gone are the days when sustainable clothes looked like shabby potato bags. Today, not only do clothes make you look good, you can also feel good since you know that the factory worker behind your jeans got fair pay and the environment wasn’t harmed either. This is what I call a genuine retail therapy. There is a host of shops you can check out in the seventh district. At Combinat, they sell recycled fashion, at the ethical concept store ebenBERG you can find ladies’ collections, Zerum sells GOTS certified clothes, Maronski sells sustainable and fair fashion for men and women, Minimal sells children’s apparel, and at Rotknopf, the progressive gentleman of today can even get a tailor-made, GOTS certified suit that was produced under fair working conditions. The list goes on and on. Ethical, fair-trade, and ecological fashion retailers are sprinkled all over the city. Eighth District – Josefstadt Has the shopping tour worn you out yet? Sick and tired of buying ever-increasing heaps of STUFF? Sustainability not only means buying the right things, it also means buying fewer things. Luckily, Vienna already offers many opportunities for breaking out of the consumer-culture cycle. Are you ready for getting your hands dirty? In the mood for producing something yourself? Then maybe you’d enjoy joining an urban gardening community. Since May 2015, the Albertgarten in the Josefstadt offers you a social experience on top of crispy lettuce and crunchy carrots. By ballot, a motley group of people is brought together to tend collectively to one garden patch. At the Pfeilgarten and Tigergarten, a third of the yearly plots are dedicated to greenhorn gardeners eager to join the crew. Ninth District – Alsergrund If you have a hard timekeeping even your cactus alive, gardening might not be the most advisable option for sustainable consumption. This is where food co-ops might come in. They are a self-organised collective of people or households who source products directly from local farms, nurseries, beekeepers and so on. The food is usually seasonally, regionally, and ecologically sustainable as well as socially just. Food co-ops are more than healthy food choices. They are an expression of criticism of the current agricultural industry, characterised by polluting practices, mistreatment of animals, long transport routes and inequalities. The Kukuruz co-op is one of many in Vienna and is currently open for new members. Another way of escaping consumerism is the Open Bookshelf initiative. Here, people can leave their unwanted books for somebody else to enjoy for free. Do whatever you want: take them out, bring them back, love them forever. Anything goes, as long as you don’t sell them. That is just….not the point. And the last rule of sustainability is – never purchase what you can repair. Even if you aren’t an adept craftsman (or craftswoman), there are many options for mending instead of spending. In the ninth district, the Fahrrad.Selbsthilfe.Werkstatt will get your broken bike moving again – with 100m² workshop space, lots of spare parts, tools and people who can show you how it’s done. Cost factor: €4 for an entire afternoon’s use of the workshop. So after having come full circle on our sustainability tour through Vienna’s inner district, we are still nowhere near done. Why? First, because the initiatives listed in this post are only the tip of the iceberg – there are so many more awesome projects to check out in district 1 to 9. Second, because we only explored about half of Vienna so far. So if you are interested in what else awaits, stay tuned for part two of the Vienna sustainability series in which we’ll meet the eco-pioneers of the outer districts. We’ll get to know the team of Wohnwagon, who build off-the-grid and self-sufficient Tiny Houses on wheels in the 16th district. We’ll visit the boutique hotel Stadthalle in the 15th district, a zero-energy hotel with a lovely garden. In the 18th district, we’ll look at Good Goods who sell sustainable and affordable designer ware from sheltered workshops for the handicapped. See you next time!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Sustainability-is-Here-to-Stay-A-Viennese-Perspective-600x400.png","July 7, 2017","en",0.996056973934174,0.13166697107954,0.224921750525633,0.100579281648,0.54283195734024

What is it that makes content worthy of the incredible power of viral word-of-mouth? If you want your idea or product to spread then this book will help you to do that. The author lays down six principles of content contagiousness, namely: 1. Social Currency 2. Triggers 3. Emotion 4. Public 5. Practical Value 6. Stories “By “contagious”, I mean likely to spread. To diffuse from person to person via word of mouth and social influence. To be talked about, shared, or imitated by consumers, coworkers, and constituents” writes Jonah Berger. Having your content go viral can be many marketers’ dream, and using the elements of contagiousness when crafting your next piece of content will help achieve your goal. #3 Connected: How Your Friends’ Friends’ Friends Affect Everything You Feel Think And Do by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H.

Kahneman, a Nobel prize winner for his work on decision-making, explains how people go about decision making and why they engage in particular behaviour. If you want to persuade your customers by bringing up rational arguments, you might be missing on a very important aspect of decision making which is intuitive thinking. Kahneman explains how both intuitive and rational thinking works together to persuade your audience. #8 Purple Cow by Seth Godin The marketing icon Seth Godin envisioned Purple Cow to be the hands on guide to making a brand remarkable through innovation. He argues that the traditional way of marketing through advertising and distribution has become obsolete and that innovative ways of marketing are required to cut through the clutter of products and advertising. Godin believes that we are in a post advertising era where word of mouth works more effectively than plain advertising. And thanks to social media platforms reviews about products and services spread more quickly. As a social media manager, one needs to understand how to stand out in the crowded world of mass advertising and make their products and services more likeable and shared. Did you like this post?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/07/18/10-questions-hub-member-marlene-welzl/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: 10 Questions with Hub Member Marlene Welzl"," Marlene Welzl radiates with positive energy, kindness, and a true spirit. She is a key member of WGE! Gemeinsam Wohnen, an organisation that promotes and facilitates mixed generational housing in Vienna. We chatted about what she loves about the Hub, what inspires her, and her love of Schwarzbrot. How did you find out about Impact Hub Vienna? Marlene: Actually, it’s a funny story, I’ve known about the Hub since the very beginning. 7 years ago, I was a student and a member of AIESEC which is the world’s largest non-profit, student-run organisation, and I attended a conference here at the Hub while it was being renovated. In fact, I’m actually in one of the pictures that’s hanging on the wall! It’s the photo where there’s a gathering of people sitting around and the photo is taken from behind so you can’t see anyone’s faces. I was sitting at the dining table the other day and was looking at the photo and had this sort of déjà vu and realised that it was me! I recognised my shoes! Where did you grow up? I grew up in Linz which is in Upper Austria. I grew up in an inter-generational environment which has greatly influenced my desire to be a part of WGE! My grandmother, who I’m really close to, lived with us for a few years and she’s been such a huge influence on my life. I’m pretty sure that one of the main reasons I have a good and disciplined work ethic is because of her. She always set such a good example. I learned so much from her and she in turn got a lot of joy out of taking care of me and going with me to the playground–it kept her young and it kept her healthy. I really loved the time I spent with her when I was growing up and feel very lucky to have had that experience. What do you love about Vienna? What’s your favourite spot? I love the mixture between the city and the countryside. Don’t get me wrong, Vienna is a metropolis which I do enjoy but you can also take the tram and be in the woods where you can go for nice walks surrounded by nature. I guess I like how accessible the countryside is which is important for me because I grew up in Linz surrounded by nature. My favourite spot in Vienna is a glade on top of Pötzleinsdorfer Schloßpark. There’s a terrific view of Vienna and it’s a great place to take some time and think. I go there when I have a lot on my mind. How did you get involved with WGE!? I’ve been involved with WGE! since almost the very first days of the organisation. I remember how I heard about WGE! very clearly. It was the day after I handed in my Master’s thesis during the summer. I was at an open-air swimming pool with a very good friend of mine when she told me about the idea for WGE! There was no doubt in my mind. I immediately loved the idea and wanted to be a part of it. Why did you become a social entrepreneur? I’ve always wanted a career where I would have a positive impact on society and social entrepreneurship allows you to do that. I like the independence that goes with it, how I need to be creative in solving problems, and the satisfaction of achieving goals that I know have social benefit. What do you love about the Hub? I like that the Hub is filled with like-minded people who are willing to support and help your project. I love the opportunity it offers me to improve my skills and to further develop WGE! I’ve also never left the Hub without having a fair amount of food for thought for my bike ride back home. You meet so many great people with so many different skills and talents and I love hearing all their different points of view. What are some books or movies that have inspired you? Stefan Zweig’s “Die Welt von Gestern” (The World of Yesterday). The book conveys an idea that I try to live by which is that you can’t just let things happen. You have to be the change you want to see. “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.” It’s not just because the movie is so thoroughly enjoyable and a lot of fun, but there’s this quote by Oscar Wilde in it that’s perfect: “Everything is going to be fine in the end. If it’s not fine it’s not the end.” “Little Miss Sunshine.” It’s hilarious and I love what it’s about: the most important thing is to pursue your dreams, whether you realise them or not. “Toni Erdmann.” I guess I like comedy-dramas so this is another great one. Again, I love the message of the film: focus on the things you enjoy in life and don’t get distracted by fulfilling the expectations of others. Do you get stressed? How do you cope with it? What do you do to relax? I do get stressed. Everybody does so I’m no exception. To cope with stress I like to do physically active things so I go swimming. When I do anything physical like gardening or sports, it helps clear my mind because I don’t think about anything, I just focus on what I’m doing. I also like going to the movies as opposed to just watching a movie at home or on my computer. I like the atmosphere, the audience, the big screen. What food can you not live without? Schwarzbrot. Especially from Upper Austria. It’s quite honestly one of the best things in the world. What else are you up to? I’m trying to develop some of my artistic skills. I absolutely can’t draw anything so I’m trying to learn how to draw. I’m also currently learning to play the piano. I’ve always wanted to learn, and I’ve been meaning to do it for a long time but it’s still kind of strange how it all came together actually. My grandmother had a piano that she no longer wanted and at the same time, my flatmate, who is studying to be a music teacher, was looking for a student. Perfect! Sign me up!

Practices were rained out. Schedules conflicted. But Rugby Opens Borders (ROB) didn’t quit until young boys and girls – refugees and locals – found new families on and off the pitch. How to Make Friends: Tackle Them In summer of 2015, people from all over the world were arriving at Vienna’s train stations. Some were escaping war-torn countries; others were seeking new opportunities for growth – but all were in need of a sense of belonging to their new city. That’s when ROB founder and player at Rugby Union Donau, Udo Richson, had an idea. “Rugby builds families.” He told me when we first met last spring. “You engage in a collective sacrifice for one another. There are no differences between you and your teammates – nationality, language, religion – it’s all the same on the pitch.” So Udo put together a team of individuals experienced in coaching, pedagogy, social work, economics, and media relations, and gave life to ROB – an organization aimed at integrating young refugees in Vienna. It does so not only through gathering refugees and locals on the pitch, but also around the dinner table, in the movie theaters, and in free tutoring sessions. In other words, the young boys who joined ROB had found their new family and, within months, ROB had gathered a team of committed young refugees who showed up for training at the Rugby Union Donau sports center in the Prater every week. Speaking German on and off the pitch so as to encourage linguistic development, ROB’s coaches have since taken on the role of mentoring the youth in their athletic, educational, and personal endeavors – a role that is arguably necessary for anyone in such formative years. Something is… Missing But there was a glaring gap in ROB’s model when I first met Udo last spring. “And the girls?” I asked. “We’re trying.” Udo responded, clearly having already noticed and been troubled by the fact ROB was missing a girl’s team. “But it’s not easy.” Getting the girls involved in ROB meant a different set of obstacles. For example, where many of the girls come from, their communities had told them that sports were only for the boys. For girls, playing sports, especially one as contact as rugby, was unusual. But noting that the girls already had schedules packed with yoga, football, skiing, and German courses, it was clear that trying something new wasn’t their main obstacle. “You could see the excitement on the girls’ faces when we were explaining ROB to them,” Ana Ruiz, or “Mini” as she goes by, told me. Mini has taken charge of ROB’s initiative to build a girl’s team in the last year. “They’re just children, excited to get out and try new things. So you could really feel that they wanted to get involved.” She told us of her visits to Vienna’s refugee centers, from where ROB’s young players are recruited. So where did their hesitance for ROB come from? “One of the biggest difficulties was recruiting enough girls so that the boys’ and girls’ practices could be kept separate yet substantive,” Mini told us. “When we proposed mixed training sessions, the girls were a bit hesitant to train together with the boys.” She recalled. “They were much more eager to establish their own team first.” So ROB worked towards establishing a girl’s team with persistence. “We just kept going to the refugee housing facilities and tossing the ball around with the girls. We picked the girls up for trainings, and we accompanied them from the facilities to the field. We showed them videos of women’s teams from their regions playing rugby to normalize the image in their mind. We supplied them with the necessary clothing to take part in trainings. We got their phone numbers to keep them informed on the dates and times of trainings and matches. We personalized the connection between us and them so that we were laughing and chatting whenever we did meet. And finally, we established separate practices for the girls so that the ones who were uncomfortable around the boys could have their own space.” Mini explained. “It was a process, but it worked!” Today, a team of committed girls consistently show up to training every week. Mini, who coaches the team alongside Sophie Koller and Charlotte Schönherr – all members of the Rugby Union Donau Women’s Team – helps put together fun, interactive trainings for the girls to build their skills while ensuring an enjoyable process of becoming a rugby player. And after each training, the boys, girls, men, and women of ROB get together over a meal cooked by ROB volunteers as laughs and smiles fill the room. Rugby & Ramadan As such, the girl’s and boy’s programs continue to grow both in numbers and cohesion with each month. Even Ramadan, which can be exhausting for some members who are fasting from sunrise to sundown, was seen as an opportunity to celebrate collectively. Rather than cancel the trainings, ROB moved them to the evenings, so that afterward, volunteers and members could break the fast together—a truly bonding experience. While the boys’ program won the 2016 World Rugby Award for Character and recently attended the United World Games in Klagenfurt, where they were able to play teams from all over the world, the girls’ team envisions a similar trajectory of success and recognition over the coming years. The next step is to incorporate the ROB girls’ team with the Austrian girls’ teams so as to further encourage integration and skills development. While the boys’ program has come so far in its relationships and success, the girls team is on its way to doing just the same. If people looking to create positive social impact can learn anything from ROB’s journey to where they stand now, it’s to keep getting up and moving forward, no matter how many times you get tackled.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/08/14/sustainable-fashion-in-vienna/","ImpactHub","Sustainable Fashion in Vienna","Looking good and wearing the latest fashion is a way in which we as humans can express our individuality. Thanks to globalization, the rising trend of fast-fashion makes it easier for people to reflect their personal style by purchasing cheap and trendy clothes. People can browse clothing options from around the globe sitting in the comfort of their own home. But how often do we ask ourselves where our clothes come from, who made them, and how were they made? There is, of course, no harm in trying to look good. There is no shame in feeling better after you buy a shirt that fits you perfectly. The problem is that when we are not conscious of how our clothes were made, what type of fabrics were used, and who made them, we may inadvertently be supporting bad practices, unfair trade, child exploitation, animal cruelty, and pollution. And that is a big price to pay for a trendy outfit. The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world with one of the largest carbon footprints of any other industry. Harmful pesticides are often used in cotton farming and the waste created by clothing disposal is growing exponentially every year. So is there a way to keep your fashion on trend and avoid contributing to this harmful industry? Yes! The growing trend of sustainable fashion offers consumers an alternative to the harmful fast-fashion products. Several local entrepreneurs in Vienna have based their business on their belief that fashion can be sustainable without human and animal exploitation. Here are a few of our favorite retailers selling sustainable fashion in Vienna. Green Ground Located in Porzellangasse 14-16, Green Ground sells “organic fashion that does not look like eco fashion.” While many organic fashion stores sell clothes that seem more “hippy” and not as on trend as clothes you would find at Zara or H&M, this store focuses on selling stylish and chic clothes that fashion-forward consumers will love. Featuring many sustainable and fair trade brands such as Coccoon, Brainshirt and Green Bomb, if you are into modern designs this is the place to be.

But in the pursuit of building a customer base, we shouldn’t forget the importance of customer satisfaction. Getting people to buy is critical. But getting people to buy, and then buy again, and to encourage friends to buy is fundamental to long-term success. As your company grows, it is important to measure customer satisfaction and recognize how high customer satisfaction which results in customer retention puts you on the path towards profitability. Customer satisfaction through customer service is not a vague or abstract concept—it is tangible and measurable. When products are recommended by friends or family, people are 4 times more likely to buy it. Customer satisfaction is essential for referrals so in order to ensure a high-level of customer service in your organization, make it an integral part of your company culture. Save money The cost of acquiring a new customer vs. retaining a customer varies between 4 to 10 times. However you’d like to look at it, it always costs more to get a new customer than to keep one. The right balance needs to be struck between the two and it is worth looking into what works for your company. Measuring and allocating the appropriate resources and implementing customer satisfaction strategies will save you money in the long-term by increasing customer loyalty while decreasing customer turnover. 6 customer service essentials It starts with your company culture. If you don’t make top-quality customer service a part of your culture, you won’t get the customer satisfaction you’re looking for. It’s as simple as that. If you’re looking to improve your customer service, it’s important to do the following 6 things. Ensure that you’re clearly conveying the value you provide customers. Make sure that your employees understand and can accurately describe the benefits your company offers to current and future customers. Talk to your customers after the sale. Check in with one of the most important parts of your business and create a feedback loop. Get on the phone and ask them about their customer service experience and whether they are satisfied. Did you meet or exceed expectations? Use what you learn to optimize the relationship. Take your customer relationship to the next level. Be the solution to not just one of your customer’s problems, but all of them. Work with them to understand their goals and try to align your products accordingly. If you can become integral to their business strategy, they will be a lifetime customer and they will open new opportunities through referrals and organic promotion. Their success will be your success. Invest in your employees. It’s not just about the customers. This Harvard Business Review study said it best: “Profit and growth are stimulated primarily by customer loyalty. Loyalty is a direct result of customer satisfaction. Satisfaction is largely influenced by the value of services provided to customers. Value is created by satisfied, loyal, and productive employees.” Go beyond culture and make it a key performance indicator. Evaluate customer satisfaction at least once per quarter. Get feedback through surveys and interviews instead of just reacting to problems. Be proactive instead of reactive. Set clear goals on how to consistently improve customer satisfaction and make it part of your growth strategy. Conduct an exit interview. Not every customer stays onboard. They leave for all kinds of reasons but it is important that you understand why. Can you identify any trends from leaving customers? Is it a cost issue or something you overlooked? This may be the best time to get critical and honest feedback. It may be difficult, but don’t miss this opportunity to improve your business. It’s never too early or too late measure and improve customer service and customer satisfaction. Following these steps will allow you to reap the rewards of high customer satisfaction. It is essential to the long-term viability and success of your company. Remember, acquiring new customers is a skill. Retaining them is an art.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/StockSnap_6BUTCIEUN6-600x400.jpg","August 21, 2017","en",0.993372321128845,0.00224219914525747,0.511440634727478,0.002532061887905,0.483785152435303

Karin Lachmann is one of the creative leads at wir.agency, a design agency that specializes in visual storytelling. Karin took time out of her busy day to sit down and talk about where she grew up, her life, french fries, and how she handles a lot of work. Where did you grow up? I was born in Linz and grew up in the Mühlviertel. I actually grew up in the middle of a forest. There were three houses and a bunch of trees surrounding us so it was quite literally in the middle of a forest. My neighbors were a bunch of boys around my age so we were the gang of this really really small community and I was the leader! We cycled around the forest and were explorers. That’s how we spent our days. We were free to do what we liked until sunset. During my rebellious teenage years, my family actually ended up moving to Linz and I founded a manga club that had 150 members! It was a lot of work. This was before Facebook so coordination was basically going through a long list of mobile phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Unfortunately I had to end it when I moved to Vienna. What are some of the difficulties you had to overcome to get to where you are now? There were some issues growing up once I got to school. My mother is Filipino and it’s interesting how I didn’t know I was different until I went to school. My gang of friends from the middle of the forest never treated me any different but then I got to school and the bullying started because I looked different. It also didn’t help that there were only 6 girls and 24 boys so I got even more bullying due to the gender imbalance. Those times were very hard because I was an 8-year old girl and I looked different but it did toughen me up. When I was 12, my father passed away. He was a tinkerer. He built his own boats and taught me how to sail. And he was very interested in CB radios and built his own. His call sign was Whiskey Lima. Whiskey for Walter and Lima for Lachmann. When he passed, that was a very difficult time as well and quite suddenly, I had to grow up really fast, and raise my two younger siblings with my mom. As for professionally, I always wanted to work in the creative world. My dream was to become a fashion designer and that’s why I moved to Vienna, to study fashion. My dream was crushed when I was rejected by the school so I guess it wasn’t meant to be. So I retreated to my manga interests and studied Japanese studies and graduated with a Bachelor’s. But I didn’t give up on my creative dreams. I applied to Die Graphische to study Graphic Design because I always loved to draw. I got rejected. Again. Dealing with all this rejection was difficult because at first I just felt absolutely worthless. I put so much pressure on myself and all I wanted was to get into the school. But, after many tears and now with the benefit of hindsight, I think these setbacks were good. It gave me time to reflect about what went wrong. With fashion, I think my heart wasn’t in it–I just didn’t know what else to do and I think they felt that in my application. For Die Graphische, they told me that I wasn’t right for the school and I learned that while I love to draw, and while drawing is important in graphic design, it’s not everything. My first portfolio submission was only illustrations. I had to adapt. So I learned other important graphic design elements like composition and typography. I reapplied to Die Graphische and was accepted. Finally! Do you still want to become a fashion designer? Now I do fashion just for myself so I’ve made my own backpack and my own pants. It’s more of a hobby. Sometimes, out of broken dreams, you can create hobbies! How did you find out about Impact Hub Vienna? I found out about Impact Hub through Creative Mornings. It was an event and it was at the Hub. I really liked the space and thought it was beautiful. Good lighting, bright, and everyone is so nice. It took me a while to sign up because my creative process isn’t the most mobile. I need my own creative space that is set up the way I need it to be. What do you love about Impact Hub? I love the community, the space, the events, and the location. Everything! What do you love about Vienna? Do you have a favorite spot? I love how Vienna is the perfect size. It’s the perfect size for a capital. You can run into people you know on the street but it’s big enough to give you the anonymity of a big city. There’s a lot of events, lots of things to do, and I feel you can find your community here, whatever that may be. My favorite spot is the main library, the Hauptbücherei. I don’t know how many hundreds of books I’ve borrowed over the years. There’s a borrowing limit of 25 books at any one time but I reach that limit almost all the time. I also love the restaurant on top, OBEN. They have great food and it’s an amazing view. What food can you not live without? French fries. Or what I’d like to call “frittierte Sonnenstrahlen” (fried rays of sunshine). I’m not the originator of that term–I just read it on Twitter and really like it. What are some books or movies that have inspired you? The Harry Potter series. Both the books and the movies. I don’t know how many times I’ve read the books or how many times I’ve watched the movies. It’s definitely a lot. When I’m down, I watch them and they pick me up. Since I’m a huge fan of manga, “Dragonball”. I think both this series and the Harry Potter series have helped shape my outlook on life. There’s light and dark in people. Bad characters always have the opportunity to do good if they choose the right path. Vegeta in Dragonball. Snape in Harry Potter. I’m also a big fan of Studio Ghibli movies. “Princess Mononoke” is my favorite. It’s got everything and again, everyone has darkness and light in them and it’s about what people choose to do. During busy times, how do you handle an above average workload? I try to get work done early in the morning so I get up at around 5 or 6. I go to bed at around 10 pm so don’t think I’m the type of person who doesn’t need sleep. I get my 7 to 8 hours. There’s just something about that time in the morning, you can’t hear anybody on the street because everyone is still asleep, and it just works for me. I get a lot done! Do you get stressed? What do you do to relax? I get stressed just like everyone. To relax, I watch Harry Potter. It’s my go to. It really does relax me or I go do something physically active or meet up with friends. What else are you up to? I’m naturally curious. I always want to learn and I always think I don’t know anything so right now I’m really into audiobooks and I’m listening to Elon Musk’s biography. There’s also a couple of other audiobooks that I’m currently listening to: “The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck” and “Sapiens.” Fascinating! I’m also involved in skillsharing. I’ve always got something to do!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/08/28/accounting-essentials-entrepreneur/","ImpactHub","Accounting essentials for entrepreneurs"," It may not be the buzziest or the sexiest thing about running a business, but when you’re starting out, it all boils down to euros and cents. Accounting requires an attention to detail that either bores people to tears or sends them running for the hills screaming the word ‘outsource’. But having some fundamental accounting knowledge and knowing what the numbers are telling you is a must for entrepreneurs–it will allow you to gauge the financial health of your company and understand how numbers affect how people see your business. Most companies operating in the European Union are required to prepare financial statements. Many of these companies need to prepare financial statements according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These standards are developed by an independent body based in London called the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). You will need to check with your respective national business register to find out exactly what to file and how to file it. These standards are what certified or chartered accountants use to create reports. Understanding these concepts can only help your business going forward. Separate business expenses from personal You might be tempted to fudge the line between these two but it is important to keep them separate. Unless you’re extremely adept at taking a deep dive and spending weeks sorting through both business and personal expense records at a critical time when you have everything else to do, start off on the right foot and keep it separate. You may not be able to see it now but it will pay off in the long run, especially if you need to go through an audit. Time period principle Set defined time periods for your reports and be specific. Usually, reports are monthly, quarterly, or annually. Once you have established your reporting time period, make sure to include a header indicating the time period covered by the financial statement. For example, a cash-flow statement could have the heading: “For the month ended June 30.” Since balance sheets indicate a snapshot in time, the header would state: “as of June 30.” Revenue recognition Many people think that revenue is only earned when the money is in your bank account. In accounting, revenue is different from cash. Revenue can be recognized when you earn it. As an example, if you sold a product or a service in January and issued a net-90 day invoice term, the revenue from the sale would be recognized in January even though you may not get paid until April. Alternatively, if you got paid in advance, you wouldn’t recognize the revenue until you delivered on the contract. This concept forms the basis of accrual accounting which is mandated by the IFRS. Expense recognition and the matching principle Expenses are recognized similarly to revenue–they should be recognized when they are used regardless of when you actually spent the money. In addition, with regards to the matching principle, expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they are related to. Say you spent €5,000 on a project now that will only deliver revenue next year. You would recognize the expense next year, even though you already spent the cash. Or let’s say you had to invest a lot of money in new equipment. That large expense can be recognized over the projected life-span of the equipment. This can help smooth out your financial statements to reflect how your business actually runs. Regardless of how you feel about numbers, these are some of the essential things you should know about accounting. In the beginning, when you have fewer transactions and they are for the most part straightforward, it’s generally clear what’s what. But as your business grows and your financial transactions become increasingly complex, look into taking on a CFO who has a proven track record of financial expertise or consult a professional accountant for advice.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bookkeeping-615384_960_720-600x400.jpg","August 28, 2017","en",0.997320234775543,0.542778074741364,0.247699782252312,0.0477877967059612,0.161734327673912
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/04/spotlight-conversation-myounghee-jo-building-brand-generate-new-business/","ImpactHub","Building your brand: A conversation with Myounghee Jo"," Myounghee Jo has been working as a graphic designer for over ten years. She has worked with numerous clients throughout her career ranging from Fortune 500 companies to local artists. But to get to where she is today as a well-respected independent freelancer, she had to build her own personal brand from the ground up. Jo was gracious enough to take time out of her busy schedule to talk about the importance of building your personal brand, the problems she faced along the way, and her growing desire to express another part of herself. How did you start building your personal brand? My personal brand is something I had to discover through a long process that took several years. When I first started, I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was constantly questioning myself. What am I doing? Why am I doing this? I think that’s true of a lot of people so I’m no exception. I needed to find out who I was and what I thought was important. How did you go from there to where you are now? It all came together when I did my Master’s Degree in Graphic Design Communication. What resonated with me was how through the work that you do, it’s about the story behind what you’re doing, how you communicate to others, how you present yourself to others, and how others see you. Another thing was something one of my first managers said to me which was that when you design something, you always need a reason. There’s a truth to all of it. Once I figured this out, I was ready to start building. How did you find your first clients? When I first started, it was very different to how it is now. Now you can quite easily design a website and leverage social media channels such as a blog, Instagram, or Facebook to reach potential clients. Back then, when I first started, it was before social media. I was printing things out on paper, showing people, and trying to get feedback. While this method helped in the early stages, pretty soon after, it was clear that a website would be the best way to build my brand, showcase my portfolio, and demonstrate what I can do. I also applied for tons of jobs at agencies and entered a lot of competitions just to build up some experience and meet people. What standards and values do you associate with your brand? Kindness. Being kind is extremely important to me, whether it’s personal or professional. Honesty, is another one. Being straightforward and clear with what is to be expected. Perfectionism. I want everything to be perfect so when I say I want to do this, you’re going to get complete and total commitment from me from beginning to end. And through this work ethic, I’ve earned a lot of trust with my clients who come back and tell their friends and associates about me. Was there a time when your brand wasn’t resonating? How did you re-position yourself to generate new business? Having developed my brand in London, it worked a bit differently compared to here in Vienna. When I moved here, it was difficult to find clients. In London, people don’t hesitate to contact you and take a chance on you if they see your work and like it. It’s more open; people reach out and there’s a response. Here, you have to know someone. It’s more a referral system. People trust other people more than they trust the work itself. If a potential client sees your work and likes it, if they don’t know someone who knows you, they won’t contact you. So, here in Vienna, networking is extremely important. You absolutely have to leverage your network to find new business. What tips do you have for anyone who is in the process of building their personal brand? You should take the time to find out what you really want to do and what you want to show others. Find the parts of yourself that you want to share with the world and build off of that. It might sound a bit abstract but it’s really not; you can even do something as simple as writing a list: things you like and things you don’t like. Strike out the things you don’t like and focus on the things you do. Build your brand from there. What’s the next step? How is your brand evolving? I’m actively developing another aspect of myself which is my passion for food. It’s not a re-branding of myself but the development of a parallel brand if you will. To me, cooking is about designing and creating valuable food that incorporates important concepts like zero waste or slow food. There needs to be a reason behind it. That’s why I want to take JoJo in the Kitchen as far as it can go. Our relationship to food is extremely important and cooking is a part of myself that I absolutely need to share with the world. Are you prepared, in a sense, to start over again with JoJo in the Kitchen? After going through the building of my graphic design business, I feel very prepared to tackle this challenge. Having worked in various marketing and communications departments over the years, I’ve learned the things that are necessary in order to launch a brand so while the food community is still new to me, the strategies involved are similar. I don’t feel like I’m starting from scratch this time. I know what it takes, I know what I want to achieve, and I’m confident that I can make it happen. Have you planned for any potential difficulties? What challenges do you see for yourself? Time. It will take time. Building brands always takes time. I’d like it to go quicker but you can’t always control this kind of thing. There’s also always going to be setbacks but you have to keep pushing forward. One of the more interesting challenges to me is how do I present myself? Am I Jo the graphic designer or am I Jo the food entrepreneur? I’ve learned over the past few months that I need to address my audience and fulfill their expectations. I need to separate Jo the graphic designer and Jo the food entrepreneur even though they are both important parts of me. Simplicity at the end of the day is highly effective so to say I’m a graphic designer and a food entrepreneur, for some people, that’s just too dissonant. Do you think it’ll be easier this time around? I think so. I hope so! Like I said before, I’m definitely confident that I can do it. I just need to be patient and be more relaxed–to try to do the things that I can do when I can do them. I’m still a perfectionist though so it’s about being easier on myself! How can people help? If anyone wants to show their support, come to an upcoming JoJo in the Kitchen event!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jo-Interview-Banner-photo-600x400.jpg","September 4, 2017","en",0.996119141578674,0.00206540385261178,0.585237830877304,0.00609797216020525,0.406598821282387
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/11/5-skills-master-survive-future-business-world/","ImpactHub","5 Skills You Should Master to Survive in the Future Business World","It’s no secret that the future of work is changing: the days of working at a respectable company until you can afford to build your dream home and retire with a comfortable pension are over. Massive change is coming our way. Extreme longevity, unbridled population growth, the explosion of information flows, globally connected worlds, huge technological progress, big data, the rise of smart machines, and the advent of artificial intelligence are all quickly becoming a reality. The very nature of work might change forever. According to the World Economic Forum, in merely five years from now, over one-third of skills that are considered important in today’s workforce will have become obsolete. How are we supposed to brave these fundamental transformations? Even more so, how can we harness them to drive our business to success? 1) Embrace change The first rule of the future business world is not to resist the transformations to come. Don’t expect to grow old in one particular sector. Faced with many new challenges, we must be ready to adapt and evolve. Transitions can be very scary but they will prove necessary. Don’t be the one who drowns on the sinking ship merely because you were too afraid to jump into the cold water. In order to stay competitive, it is essential to equip yourself with a diverse skill set that is relevant as well as highly transferable to different fields. Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Be inquisitive. Be prepared to unlearn what you took for granted. Open yourself to new learning experiences. Remain on the lookout for new trends and big drivers, be it technological or socio-economic. Stay willing to continue learning far beyond the years of formal education. Evaluate which skills will push you ahead and will give you a competitive edge. Then, relentlessly pursue them. 2) Get creative All signs point to the rising importance of creative skills. A well-known IBM survey of over 1500 CEOs from across the globe actually cited creativity as the single most important characteristic of tomorrow’s leading organizations. Robots will quickly surpass our abilities to do manual labour if they have not already done so. Hence, there will be a rising demand for the kinds of skills machines are not good at. A robot might be able to produce cars much more efficiently than we do, but will it ever be able to invent an entirely unprecedented concept of mobility? Proficiency in higher-level adaptive thinking and creativity will be the foundation of success. Computers will always beat us at coming up with rules-based solutions by simply churning massive amounts of data. It is with out-of the box thinking that we can prevail. 3) Value transdisciplinarity Another way to create a competitive edge for yourself or your business is to develop a broad set of proficiencies across multiple disciplines. In the past, acquiring expertise in a specific field was a straight path to success. Alas, specialization will only get you so far in today’s world. Many of the current global problems are simply too complex to be solved by one discipline. This translates directly into the business world. The more complex the challenge ahead, the more likely you are to overcome it through unorthodox thinking. The ideal profile that will almost certainly boost your business or career is ’T-shaped’. This means that your skills cover a broad range of disciplines in which you are proficient but still offer deep specialized knowledge in one of them. Especially in a business environment where you can be certain to embark on different ventures throughout your career, the T-shaped profile of transdisciplinarity is a lifesaver. 4) Cultivate Empathy Empathy lies at the heart of 21st-century work. Why? Because empathy is the key to successful collaboration. The software company Atlassian recently sponsored a study on the future teamwork. Their results are telling. 90% of companies stated that they are working on problems so complex they simply can’t be solved by individuals. Teams are a requirement. Yet, 75% of teams report being dysfunctional. So before even worrying about AI and robots taking over, we should take a hard look at how we can solve our basic human deficiencies. So what does it take to develop an empathetic working style? According to Dr. Brene Brown, a leading researcher on vulnerability and empathy, empathy consists of four qualities: the ability to take the perspective of another person, staying away from judgment, recognizing emotion in others, and communicating that emotion. Working on those skills will go a long way. 5) Hone your cross-cultural competency Linked tightly to the last point is cross-cultural competency. This will become an important skill for us all, not just those people who have to operate in diverse geographical environments. Organizations have come to see diversity as an immense asset as it works as a driver of innovation. Research has shown that the more diverse a group, i.e. in terms of age, skills, disciplines, working and thinking styles, the more innovative they are. Scott E. Page, professor and director of the Center of the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that diverse groups outperform like-minded experts. Yet, diversity is a double-edged sword. The innovative potential of diversity can be compromised if people cannot overcome their individual differences at the work space. In order to transcend these differences and collaborate effectively, we need to learn how to navigate in culturally and socially diverse settings. We need to learn how to create cohesion between our team members by identifying and communicating points of connection, such as shared goals. In the end, our best chance to be successful in the future world of work is finding a venture that lies at the intersection of what we are deeply passionate about and where your talents lie. Combine this with the skills listed in this article and you are weathered for any storm to come. It ultimately all boils down to one question. What will you learn today that will make you more valuable tomorrow?","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/future-2372183_1280-600x400.jpg","September 11, 2017","en",0.990907549858093,0.00107249614666216,0.593006730079651,0.00830721401143819,0.397613599896431
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/13/productivity-on-the-road/","ImpactHub","Productivity on the Road","Sometimes, you cannot avoid work and it follows you on your travels, whether is at a conference or at the beach. And without a dedicated space or routine it can be difficult to get your entire to-do list accomplished. That is okay. We are here to help. We have the tools and tips to help you be productive while you are away from home – whether it is on the beach in the city or on an extended vacation. Day In Day Out The first thing you need while working away from your home, city, or favourite Impact Hub is a routine. You need to establish times that you will work. Routines can be difficult to establish when you are away from home, and we all know this to be true. One option for setting a routine is to get work tasks done before plans for the day start. It can be a relief to get work out of the way at the beginning rather than having it hang over your head for the whole day of that exciting conference you are attending. Setting up time when your work contacts can reach you is also important for establishing a routine. It will help set working times aside from vacation activities, conference dinners, or any other reason you might be travelling and have to work.This will also create a sense of accountability in your day because other people will be counting on you to answer your phone or email. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you planned. You can’t work in the hotel room because your early morning will cause your partner to wake up too early (they might actually be on vacation). Or you walked twenty kilometres the day before and have no desire to get up early. Or the plans for the day start at the time that you would normally have set aside to work. Which means you need to be flexible and realistic with your work expectations. Or you just need to go somewhere else and get everything on your list accomplished for the day. There is no place like home – or is there? We all have limited options when staying in someone else’s house or in a hotel. The desk and the uncomfortable chair that is supposed to be your office while away is rarely appealing. Coffee shops while comfortable, and have a ready supply of caffeine, often have unreliable internet connections. So where can you go? It has to be somewhere that you know you can work well in. Somewhere that has a ready supply of caffeinated beverages. Somewhere comfortable with a reliable internet connection. And somewhere that isn’t isolated from other people. Fortunately, Impact Hub has you covered! You are already an Impact Hub Member. Just go to the local Impact Hub. Which is slightly more difficult in Canada as Ottawa is currently the only one in that vast landmass. Impact Hub Ottawa As an Impact Hub Vienna member, you get 3 days a year for free at any Impact Hub in the world. Regardless of whether you are off to Amsterdam or Zagreb there is always a place to work. And trust us, it is a home away from home. Recently while away, I spent a day at Impact Hub Ottawa. I met James Chan, the Programming Lead, who graciously showed me where they kept the tea and coffee, introduced me to members in Ottawa, and gave me the internet password. I also met Vita Sgardello, the Community Lead, who told me about their tradition of “brown bag lunches”. This is where people bring their own lunch to a short lecture given by one of the community members. On that day, it was how to camp for free in Ontario. The Impact Hub in Ottawa is fantastic. Everyone is super welcoming and It was a relaxing space in which to work. Just like Vienna. Portable Projects Sometimes, entrepreneurs and freelancers of all types can feel a bit like being an office hobo. You pack up a few things in your bindle for the day and off you go. Being close to your home means your resources are always within reach. However, when you are on the road this is another issue entirely. While the majority of your work is probably stored on a laptop or tablet you still access books, people, and other physical resources on an almost daily basis. This means finding ways to make it electronic or to condense it realistically. This might mean downloading books that you need for a project on your tablet – either from the library, on-line booksellers or through accessing materials that are no longer under copyright with Google Books. This also might mean that if you need a drafting table to design your next bag or product it might be better left for your return. Portability also means choosing projects that can be realistically completed while you are travelling. Final thoughts You are travelling and away. Which means that you should also enjoy the reason that you find yourself in another city (or on the beach in Vienna). Don’t despair that you aren’t getting all your work done.Pack up all your portable work and head out to the nearest Impact Hub.Relax, you will definitely be productive on your travels.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/18/spotlight-conversation-sabine-kampmuller-afya/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Sabine Kampmüller of AFYA"," Sabine Kampmüller is the founder of AFYA, an organization that works on intercultural health promotion. Their current mission is to support children and adolescents who suffer from post-traumatic stress. Prior to founding AFYA, Sabine worked for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for 20 years. After several years abroad doing field work in Africa and other parts of the world, she settled in the MSF offices in Vienna to tackle global health issues and work on organisational learning. Currently in the midst of setting up AFYA, Sabine took some time to sit down and talk about her organization, what motivates her, and the future she wants to see. What made you start AFYA? AFYA is directly linked to where I come from professionally. It was a privilege to work for MSF, but it was time to do something new. The last few years, with all the migrants and refugees arriving in Austria, I see new and different health needs and these needs are not being covered by the existing health system. Given our extensive first-hand experience of working in health and intercultural settings, my colleagues at AFYA and I feel that we have something to contribute. We want to offer our expertise and do something to address the current problems that we see. What does AFYA stand for? AFYA is not an acronym. The word means health and well-being in Arabic and Kiswahili. Kiswahili was my first working language in Kenya so that’s why I chose AFYA as the name for the organization. I feel that mental health is an important issue in the refugee population. A big proportion of people have experienced trauma either from the conflict in their home country or during their journey here. There aren’t any hard numbers because nobody has studied this but from experience, and from working with different groups, the estimate is that at least half of refugees and migrants have significant post-traumatic stress reactions. This issue is an important link to Austrian expectations on integration because this is such a large obstacle to integration. A young Afghan I met recently summed up his experience: “In order to learn, I need peace in my mind.” He stopped school because his head wasn’t calm enough. We need to do something about this as a society. What is intercultural health? How would you define it? Intercultural health ensures that the different backgrounds of people are taken into consideration in the provision of health care. It tries to bridge the gap between people’s needs, concepts, and perceptions, and the existing health service. Concerning mental health, this means that we allow different cultural explanations of what is wrong without judging these ways of dealing with psychological issues as long as they are not harmful. We build on the respective understanding and we offer information and solutions based on medical evidence. It’s about mobilizing people’s own resources and capacities to deal with trauma first. What’s wrong with the current health system with regards to mental health? Let’s be clear, the Austrian health system is very good, but it’s a specialized health system; it’s very focused on curative and hospitalized care. Right now, there is psychotherapy and psychiatric care, but the entry level to access these services is very high. You have to have very serious problems before you get support. Organisations such as Hemayat do excellent work offering psychotherapy with cultural mediators, but their waiting lists are long and many people don’t get there in the first place. Our approach is to complement this with primary support and ensuring that the entry level is low. Our work is not therapeutic but aims at strengthening coping mechanisms. We go to the homes where unaccompanied minors live and teach them “recovery techniques”. We try to make their difficulties easy to understand. We want to prevent very serious problems before they happen. How has your work with MSF and the work you do now affected you? The work I did with MSF has definitely made me very humble. There are many things in life that we often take for granted such as security and the freedom to move and speak that I have learned to appreciate. It was such an exciting experience to see so many different ways of livings and so many different dreams and experiences. It’s only fed into my curiosity to find out more about other people’s history and stories. I have also learned that a culture of reflection is important. Humanitarian work is becoming more complex and with the increase in complexity, we need to be more agile, make use of what we’ve learned, and think of how can we improve going forward. What are some of the difficulties you’re facing? The biggest challenge is funding, of course, especially as a new organization. It’s very difficult to get into the appropriate channels, but we’re working on it. Have you encountered any resistance to the work that you do? This is a new field and it could be seen as competition to traditional psychotherapy even if what we do is not therapy. Even though we clearly make that distinction, I’m anticipating a level of questioning concerning whether we are all qualified to do the work that we do. The program is designed to largely run with trained native speakers under good supervision. Our aim is to enable kids and adolescents to use the tools that we teach them to take control of their stress reactions. We don’t delve into trauma or what happened. It’s about teaching and practicing techniques to take charge of your own emotions. Why do you do this kind of work? I was always curious about other countries and cultures. As a child, I was inspired by an uncle of mine who was a development worker. My most exciting childhood memories were him coming back and talking about the work he did in Papua New Guinea and Africa. I simply like to work on improving things and making things better. I think mental health is one of the big challenges in our society today. I find it exciting that we have a much more diverse people here today in Austria, and it’s full of opportunities. I don’t want to interpret this diversity as a problem–it’s an opportunity. And if we want to utilize this opportunity, we need to overcome obstacles. What would you like to see AFYA become? I want AFYA to be the leading organization when it comes to intercultural health issues. I want us to develop lots of new programs and be a very agile organization that really contributes to the health and well-being of refugees and migrants in Austria. What impact would you like to see AFYA have? I really want to see that we’ve enabled a few hundred kids, adolescents and adults to gain control over their post-traumatic stress in the next few years. I believe that’s doable. On a more political level, I would like to see the issue of mental health higher on the agenda so we can mobilize additional attention and resources towards it. How can members of Impact Hub help? Contribute ideas! What we need now are connections to groups and communities who are in need of our services. This is already happening but we welcome more connections. There are some practical things as well: setting up the organization and translation among other things. I’ll be asking for help!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sabine-Kampmüller-600x400.jpg","September 18, 2017","en",0.988975763320923,0.18461529049091,0.6180719435215,0.0172625970153604,0.180050127208233
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/20/resources-for-women-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Resources for Women Entrepreneurs","Over the last decade, women have made significant headway in the field of entrepreneurship. Studies show that 49% of all 6900 new one-person businesses in Vienna in 2017 were started by women and around 33% of Austrian companies are led by women. While we’re leaps and bounds ahead of where we were only ten years ago, we still have a long way to go. Women still receive significantly less investment capital to fund their enterprises and must continue to battle stereotypes as they launch and grow their startup. Thankfully, we’ve begun to see targeted, well-structured support programs for female entrepreneurs popping up in Austria and internationally that help to provide women with the training, support, and network they need to be successful. We put together this list of some of the most relevant resources for women who want to start or grow their businesses: Women in Business Women in Business is a contact partner within the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber for female entrepreneurs. They foster networking among female entrepreneurs by arranging lectures and seminars, providing information on current topics and practical advice—for example on how to improve negotiation skills and leadership. They also give support by temporarily offering replacement of the female entrepreneur in case she unable to work in the event of an accident or during maternity leave. You can check their website here. Female Founders Female Founders is a platform created and directed by three women with experience in the Austrian startup scene. The organization is dedicated to helping female entrepreneurs connect with their peers while providing mentorship opportunities. They also offer seminars and a “Bootcamp” which is a 10-week program where you will learn how to start or to continue your business with support and lectures from entrepreneurs and highly-motivated business founders. You can check this website here. Business Professional Women This is one of the most influential international networks of business and professional women with affiliates in 95 countries across five continents. The aim of BPW is to enable women to sustain themselves economically. In addition, BPW offers personal development programs for members such as mentoring, leadership training and e-Business training. Their projects aim to protect female rights, help them to overcome their limitations, and create a nurturing environment for development. You can check their website here. Female Leader Initiative (FELIN) FELIN is an independent network of women created by female leaders. Their aim is to help highly qualified women in Styria get into leadership positions. FELIN offers targeted activities for companies and organizations. It also features a network that allows women to get in touch with each other. Although only available in German, since they target specifically female entrepreneurs in Styria, it is worth checking out if you’re starting up in the area. Visit their site here. WINGS WINGS is an international project founded in 2014 and co-financed by the European Commission. Their main goal is to unite initiatives undertaken by female entrepreneurs and provide them with a European network for those who want to support or be engaged in female entrepreneurial activities. WINGS builds effective and efficient female entrepreneurship ecosystems, as well as supporting and integrating sustainable entrepreneurship programs. It is an excellent tool for women who are planning to start a business and for those who already have one and want to network and meet more people or mentors who can help them develop and grow their venture through events, online courses and more. Their online platform is very user-friendly and even allows you to create your own personal online shop in easy-to-follow steps. It also contains a vast quantity of mentors around Europe that you can contact for free. We recommend trying their website. Honorable mentions These two websites also provide interesting content and articles that address a lot of topics that are interesting for female entrepreneurs: Ladies Who Launch and Women 2.0. It’s exciting to see the opportunities and success stories of women founders who are being supported through platforms and associations like these. While there is still far to go in terms of how we support and encourage female entrepreneurship, these resources certainly help provide women with key tools they need to help them build a network of support, tap into personal motivation, learn business competencies, and grow their businesses.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/10/02/interview-questions-for-your-first-hire/","ImpactHub","Interviewing for your First Employee: A Guide","—You have worked hard. You had a brilliant idea, wrote a proposal, networked with investors, secured funding, promoted your business, and now your start-up needs to grow. You need to hire someone to handle your more complex finances, someone to manage your supply chain, or someone to handle your back-office work. Whatever your need there is someone out there. However, you want to make sure you get the right fit. The right person, who shares your values and the understands the mission you are on. Someone committed to your success. That is where interviewing comes into play. We know that this is a daunting task, so, we thought we would help you out with a guide to interviewing your first employee. I used to work in Human Resources in a large organization. We recruited thousands of people a year. Everything from PhD research physicists and physicians to clerical and cleaning staff. We had to assure the fit for the organization and the individual team. This is difficult to do without properly performing an interview process. Step 1: The Posting The interview process starts with the posting. This is where you your ideal candidate’s profile. This covers everything from education and experience to individual attributes. Postings are also a way to attract the ideal candidate to you. A well-crafted posting will have the right individuals select themselves into your recruitment process. For candidates wanting to work with you this is the first step in them interviewing you. Yes, this process works both ways. This is your first opportunity to sell yourself and your business to the right candidates. Postings should include your expectations for education and experience, e.g. do you require someone a university degree in finance? Do they need experience working in the financial sector? How much? What type of finance – corporate, banking, NGO, charitable? They should also include the skills and abilities you need. Deciding this is not as easy as the more objective education and experience. Will your new employee be supervised directly? If you answered no then you need someone who can work well on their own. A motivated self-starter. Do you need someone to sell your product? Then you need someone who can manage customers and has good communication skills. Step 2: Crafting your Interview Questions This is not as difficult as it sounds. I promise. You need to achieve balance between a technical skills test and fit. Some questions will have to be about their technical competence. These are questions like: “How would you create a taxonomy to identify key customer trends in unstructured data?” You are the best person to determine these questions as this is your area of expertise. And you also know the answers. The questions concerning fit are another issue entirely. Gone are the days of “if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?” Besides the ridiculous answers that you get about being an oak with strong roots and branches to shelter everything from passing storms it tells you nothing about the candidate sitting in front of you. A former director of mine once said “the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour”. This means that you need to ask behavioural questions about what they have done as opposed to hypothetical questions. Hypothetical behavioural questions can be turned easily into ideal questions: Example: Current Question: What would you do if you had a conflict with a customer? Better Question: Tell me about a time that you were in a conflict situation with a customer. What did you do? What would you do differently? What did you learn from the experience? The “better question” is much more elucidating. This gives you greater insight into the candidate’s behaviours and thought processes. Always remember to write your ideal answers down. You will need them to make a grading rubric so that you can compare the answers that candidates give you to the ideal and score their responses. Step 3: The Interview Today is the day. You have looked through hundreds of applications. You selected the best five and they are all coming in today. You made your interview question sheets with your answer rubric so that you can record everything as the interview progresses. All you need to do is start the interview. The first step in this case is to put the candidate at ease. They are nervous. You are going to throw a lot of questions at them about their technical expertise and their personality. They have been practicing and they want to get it right. You just need to start with “hello, and how are you?” or give them a few minutes to centre themselves in their physical and headspace by describing a bit about yourself, your company, and your vision for the future. Then dive into the questions. While the candidate is answering, take notes. Lots of notes. Ask questions to clarify anything you do not understand. This is important as it shows the candidate that you value them and are listening. When you are finished with your questions it is always a good idea to ask if they have any questions. They are interviewing you too. This gives the candidate an opportunity to find out a little more about who you are and what you are offering. This is also a great opportunity to assess them. The questions asked also give insight into character. If one asks about dress code that could be someone who wants to comply with rules. If one asks about what type of manager you are the information being sought is your management and delegation style. Final Thoughts Just follow this simple process and you will soon be looking at how to on-board your first employee.

Florian Übelacker, Chief Commercial Officer of primeCROWD and Lena Gansterer, Co-Founder of IRP, sat down to talk about what’s special about the new partnership, working together, and the benefits for entrepreneurs. Could you tell us a little bit more about primeCROWD? Florian: We are an Angel-crowd investing platform and help selected startups to get funding–we vet them, we present them to our investors, and ultimately our mission is to enable startups to pursue their dreams. That’s what we stand for. What will this new partnership look like? Florian: Good ideas arise in liquid networks where cooperation and openness is valued more than protection. Our partnership will focus on this ethos through co-hosting events, raising awareness, and coaching and mentoring startups by helping them overcome hurdles, spark new ideas, have fun, and ideally also get funding. Lena: Our ambitions and vision for this partnership are the same. Right now, the focus of the partnership is the Investment Ready Program and getting entrepreneurs access to the right investors. Many of the entrepreneurs we work with are social entrepreneurs who are looking for investors interested in impact investing. Partnering with networks such as primeCROWD helps us to have access to investors that our startups might not otherwise meet. Why is this an exciting opportunity for entrepreneurs who take part in IRP? Lena: Throughout the program, entrepreneurs receive a great deal of expertise, support, and guidance from mentors affiliated with Impact Hub Vienna. primeCROWD is now joining our expert pool and will support entrepreneurs from day one in the program. It’s really the best of both worlds. Florian: Exactly but not only that, our network of investors is a very inclusive network. Since the return on social impact investments can be considered equal to standard investments, these kinds of investments are not just for impact investors–it makes sense for traditional investors to look at these opportunities too so we facilitate these relationships. Social ventures can offer attractive returns. It’s not just about the cause. What kind of guidance and support can IRP participants expect from this partnership? Florian: We are here to help entrepreneurs, who have traded financial security and stability for uncertainty, to navigate successfully through this very period of uncertainty. We work a lot with investors so we have a very clear understanding of what they value and know more often than not down to the individual level what an investor likes. We can help entrepreneurs by showing them what kind of questions they can expect from specific investors and thus what pitches they should use. Lena: We partner with several investor networks and primeCROWD really has a special network in Austria and the know-how about how to structure a co-investment deal. Co-investment deals lower the risk of early-stage investments for the first investors and therefore are an important tool for the entrepreneurs we work with in the Investment Ready Program. How can people learn more about this opportunity? Lena: Join the Impact Hub network! Sign up for the next Investment Ready Program! Florian: Pick up the phone! Give us a call, tell us your story, and why we should care. We will listen.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Working-Together-Impact-Hub-Vienna-and-primeCrowd-Banner-600x400.jpg","October 9, 2017","en",0.987077593803406,3.18175880238414e-05,0.944656372070312,0.000134060697746463,0.0551777482032776
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/10/18/crowd-investor-spotlight-interview-with-verena-ringler/","ImpactHub","[Crowd Investor Spotlight] Interview with Verena Ringler","Get to know the crowd investors who support impact Hub Vienna in our new Crowd Investor Spotlight Series Verena Ringler advises policymakers and stakeholders on the EU’s future and EU’s role in the world. She is driven by her conviction that European integration is too good to fail – internally as well as globally. She is trained and experienced in diplomacy, multi-stakeholder EU processes, and international quality journalism.Read this interview in German ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Verena Ringler can be called an activist of the “Erasmus generation”. She firmly believes in the underlying potential, necessity, and resilience of transnational cooperation in Europe. Across the continent, she scouts for individuals, identifies groups, and spots trends concerning Europe’s societal and political developments. The Impact Hub has since its inception been one of her pools of potential stakeholders and interlocutors. This is why Verena Ringler supports the hub as a Crowd Investor. According to her, “there is a Viennese public life before the Impact Hub– and a Vienna with the Impact Hub.” “Doing things differently in order to do different things” is what informs Verena Ringler’s approach to hands-on work on European integration. She suspects that this is also part of the response to the challenges of our time, such as youth unemployment in southern Europe, the immense loss of trust due to the Eurozone crisis, migration policy, climate policies, or participation in democracy. For Verena, these challenges are here not to be circumvented, ignored, or belittled—they are here to be tackled. Since 2013, she has been devising and realizing a large number of projects in the Europe Cluster of Stiftung Mercator, a private foundation. In her projects, she identifies practical interventions at the politics-society interface. They range from the “Mercator European Dialogue” – a backchannel platform for national members of parliaments across borders—all the way to “Rethink Europe” at the European Council on Foreign Relations. As a Crowd Investor of the Impact Hub Vienna, Verena not only supports the hub but also shares her thoughts on its long-term role. Why do you support the Impact Hub? I am happy to support the Impact Hub, which serves as both a space and a place here in Vienna, Austria. People with different backgrounds and from different fields work together towards the future. To me, what’s enticing about the Impact Hub is that all its members – while working on different things, in different branches – seem to be great friends of the future, no matter how uncertain that might be. How would you describe the Impact Hub? The Impact Hub resembles an ecosystem. Someone has planted seeds, and tending these ideas leads to a variety of different outcomes. What are your hopes and expectations for the Impact Hub? One man’s antagonist is another man’s policy advisor. In this respect, the Impact Hub, based on the experience it has gained in its first few years, could turn from a taker of the policy agenda to a co-shaper of Austria’s policy agenda. It’s quite fascinating to see the Impact Hub turn, step by step, into an Impact Advocate; members of the Impact Hub would thus become experts on social impact. Slowly and surely then, they would inject themselves into Austria’s political life. They would understand, prepare, represent and advance the interests and themes of contemporary initiatives in Austria, who are often non-governmental, non-profit, one-person in their set-up. What does impact mean to you? For me, impact is when, after an activity or a project, people emerge differently than how they were when they started. When an activity or project creates an internal or external transformation. In your opinion, what is the contribution of institutions such as the Impact Hub to social development? I suspect that the potential reach of the Impact Hub is huge because the Impact Hub sits like a cluster of future-minded individuals and initiatives in the center of Vienna’s public life. There are certainly match-making or synergy effects that Impact Hub can trace from the beginning to their end, but there are many more such contributions that are not yet even documented, or traced. Just visit the Impact Hub for one day and document how many guests, partners, and newcomers walk in an out—they walk out with more access to information, players, and markets. They profit from efficiency and spillover gains, from knowledge transfer and indirect contacts. In your recent lecture “Reaching for the Stars” at the Vorarlberg “Days of Utopia” festival you spoke about the “non-profit single European market”. What is that, what should happen? Today the EU developed a single market for capital, goods and services, employers and employees. But there is no single market for the non-profit sector. An NGO still needs to register in all EU Member States if it wants to operate all over. The same applies to donors and foundations. And yet: If we all think we do need a non-profit single market in order to lift our impact, we need to realize that it’s us we have been waiting for. We must learn to fight politically for our own playing field – to research ourselves and build expertise, to contact MPs, to convince them to forge alliances, and to advocate relentlessly for a European association statute that works for all, from Finland to Portugal. Or, consider a whole other field, the field of the EU budget. Why not pilot with participative budgeting e.g. in some regional and youth funding lines, and thus bring citizens to the table from the beginning of a budgeting process? Why not use EU taxpayers’ money efficiently and effectively? Why not dream of a group, say, the Impact Hub and its friends, to inject themselves into the negotiations for the next EU’s multiannual financial framework? Why not advocate for a first “Citizens Million,” i.e. one million euros of EU money that citizens could program themselves in a joint, participatory process? Where do you see Impact Hub Vienna in 10 years? I guess once the Impact Hub has also become an Impact Advocate, the next step would be embarking on “Impact Research.” So, the Impact Hub could undertake empirical research on society and economics in Austria. It would work together with international research groups. It could address overarching or cross-cutting questions of social impact and thus of values, the economy, and society.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/10/30/validate-business-idea/","ImpactHub","How to validate a business idea","You’ve got a new business idea, and you think it’s got great potential. Awesome! But how do you know anyone will spend their hard-earned cash on your product? Validating your business idea early and often is key to launching a successful product or service. Here are a few ideas on how to get started. Clearly define the problem you’re solving and for whom First things first. You may love your idea, but if it’s not solving a problem or need for your prospective customer, you’re going to have a hard time convincing anybody to purchase it. Start by talking to as many people as you can in your target audience and listen carefully to their answers. Why do they need this product? How will it make their lives easier? The key to this phase is to remove your ego and assumptions from the process so you can be as receptive as possible to their input. Need help to determine if you’re solving for the right problem? Check out this article from Harvard Business Review. Analyze the competition While you may ultimately choose to ignore what the competition is doing and go your own route as so many startups in Silicon Valley suggest, it would be foolish not to at least inform yourself of what is happening in your industry and niche. Not only will investors want to know that you’re up to speed on the competition, but you need to be firmly convinced that the value you’re creating isn’t being solved for elsewhere. That’s not to say that you can’t enter a market that already has established players—but if you plan to do so, you need to understand what your unique selling proposition is that goes above and beyond what’s already on the market (or segments it in a targeted way). Build a prototype Start with a small budget and put together something concrete that you can begin to adapt. It’s very rare that your product or service will be perfect in its first form. You’ll likely need to go through several iterations before you find a solution that satisfies your ideal consumer, so consider validation just part of the development process. Set aside some capital so you can invest in responding to the validation work you’re about to embark on. Find beta testers It might be tough to expose your idea at first, but if you want it to become a reality, you need to engage some beta testers. Seek out a few of those folks you engaged in the first stage of this process and let them give you feedback on your first attempt. One word of advice here, if you’re going to share your product or service with friends or family, take their feedback with a grain of salt. Ultimately, they may not be your ideal customer. If that’s the case, then be careful about incorporating their ideas into the next iteration of your product. In this phase, your customer is the only one that truly matters. Take advantage of an online community If your idea fits into a niche interest where others are also very passionate, or if you’re looking for some support from fellow people looking to launch an idea, look on Facebook, Reddit, or other online communities for appropriate groups where you can openly discuss your idea and get some feedback. Check out this list of product testing sites where you can get users to review and respond to your product or idea. Again, same rules apply. Responses from your ideal customer should take priority over all others. Launch a mini-campaign Test interest in your product by launching a mini-campaign to your targeted user-group before you actually release the product. You can do this by creating a landing page that describes your product and asking people to sign up and stay informed on when the launch happens. The thought leaders at Moz put together this whiteboard Friday video to provide you with some guidelines on how to best execute this strategy. We hope you found these strategies on how to validate your business idea helpful! Best of luck as you take your first step into entrepreneurship.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Validate-your-business-idea-care-banner-600x400.jpg","October 30, 2017","en",0.997143149375916,0.30389204621315,0.339262545108795,0.0601274147629738,0.296718001365662
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/06/spotlight-conversation-dimitrios-prodromou-humanizing-technologies/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Dimitrios Prodromou of Humanizing Technologies"," Dimitrios Prodromou is the Co-Founder and Chief Technical Officer of Humanizing Technologies, a company that advises, sells, and develops applications for social robots. Their current focus is Pepper, the most advanced humanoid robot available on the market today. The company is growing rapidly and every day is a jam-packed work day but Dimitrios was able to step away for a few minutes to talk to us about his company, Pepper, and the ambition he has for his company’s future. What made you start Humanizing Technologies? I’ve worked in robotics now for over 13 years. Last year I met Tim Schuster (Co-Founder and CEO of Humanizing Technologies) and we decided to combine forces: his business know-how with my skills in robotics. We’re a perfect match! And we chose to pursue this idea of humanizing robots starting with Pepper. What is the goal of your company? The goal is to not just have more human-like robots but to have robots that benefit and complement humanity. This is what’s called social robotics and service robotics. What we ultimately want is for the robot to be a valued assistant or a companion that frees up time for the user to do things that people are more capable of doing—creativity for example. Why now? What makes what you offer important for today? In the last couple of years, there’s been a lot of robots—an automatic vacuum cleaner for example—which were handy but not necessarily socially accepted. But now there’s Pepper, who is socially accepted and most importantly, affordable. Now’s the time because it wasn’t feasible or affordable before. And instead of creating robots that are seen as a threat to people’s livelihoods, we’d like to do the opposite. Can you describe Pepper? Pepper is a humanoid robot or half humanoid because she has wheels instead of legs. She is 120 cm tall and we refer to her as a female because her name is Pepper after Pepper Potts. She’s friendly, petite, cute, has big eyes, and approachable. Right now, I think it’s the most advanced humanoid robot that’s commercially available based on her looks and how advanced the software already is. What are the values that you associate with your company? We are focused on building a good relationship with our customers. We’re not interested in just taking the projects, doing them, and moving on. We build connections to our projects and to our clients. We listen to them and give them what they really need. Empathy is extremely important to us. Have you encountered any difficulties to get to where you are now? Some of the issues we’ve had have been to re-calibrate expectations of what Pepper can and cannot do. Pepper is so advanced that people think that she can do anything and everything. Can she bring me a beer? Can she vacuum? Can she do the dishes? A lot of this current misperception is based on marketing videos which are great to watch but don’t represent reality. It makes the expectations really high. Normally it’s about raising the expectations of the product that you’re offering and we’re having to do the opposite! A good difficulty is that we’re growing really fast. We’re already up to 13 people in two locations: Germany and here in Austria. Managing that growth is a challenge. Given that we’re a really young company, it’s a lot of people very quickly but everyone is incredibly motivated because they found us and believe in what we’re trying to do. What’s next for Humanizing Technologies? We have an upcoming project that’s really exciting. We’re going to use Pepper to help in caregiving for people suffering from dementia. We want to research what the possibilities are. While stopping dementia is out of our hands, we want to see whether we can help slow down the effects of dementia with games or animations being some of the ideas we’re throwing around right now. It’s a long-term project that’s not money-driven but knowledge-driven. We want to use the robot for a good cause. This is what the word humanizing stands for. Doing something with your heart and your mind. What would you like to see your company become? We’re definitely moving down the path we want to be on. It would be good if we can shape the perception that people have towards robots and move further into developing new robots, new hardware and seeing what we can do and how we should use it. We definitely have the right people so it’s all just a matter of time until we get there. What impact would you like to see Humanizing Technologies achieve in the next few years? There’s a lot of different things! With regards to Pepper, we’d like to make her more alive, more intuitive, more functional. Concerning our upcoming project with the elderly, it would be amazing to be able to have a measurable and lasting impact. Right now, given that we haven’t started, we don’t have any concrete ideas about how Pepper is going to communicate with the elderly—we have theories and we’re going to test and we’re going to iterate until we get it right but as of this moment it’s unexplored territory which is exciting! The idea is that Pepper becomes a companion who can recognize and remember and interact with an elderly person in a fluid way. It might sound like a dream but the technology is there. Sometimes you need to push your dreams to get where you need to go. How can members of Impact Hub help? Ideas! We always need ideas. We can always use ideas, input, knowledge, or mentoring. This will never stop! As technicians, we have specific ideas and we go down specific roads and are more often than not preoccupied with the path we have chosen. We don’t think about other possibilities. But from personal experience, someone comes along who has nothing to do with this industry and they have a suggestion for an idea that we never even thought about and it’s great! You might not have the technical skills but you do have the ideas so come talk to us!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-08-at-11.27.17-600x400.png","November 6, 2017","en",0.99457448720932,0.0512280442562769,0.391347676515579,0.0576047717477195,0.499819502234459
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/09/six-essential-tools-for-startup-founders/","ImpactHub","Six Essential Tools for Startup Founders","If you’re about to launch your own startup or you’re already a startup founder, more than likely you’ve seen a lot of rhetoric and received many a sales email about productivity tools for entrepreneurs. It’s true that juggling the many roles of being an entrepreneur is made significantly easier with the help of great technology, but it’s extremely time-consuming and disruptive to constantly transition from one app to another in search of the best solution for your team. When it comes to equipping yourself and your startup with time-saving tech, the best rule to follow is to just keep it simple. Choose options with a low barrier to entry so your team doesn’t have to spend a ton of time training on all the bells and whistles and only implement the ones that will really help your team move the needle, now. You can adopt more sophisticated tech when you really need it. Here is a list of six free or low-cost apps that have been tried and tested by numerous startups and are sure to ease the burden of operating a growing team. Slack When it comes to the successful team management, quick and organized communication is the key. With Slack, you can forget about exhausting email ping-pong and losing your valuable business time. This app allows you to freely organize all team discussions and has all conversations located in the same place. Slack is available in mobile app version allowing you to stay in touch with your team as you’re out on the fundraising trail. Slack offers many additional features for paid users, but free tool version will meet most of the early-stage entrepreneur necessities. Expensify True to their mantra, Expensify make expense reports that don’t suck! Because let’s be honest—organizing and categorizing a stack of business receipts is one of those least-favorite tasks of any founder. Expensify makes the reporting process much easier by allowing you to capture expenses and add them to your report the moment the transaction occurs, so you don’t have to hang onto anything for later. Simple snap a pic of your receipt from your smartphone and add it to your app, and you’ll be saved that dreaded end-of-week task of pulling crumpled receipts from your wallet. Calendly When it comes to scheduling meetings, conferences or business calls, Calendly is a big time-saver. Instead of going through the endless process of picking through your calendar and suggesting times for your appointment, you can simply share a calendar link to others and let them choose a free time slot. After the meeting is booked, the app sends out an automatic invitation to both user calendars. Easy. The basic features of the Calendly app are also free. Upwork When you’re launching a business, you need a wide variety of support. From design work to copy editing to admin work, it’s hard to find a jack-of-all-trades employee who can provide assistance in so many different fields. Instead of hiring employees and taking on the payroll risk, founders might consider hiring freelancers to take on tasks one project at a time. The UpWork app gives you an access to a platform full of professionals in such areas as web and mobile development, writing, design, virtual assistance, customer service reps and more. It makes the hiring process extremely simple and allows you to view ratings and reviews of any hire, so you know the quality of work you can expect. Asana Asana is an easy-to-use and cost-friendly project management tool, that allows the different size of working teams to communicate on projects in one central location and manage all the assets and assignments in one place. The app is straightforward task management and will help you to collaborate on your projects with your team members from any location. They have an assortment of training videos to help get you up to speed quickly, and best of all, it integrates with Slack so you can create tasks from your team conversations. Hellosign As the term sheets start rolling in, Hellosign is a great tool to help you manage signing and scanning documents. It allows you to sign contracts and other legal documents with a legally binding electronic signature. The app is free for up to three documents a month. Your printer ink costs and the environment will thank you. All these apps will allow you to cut the admin work, streamline your communication and project management, and spend more time focusing on what you do best—growing your business.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/21/entrepreneurship-vs-innovation-evening-steve-blank/","ImpactHub","Entrepreneurship and Innovation: An evening with Steve Blank","Photo Credit: Pioneers Steve Blank is one of the key figures behind the Lean Startup movement. He is an icon and pioneer of Silicon Valley, a serial entrepreneur, a bestselling author, a professor, and a prolific thought leader with a wide reach. He has a marked global influence on all things startup, that spans continents, and was recently received to share his thoughts on the startup scene in Vienna. Affable, friendly, and excited to regale the receptive audience at Impact Hub Vienna with his Silicon Valley experiences, Steve Blank explained the mindset and tools needed in order to become a successful entrepreneur. He shared the hard-learned lessons he took to heart during his entrepreneurial days and provided key insights for founders. Here, we’ve put together a list of some of our takeaways from an evening with Steve Blank: 1. Your hypothesis of your customers’ wants on day one is only a guess. Whether it’s your product, customers, pricing, or channels, there are no facts inside your building. You can only learn by leaving the office and talking to your customers. 2. You must build and test a minimum viable product A minimum viable product is not a prototype, but it can lead you to one. It’s whatever you build and gets you the most amount of learning at a point in time. It could be a wireframe or a powerpoint presentation or a spreadsheet. Use it to build layer after layer as you get feedback from customers. 3. The Lean Startup method is not THE method but A method The Lean Startup method grew out of a reaction to everything before it and the belief that startups are just smaller versions of large companies. It is up to us to use it, modify it, and build on it. It’s not supposed to be the endpoint. It’s a springboard to what we’ll learn in the coming years. 4. Just because you have the information, it doesn’t mean you have the wisdom It’s not about smarts. There are some things you just won’t know until you try it and fail. Reading about something isn’t the same as going out there, putting it all on the line, and doing it. 5. Improve your entrepreneurial ecosystem by learning from each other Pay it forward. Share with each other. Ask someone how they screwed up? What would they’ve done differently? Who’s the best VC? Give back to the entrepreneurial ecosystem because creating successful startups and a thriving community requires everyone to participate. Find mentors and when you’re ready, become one yourself. 6. Ask your mentor valuable questions Don’t ask your mentor for answers you could’ve found on Google. Show you did the work and you still need their unique perspective to help with a few things. These conversations are fun and valuable for both parties. 7. Any successful entrepreneur has likely failed at some point Failure is a part of the process. The culture of failure is the nature of startups, and people need to be open and understand that it is key to entrepreneurship. Most startups fail, and you’ll likely feel pretty miserable. But out of the ashes can rise even greater successes. 8. Don’t believe your own bullshit Also known as hubris, Steve Blank was hit by this and it resulted in his greatest disaster. He shared his biggest failure by explaining how he raised 35 million dollars for a video game company, marketed the hell out of it, and lost it all. There were warning signs along the way, but he ignored them. It took him a while to accept what had happened but when he finally did, when he finally reflected on his failure and chose to learn from all the ways it went wrong, that’s when the first seeds of the Lean Startup method came to be which is arguably his greatest success. 9. Show up 80% of entrepreneurship is showing up more than everybody else. Show up for your customers, show up for your investors, and show up for talks and conferences because showing up creates opportunities that you would’ve never found otherwise.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/12/04/spotlight-goood-conversation-georg-woschnagg-claudia-winkler/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: How to be goood! A conversation with Georg Woschnagg and Claudia Winkler"," Georg Woschnagg and Claudia Winkler are Co-Founders of goood, a mobile phone service provider where 10% of your monthly fees are donated to a social cause or charity of your choice. They are off and running in Germany and in Austria and have partnerships with organizations such as Caritas, World Wildlife Fund, and the German Red Cross. Proud, homegrown, and longtime members of Impact Hub Vienna as well as graduates of the Investment Ready Program, goood is all about combining social impact and profit. Georg and Claudia sat down to talk about how it all started, the resistance they faced along the way, and how we can and should shape our future. What made you start goood? Claudia: Around two years ago, I was in a successful career as a telecommunications executive but started to think to myself what’s the purpose of it all? There has to be more to life than making shareholders rich and earning a lot of money. So I took a break from my career, started studying social innovation, helped set up a NGO focused on integration called Fremde werden Freunde, and then six months later I got a call from our Co-Founder Matthias Frenzl about helping to set up goood. It was such a perfect alignment of my skillset and my passion for social causes that I immediately said yes. Georg: It’s funny, I’ve known Claudia for 12 years because we worked for the same company but only briefly did we actually work together. And around the same time as she decided to take a break from her career, I also did the same to stay at home and take care of my kids. I was thinking about them and how one day they would ask me what I did and why which drove me to work in the non-profit sector. And then one day we met up for coffee just as old colleagues and the rest is history. Neither of us had a clue about each other’s interest in social issues. It’s almost cosmic how it all worked out. goood is a transparent social business. What is that and why is that important to you? Georg: We made it our mission from the beginning that from the very first moment a customer engages with goood, we want them to know exactly what’s happening with their hard-earned money. Therefore, there’s no hidden activation fees or gotcha fees to maximize our revenue. We know how to do these things given our experience in the industry but that’s not what we’re about. We wanted first and foremost to create a clean and transparent product and we’ve done that. Second, we want customers to be able to see that 100% of their monthly donation is going to the social cause of their choice. We have nothing to hide so why hide anything? Claudia: We want people to know how our business model works. We want everyone to see where the money comes from and where it’s going. It’s not our intention to get rich with this and we want people to see that. What we want is to create social impact. That’s why we’re here. That’s what’s motivating us. That’s what’s driving us. We’re transparent because that’s how things should be and it shows everyone that what we’re doing works and not just to other startups but to the big corporations as well. What is it about social entrepreneurship that motivates you? Claudia: Purpose. We are motivated by the idea that you can shape your future. We might just be making a small step in the right direction but with enough small steps, the sky’s the limit as they say. Georg: It’s such a worthy challenge to try and combine the profit world and the non-profit world. In our experience, it’s easier to be one or the other. To combine the two is very difficult so we took the hard road. But, we’re extremely proud about what we’ve built because it is truly a marriage of both worlds and it’s socially and economically sustainable. Companies are more often than not faceless legal entities. We want to create a company with a face that contributes to society. How are you able to give 10% of a customer’s monthly fee to a social cause? Georg: We run a very lean operation and are extremely diligent about managing our margins. In order to make our business model work, we have to sacrifice some marketing spend and we have to sacrifice some profit. But like we said before, we’re not doing this to get rich, we’re doing this to create impact and to provide people with an opportunity to contribute to their community through a service they already use. Our goal is to generate 24 million euros in donations within the next five years. Claudia: 10% might sound like a small figure but it can really have an impact. For example, one goood customer can feed a person in Africa in need with their monthly fee. Why is goood important for today’s world? Why now? Claudia: The world is changing. People are looking for ways to change the world and we offer people that possibility. Conscious consumerism is on the rise. Georg: It’s also important for non-profit organizations. They are taking on a lot of challenges and they are also struggling to get the financing they need. The majority of donations are made by people over the age of 70. Younger people often have not enough time or not enough money so we’re trying to make it as simple and as easy as possible for anyone to contribute. What are some of the challenges you’ve had to overcome? Has there been any resistance to your company? Claudia: To our mutual surprise, there was some resistance from the non-profit side. They had some skepticism about our intentions given our past experience in the telecommunications industry so we brought on board people from the non-profit sector and as a result, we completely revamped our business model, built the bridge to the non-profit sector, and that’s what made it all work. Georg: Financing, of course. You’re always walking a fine line. Every startup has this problem and the whole endeavor, because you’re trying to do something different, because you’re breaking all the rules, this creates a high pressure environment which can be challenging for everyone. What impact would you like to see goood have? Claudia: In addition to the social impact we’d like to have, our dream is that when we become profitable, 25% of our profits will be reinvested in other social businesses. And in order to walk the walk and not just talk the talk, 25% of shares of the company are in an association that we hope will one day be a social incubator that will help people get their ideas off the ground. Georg: Some people bring up the idea of competition and ask us what if everyone decides to copy our business model and give back? We just laugh and say that on that day, we’ll know we’ve won. So bring on the competition because nothing would make us happier. How can someone sign up for goood? Are there any costs? Claudia: It’s super easy and it’ll just take three minutes of your time. Go to our German website if you’re in Germany, our Austrian website if you’re in Austria, pick a package, and pick a project. There are no activation fees, no obligations, and you can keep your old number. From the very first day you sign up, you’ll be contributing to your social cause. How can members of Impact Hub help? Georg: Sign up! There’s a special offer code for Impact Hub Members which is: “impacthub”. The first 100 subscribers using this code will get a hardware voucher of 25 euros!

Take this time of year to unplug yourself from your busy day to day and recharge. As connected as we are to our technology, it’s often very difficult for people to unplug. Here are six suggestions to help you disconnect and make your upcoming holidays relaxing, slow, and phone-free: Analog activity day Don’t use a single thing that requires a battery. Play with Legos, play a board game, do a puzzle, do a crossword, do something that requires the use of more than just your amazing opposable thumbs tapping on a screen. Look to do active activities that you have to participate in, not passive ones where someone or something is feeding you your entertainment. Baking! Who doesn’t like a holiday treat? If you want to go extra old-school, don’t use a mixer! Bake cakes, cookies, and other holiday specialties. Do it with your closest friends or try to find a workshop where you can bake with strangers! The possibilities are endless. If you’re looking for suggestions as to what to bake, check out our post on christmas baking! Read a book Put your Kindle away. Read a tangible and real book that was printed on paper. The book should be heavy enough to at least work as an effective paperweight on a windy day. Tons of great books are published every day so go out and buy one! And I’m sure someone gave you one for your birthday that’s been lying on your night table neglected and unread. Brew some of your favorite tea, sit in a comfortable chair by the window, and enjoy. Write a letter Everyone loves a handwritten letter because it’s so rare these days. Use those handwriting skills that you slaved so hard to learn during your youth and write someone a letter. Spend an afternoon enjoying the process of writing slow where you think through what you want to write before writing it. There’s no need to rush unless you’re trying to get to the post office before it closes. Mindfulness It’s not about the past or the future. It’s about the here and now. Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment through meditation or other activities. It has been shown to reduce depression and anxiety so what are you waiting for? Take 10 minutes for yourself; breathe in, and breathe out. Make a present How about making a present instead of buying one? There are a lot of simple arts and crafts ideas that I guarantee someone will appreciate more than a gift card. To make it sustainable, see if you can’t reuse some of the things that are lying around your home or office. Make a dreamcatcher or a paper star! If you want to unplug this holiday season, then really unplug. Embrace many of the things you used to do when you were a kid. Don’t just look back on simpler times. Make your time simple. Happy holidays!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cables-600x400.jpg","December 15, 2017","en",0.99737948179245,0.0431434214115143,0.571700036525726,0.00607251096516848,0.379084050655365

Before we dive into the new year, we’d like to take a few minutes to look back and reflect on a few of the major milestones achieved over the last twelve months and raise a glass to everyone who participated in and supported our common mission of catalyzing change through social entrepreneurship. Here are five reasons we’re raising our glass to 2017. 1) We grew our community and found new ways to collaborate This year we reached over 500 members at Impact Hub Vienna, growing our community by bringing people with different backgrounds, skills, and resources into our network to collaborate. Our community team worked hard to bring together members to meet each other and share their entrepreneurial journey during weekly member lunches and our melange um vier sugar breaks. Through WineDown events like the Future of Cities, Future of Society, and Food Talks, we invited the larger ecosystem into our doors to not only meet our ventures, but to engage in meaningful conversations and contribute ideas around how we tackle important global challenges like mobility, food waste, food production, social inclusion, and more. We had over 2,000 people take part in these community events over the course of the year. 2) We built a new space to support later-stage entrepreneurs As the social impact ecosystem has matured, so too have our ventures. To support growing startup teams, Impact Hub opened 400 square meters of space on our new third floor. Nine teams moved in this November and have already made it their home. 3) Our program support reached new heights and area codes We also grew the capacity of our programs significantly in 2017, accelerating over 100 ventures last year between Accelerate, the Investment Ready Program, EOI, ADA, Re:Wien, Vielfalter, WWF, Found!, and Innovate4Nature. This year, we also continued to share our knowledge of impact support by scaling several of our programs outside of Austria. Our Investment Ready Program (IRP) is now active in Munich and is on track to launch in four additional cities worldwide in 2018. Social Impact Award (SIA) has scaled into 18 countries since opening in 2009, with 8 locations opened in 2017 alone. After incubating 172 promising ventures from across their locations this year, SIA hosted all 55 award-winning teams at the SIA Summit in Belgrade this October. Together, SIA and IRP hosted Western Balkan Impact Day as part of the Belgrade Venture Forum 2017– the largest investment event in the region. 4) We hosted our most successful CEE Impact Day event to date The sixth edition of our CEE Impact Day had over 200 participants this year, bringing together investors from all over the region to meet our Investment Ready Program Ventures. Key stakeholders met to explore the growing investment and collaboration opportunities and enrich toe social impact ecosystem. 5) We celebrated alongside our members Our members and Impact Hub alumni celebrated many champagne-cork moments themselves this year. Whether it was winning competitions or investment capital, adding new employees or products, or figuring out new ways to serve their beneficiaries, our members reached many of their own milestones in 2017. Here are just a few we’d like to mention: WGE, Schoolfox, Vello Bikes, WADI by Helioz, Hut & Stiel, and Refugees Code were all chosen to participate in ORF 1’s live broadcast of Austria Can! and WADI was selected as the winning project. Hut & Stil won the Green Stadt 2016 Competition and 15,000 Euro. Katharina Moser, founder of MOSAIK, and Martin Wesian, founder of HELIOZ, were featured at the closing session of the political symposium of European Forum Alpbach. Katharina Norden, the founder of Three Coins, and Vesela Tanaskovic the founder of Afforest4Future were selected as one of the 100 global changemakers of Singularity University in Silicon Valley. Perrine Schober, founder of Shades Tours was selected to speak at TEDxTUWien and share her thought leadership on how to turn weaknesses into strengths. Congrats to all our members and the many accomplishments you worked to achieve this year! A big thanks to our members and community As we close out the year, we’d like to give a big thank you to all our members and supporters. Without your help, none of the milestones we reached this year would have been possible. We look forward to working together to achieve even more impact in 2018.

Making Healthy Habits"," Do you find yourself in that same new year’s resolution cycle every year? Things feel fresh, you’ve made your resolutions, and you’re excited for the new year! But, a few weeks or a few months later, you still haven’t filled out your business canvas, begun your search for a co-founder, or even started to floss. Time to change your thinking and make healthy habits instead or resolutions. Demotivation sets in, you get down on yourself, and your resolutions seem like pipe dreams that are further away than ever before. With a new year comes new habits, new goals, and especially new challenges. Making decisions is an important first step, but executing them is the biggest hurdle you’ll face. In order to make this new year a successful one, you need to approach change in the right way. Here are some strategies that we think are the most effective. Photo Credit: Aneta PawlikBe SMART You’ve probably seen or used this system before in a work-related setting but how about adapting it for your own life? SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Organize your new habits with this framework and if your goal is particularly large and requires multiple steps, break them down into smaller ones. Specific: Your goal should be clear and specific. Do not be ambiguous. Answer the five W’s of Who, What, Where, When, and Why to further clarify and define your resolution. Who is involved? What are you doing? Where are you going to achieve this? When are you going to do it? Why are you doing this? Measurable: You need to be able to measure and track your progress towards your goals. If your changes involve number targets, use them. If your goals are more qualitative, define what evidence or behaviour you need to see to know that you’ve achieved your desired outcome. Achievable: It has to be realistic. Ambition is great but overly ambitious changes to your habits can be your downfall. Whatever your goal is, make sure that it’s achievable because you’re only going to set yourself up for disappointment if it’s not. Ask yourself how you can accomplish your goal? If you can’t answer that question then your resolution is probably unrealistic. Relevant: This is the Why question that you answered earlier. Why is this goal relevant to you? Does it align with other relevant goals in your life? If not, then this change may not be the best one to tackle right now. Time-bound: This is the when of the five W’s. Your new habit is specific, measurable, achievable, and relevant. Now make it a product of time. Set up specific milestones and deadlines with specific dates to get you towards your goal. Make a plan Strategize. Attack these changes as if it’s something to conquer. The SMART system is just one way of making a plan. There are other planning methods that might suit you better. If you want to make good on developing new habits, make a plan. Photo Credit: Aneta PawlikTell someone about it Whether this is the first step or the last step, make sure at some point that you tell at least one person about your goals. The more people you tell, the better. It makes what you want to achieve more real when you tell somebody about it. If you can, recruit the people you tell into a support system. Build a team around you to help you when you fall down. Your goals are yours but nobody said you had to do them alone. Be kind to yourself We’re not always the ideal version of ourselves as much as we try to be and that’s okay. Nobody likes to fail, however, failure is how you learn. You learn about what went wrong, how it went wrong, and what you can do better next time. Re-frame your setbacks and failures as learning opportunities. These events don’t define you, but how you react to them will. So, cut yourself some slack, dust yourself off, and keep at it. Just do it! And celebrate! You’ve made your plan and you’ve told anyone under the sun who was willing to lend an ear. Now’s the time to execute. You’ve already thought about what you need to do so don’t overthink it. Just go out there and do it. When you’re one step closer to your goal, celebrate! It’s important to recognize your achievements so make a point of doing so. What are you waiting for? The new year’s already started.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blog-Image-Guide-healthy-habits-600x400.jpg","January 11, 2018","en",0.996219217777252,0.143230736255646,0.302124679088593,0.0563139356672764,0.49833071231842
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/01/17/spotlight-dont-grow-older-grow-wisr-follow-interview-wisr/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: Don’t grow older, grow WisR!"," Only seven months ago, we spoke with Klaudia Bachinger about her dreams for her fledgling startup WisR. Since then, the company has added two Co-founders (Carina Roth, Chief Financial Officer, and Martin Melcher, Chief Technical Officer) and everything is now in full flight. Employees were hired, awards were won, partnerships were built, and grants were given because Klaudia, Carina, and Martin believed in WisR’s mission: to connect skilled and motivated Silver Agers (people in early retirement age or before) with jobs thus helping build the bridge between generations. With everything that’s happened in such a short time, it’s clear that many others believe as well. Klaudia, Carina, and Martin sat down to talk about how they decided to work together, their plans for the upcoming year, and how the challenges keep coming. What’s changed since we last spoke? Klaudia: A lot! The last time we spoke I was alone. As positive as I sounded in that interview, not long after, I was ready to quit because it was getting really hard. I felt like I was not making any progress. I needed a team and had the hardest time finding people who wanted the same things. I gave myself two months to find someone. Luckily I met Carina and Martin and now there’s an office, a company, and most importantly, a team. Carina and Martin, what made you decide to join WisR as Co-Founders? Carina: Martin and I pretty much joined at the same time but I met Klaudia through Lemmings! I asked her what she was doing and she gave me her one-liner and it stayed with me. It was her enthusiasm for WisR and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it so I texted her the next day, asked her to go for coffee, and the rest is history. Martin: Klaudia and I met at Smart Ninja where I was a trainer. At one point, she told me about WisR and it just so happened that around that time I was looking for a change. During the last five years, I’ve worked purely on tech-focused projects and I thought a social project would be something good. It’s something I haven’t done before and what appealed to me was that it’s not just about building a great product–it’s also about building the bigger and greater idea behind it as well. How is the working dynamic between you three? What characteristics do you think make you work well together? Klaudia: What we did at the beginning was have everyone fill out a Co-Founder questionnaire to figure out what everyone wants and what values are important to them. As it turns out, we’re all pretty similar in those aspects. Carina: Our competencies, what interests us, and our roles are fairly separate so we naturally don’t step on each other’s toes. All our abilities and interests complement each other. I’m the numbers girl dealing with finances, Klaudia is the creative and leadership force, Martin is the tech and research genius. The balance is just there. How do you deal with disagreements? Martin: It’s only recently that we’ve had any kind of disagreements but we’ve managed to sort those out. Now that we’re bigger with more people and bigger tasks ahead of us, it becomes clear that sometimes we’re not all on the same page and that leads to some minor disagreements. Before, when we were smaller and it was just the three of us, disagreements didn’t exist. Klaudia: It was actually kind of fun when we all realized that we were having our first disagreement. We all felt it as in it was clear that something didn’t feel right and we asked ourselves what just happened, why did we disagree, so the next morning we sat down, talked about it, and worked it out. Carina: Open communication and direct communication is something we have in our values. We have to stay humble and keep in mind that we have common goals. WisR is always bigger than our egos. Klaudia: We actually do have a hashtag that says: less ego, more talent! #LessEgoMoreTalent Have there been any unexpected challenges so far? Klaudia: Coordinating everyone and keeping everyone informed is a challenge. Martin: We also had to let a couple of people go early on which is difficult when you’re just starting. Klaudia: That was really tough. We liked both these people very much on a personal basis but it just wasn’t the right fit for the team. Telling someone that they are not the right person for the position or for your team was probably one of the toughest challenges so far. What are some of the milestones or successes that you’ve achieved in the past seven months? Carina: We received a €100,000 public grant! And we moved into our first real office on the still new third floor of the Hub! Klaudia: We created the GmbH. We are now finally an established company; a founded company. And we launched our new website and got our first paying customer! Martin: On the technical side, I managed to build and implement a software stack that I’ve always wanted to build and it consists of the best tools that I’m aware of. I’m really proud that I put this together and that’s it’s working! How has the Hub helped you in achieving these milestones? Klaudia: I think I said it before but I’ll say it again. If the Hub wasn’t here, WisR wouldn’t exist. It’s the network, the great people that are part of the Hub, the support, and the positive spirit that keeps pushing us forward. The RE: WIEN program was also a big help. Carina: Yes, we met great mentors through the program and some are still our advisers! It’s also a great vibe here and we love the space. Do you have an example of a memorable mentor moment? Klaudia: There have been a few. Before I met Carina and Martin, like I said before, I was ready to give up. But before quitting I spoke with a mentor and that helped a lot. He asked me great questions and got me to see what I had achieved. I was quite down and was expressing all my worries and fears and it helped me realize that I shouldn’t give up because I wanted to give it one more go and also that it’s okay to be and feel vulnerable. Another moment one was when I had to fire someone. How do you fire someone you actually like? So with another mentor we role played and went through all the possible reactions and scenarios. It helped me realize that it was my fault for bringing on this person so it definitely changed how I saw the whole situation. And it helped answer questions like: What do you say if they’re angry? What do you say if they cry? I still have to lead this tough conversation no matter what happens. You can’t learn this stuff in school. It’s something you can only learn from someone who’s been through it. Klaudia, looking back at the past seven months, could you imagine that you are where you are now? Klaudia: No, absolutely not, It wasn’t until we had the Christmas party and all of the team and our supporters were there where it really dawned on me how big this has become. Like I said before, I was on the verge of giving up so to go from there to here is huge. I try to visualize where we are going to be but the past seven months have gone way beyond my expectations and I couldn’t be more grateful! What are your goals for the upcoming year? Carina: We have very clear milestones. From a product standpoint, there’s the finalization of the platform, the creation of the web app, and the development of the matching algorithm. Sales or revenue-wise, we’ve just started our Pioneer Partner program where we approach corporations to get them onboard to help us grow even if we can’t offer them a finalized product. And of course, further funding! Klaudia: Testing the business model, finding the right product market fit, and showing how what we’re doing is sustainable. Martin: Growing the tech team is very important to me and also being able to pay people what they deserve to be paid. What advice can you give fellow Hubbers who are just starting their own ventures? Carina: Get a team. Klaudia: Get a team that compliments you and that you’re aligned with vision-wise. No man or woman is an island and remember that it’s incredibly hard, you will doubt yourself, but if you believe in it, keep going.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WisR-Banner-600x400.jpg","January 17, 2018","en",0.995175957679749,0.000142065102409106,0.485062755644321,0.00116083280590829,0.513634353876114
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/01/30/book-round-up-the-future-is-now/","ImpactHub","Book Round Up: The Future is Now","I found myself re-reading George Orwell’s 1984. The avid reader’s curse is to find solace within dusty volumes pulled from precarious piles. Reading 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and Handmaid’s Tale provide little comfort amidst the modern life’s turmoil. My usual future oriented book round up was making me depressed. The future is now, the rapid change in technology constantly reminds me. Maybe I need to look elsewhere for my future worlds fix in January. While Orwell wrote books and essays covering everything from the banal to the satirical, he remains one of the best futurists we have ever seen. While he is best known for 1984 and Animal Farm, his minor essays, Notes on Nationalism and You and the Atomic Bomb, strike a chord with new modern audiences. Orwell’s worlds are not ones in which I wish to live. I have no desire to see languages devolve into Newspeak or where “four legs are good, but two are better”. My assumption is most people in the Hub community feel the same. Why else would we be working towards a better future? The blog team thought about it for a while and we put together a list of books offering positive and thought-provoking futures while attempting to solve today’s dilemmas. We threw in a comic book at the end. The weekend is coming and something fun to read is a great way to while away the hours on a cold and grey winter day. Anything by Carlo Ratti Carlo Ratti is one of the greatest futurists in our time. We know listing an author is a dodge, however, his three books reimagine the way we will approach everything from transportation infrastructure to sewers. Check out an interview he gave while at an MIT conference in Vienna. In 100 Years: Leading Economists Predict the Future The world’s leading economists weigh in on the debate, including Nobel Laureates. This book covers everything from the crisis/recovery cycle and persistent inequality. Several scenarios are gloomy; however, many are positive. The book synopsis states, “economists may be better equipped to predict the future than science fiction writers”. Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 Remember all the things in Star Trek we wanted? Tri-corders, visual calls, sliding doors, holo-decks. We are getting there and it is taking time. Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku takes his readers through the current technologies on the market, what is ahead, and what this means for future technologies. Kaku considers real issues we confront now, who will have jobs and what nations will be wealthy? He argues for scientific principles to create safe regulations surrounding how far and fast we go. The Extreme Future: The Top Trends That Will Reshape the World in the Next 20 Years Dr. James Canton has advised three presidents, worked for Apple, and founded FutureLab. He is a high-profile futurist and author. In this book he presents his “guide to navigating the twenty-first century”. He covers topics from medicine to the environment. It can sometimes be a bit gloomy, for example, the predicted world-wide power struggle due to China’s economic rise. Other aspects are markedly positive, take for instance, how new medical technologies will enhance our daily lives. The Future We Want: Radical Ideas for a New Century The editors of this collection call it a manifesto. The book proposes radical changes and dares to think in new directions, for example, “what would business look like without Wall Street”. The ten contributors propose “utopian and possible” solutions to the quagmires in which we currently find ourselves. Expansive and pointed, the book simultaneously tries to answer “what if” in concrete ways. Fun Fiction for the Weekend: Tom Strong We are only including this because it is cool. The creator of V for Vendetta and The Watchmen, Alan Moore, leaves the gritty future he creates within those pages to imagine something new and positive. While the story starts in the 1920s it imagines bold parallel universes and all the good science can do for humanity. And what good is a science super hero without a maniacal supervillain? Enter his arch nemesis Paul Saveen, whose science-oriented plots are as convoluted as you might think.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-round-up--600x400.jpg","January 30, 2018","en",0.985602259635925,0.215195551514626,0.163240909576416,0.288100391626358,0.333463191986084
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/01/edtech/","ImpactHub","EdTech: Bringing Education Closer to the Digital Era"," Education is an institution that has remained largely unchanged for decades. Technology is here to change that. But what is EdTech? EdTech stands for Education Technology. It’s the use of technology to improve how we consume, access, facilitate, and disseminate education. Many agree that the current education system and approaches to education have their shortcomings. Now, due to mass saturation and low-cost of technology, entrepreneurs are leveraging the potential of technology to innovate new approaches to learning. Whether it’s the gamification of learning through virtual reality techniques, hosting entire degree programs online, or facilitating better parent-teacher communication through online platforms, EdTech has already made some impressive strides toward bringing education closer to the digital era. Here are a few examples of EdTech to shed some light on the tech revolution: Massive open online courses A notable example of EdTech that you might’ve heard of or even participated in are massive open online courses offered by services such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy. This is when anyone from anywhere can take an online course. There’s no geographic or physical limitations. You can take these courses from anywhere in the world and an unlimited number of students can participate. It has been revolutionary in its ability to bring education to places and people that have limited access and opportunity. Learning management systems We all rightfully focus on the quality of the education to be delivered but what about all the work that goes into delivering education? That’s where a learning management system comes in. If you’re a student, you’re likely already using a form of this. An open-source example is Moodle which is widely used here in Austria. These systems help teachers to track progress, deliver assignments, and manage students. This makes the administrative aspect of a teacher’s life easier allowing them to focus on the most important part of education: teaching. Collaborative learning Also known as social learning, this is the use of technological solutions to facilitate peer-to-peer learning among students. It is based on the fundamental idea that the best way to learn is to teach what you know to others. Collaborative learning can take the form of wikis, blogs, videos or podcasts with the ultimate goal being the creation of a community whose organizational focus is learning. In this context, a teacher would act more as a facilitator. What’s next? As you can see, there are many applications that exist under the umbrella of EdTech. New technological solutions are being worked on every day and with each iteration, they will only get better and better. It is the new frontier in the field of education and while the solutions hold great promise, we should keep in mind that technology will not solve every problem. These solutions might not be the preferred way of learning for all students. Sometimes, being face-to-face with a person who is focused on you and giving you their attention is what a student needs. This has value and this kind of experience can never be replaced by technology.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/06/frontlines-edtech-alfred-hofer-vision-education/","ImpactHub","EdTech Frontlines: Alfred Hofer, Vision Education"," Alfred Hofer is the Head of Business Development at Vision Education, a developer of language learning and vocabulary training applications for mobile and the web. Their current projects include: LearnMatch, a sports-themed and sponsor-financed language learning mobile App, and phase6 Berufe, a business oriented language training app. Given his passion for EdTech and its importance in Vision Education’s mission, Alfred stopped by to talk about the promise of EdTech, its capabilities, and how we’re just scratching the surface of its potential. How would you define EdTech? As it relates to Vision Education, I would say it’s taking the didactic knowledge that we already had that existed in books, the analog systems, and bringing it to the digital realm by adding additional digital benefits and state-of-the-art possibilities. For us, it’s leveraging the popularity of the smartphone, using the existing hardware, putting educational software on it, and enhancing it with more in-depth information. What are the benefits of EdTech for the learner? Since a person has their smartphone with them wherever they go, if it’s loaded with the educational software, it gives the learner more flexibility and enriched content. If you’re waiting for a train or waiting in line, you can take your phone out and do your vocabulary training. EdTech can also facilitate new ways of learning and training. One that I find interesting can be best explained with an example. Let’s say you’re learning English and you’re preparing a presentation and you find a new word. You can mark that specific word on your computer or phone and it will be automatically added to your vocabulary training lesson on your learning app. That allows the learner to fluidly build their own personalized lesson plan. This isn’t possible without a digital solution and the seamless integration of PC and mobile. What are the elements that are required in order to make an application successful? I can’t speak for other EdTech companies who have different focuses but for us, what’s important for LearnMatch is to bring joy and fun into the learning experience and we’ve done this by adding gamification elements. For example, since our target group for English with LearnMatch is A1 and A2 learners, they would be mainly between the ages of 9 and 15. So they can compete against each other in real-time in a LiveMatch and there’s rankings, badges, team competitions, and monthly tournaments with prizes donated from our sponsors. While we are specifically targeting this age group with the gamification elements, we’ve also found that this appeals to adults as well who are learning Spanish or Portuguese and playing LiveMatches with their family and friends. How important is it to work with teachers and educators? It’s always important to work with experts. Which expert depends on the audience that you’re trying to reach. If it’s schools, then yes, it is absolutely vital to work with teachers. You need to cooperate with teachers, educators, and the textbook publishing houses because they not only own the content but have 20 or 25 years of expertise on the content and the didactics in school. If the audience is corporate, executive, or management, you need to consider working with training and certification providers so that you can leverage their expertise as well. But of course, those different target groups need different arguments and deal structures to get involved. What do you think are some of the challenges that EdTech faces? Most companies in the EdTech space are startups so they don’t have the financial power and abilities of the old-fashioned traditional education suppliers. If you want to expand globally, there are limitations. Speed becomes a factor where people might want your product but you can’t expand fast enough to deliver it. The legacy players are also trying to digitize their offerings. They have a lot of money but have had varying levels of success. So either you find your niche market and compete alongside them or you cooperate with them by starting strategic partnerships where both sides benefit. What are some challenges that Vision Education has faced? Has there been any resistance to your app from teachers? There’s been no resistance so far fortunately. We’ve gotten great positive feedback especially from teachers who praise the fun elements of LearnMatch. Some are amazed to see kids actually learning on their own! And we really value any constructive feedback from teachers, parents, and users worldwide because they are on the ground level interacting with the app. Their feedback can only make what we offer better. How do you see the future of EdTech? What impact do you think it will have? Flexibility in learning and an increased trend in “small portions”. It’s always on and available. Companies will have lower organizational costs for training sessions. It’s going to be a co-existence with the analog solutions but I see EdTech solutions taking a big piece of market share in the long run like we’ve seen in the music, film, and publishing industries. And it will be the innovative startups that will be the ones disrupting the whole sector. What are some of the potentials of the technology you think are worth exploring? When it comes to language learning, audio and speech recognition will become more and more important. Right now, our interface is touch-oriented but since a lot of language learning is speaking, designing audio interfaces shows a lot of promise. Augmented and virtual reality are also interesting avenues. Since they are immersive, they can be a great benefit to learners for subjects that require a more immersive experience. Think about learning about the galaxies, stars, and constellations. Putting on VR goggles and actually navigating the cosmos sounds far more effective than learning it from the page. What impact would you like to see Vision Education have? We hope to expand our global reach through our partnerships with NGOs such as Pro Mujer, who support women and children in Latin and South America. We’re currently trying to set up a similar program with a NGO in India. Our goal is to support language learning initiatives around the world because we believe there’s a social responsibility that comes with having the technology. These partnerships are very rewarding and are possible because the distribution of education through technological solutions costs far less than traditional books. Overall, since we’re a language learning company, we want people to understand each other better and communicate more effectively with one another. Like our partners all around the globe, we believe that education and language learning is an important investment in the future of each individual. If I’m interested in EdTech, how do I get involved? Just reach out to the companies. Everyone has their own specializations so find the one that you’re interested and say hello!

Skip all presents and invest all the time into your family and friends, going for relaxing walks and cooking a delicious meal. Cooking could become a whole-day experience, starting with a brunch and cocktails in the afternoon, ending with a zero-waste holiday or birthday feast. For birthdays, you can think about ways to spend time with the special person, make a memory as opposed to giving them something else to store. If you really want to give a gift, perhaps you can consider a new option. There are many makers in Vienna who work exclusively in upcycled goods, you can find them at events like Edelstoffe and Feschmarkt. Certainly, you can also make presents for your loved ones – hand knitted scarves, embroidered handkerchiefs, or hand sewn pyjama pants are always welcome gifts. If you are looking for great ideas come and check out LUNZERS Maß-Greißlerei as they also offer a huge variety of zero waste cosmetics and household-equipment, especially if you don’t have time to make something by hand. Family and Friend Holidays: Sometimes we focus too much on the material trappings around any holiday; presents, eggs, chocolates, costumes, etc. It amounts to a large volume of stuff that no one wants or needs. Maybe spending time doing things with your family and friends Is a better way forward. Go see a movie together, take a nature walk and enjoy the changes from winter to spring. As the weather warms, go for a picnic, and admire Vienna’s gardens. These are all waste free options and create stronger bonds between loved ones. lunzers greißlerei 14.3.2014 (c) julia fuchs Holidays for others: If you feel like giving back, look out for community events or cooking-session in homeless shelters. Find a way for you and your loved ones to volunteer together. Create a memorable experience and give back at the same time.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/08/ed-tech-sector-challenges-2018/","ImpactHub","Ed Tech Sector Challenges 2018","Ed Tech is a highly visible sector in the entrepreneurial and start-up markets. In August 2017, The Guardian reported the industry would be worth €146 Billion by the year 2020. Despite the sunny financial outlook, every sector faces challenges. Ed Tech Magazine reported in 2015 the top five challenges faced by the education technology sector were budget limits, inadequate professional training, resistance to change, inadequate infrastructure, and unreliable hardware and software. In 2017, eLearning Industry, a website dedicated to promotion of the industry sector, reported the top four challenges being resistance to change, cost limitation, the disconnect between educational theory and action-based platforms, and the volume of offerings within the sector. 2018 Sector Challenges Earlier this January, SI News reported the largest challenges facing the education sector, not only the technology portion, will be the changing job market, increasing the focus on social and emotional intelligence, and educational technology. Ed Tech promises to revolutionise the education – everything from “homework assignments and marking to giving students with special needs the support they require”, according to SI News. However, educators are asking for new and innovative offerings, according to an article published by Forbes Magazine earlier this month. The blog WizIQ reports the top challenges within the technology segment of the sector as lack of universal accessibility, absence of uniform content, lack of professional training, low in classroom adoption rates, cost limitations, and high volume of competing product offerings. Not much has changed within the traditional education market segment. Sector Fragmentation WizIQ reports one of the largest disruptive trends to hit the sector in 2018 will be mobile learning. “A Flurry Data report suggests a 69% increase in in-app time in 2016. This metamorphosis in the EdTech industry led to an increased reliance on mobile-learning, empowering students to adapt to advanced educational technology cutting across socio-economic and geographical boundaries” In mid-2017, The Guardian had identified this trend, stating “while many startups focus on schools, others recognise that education in the 21st century doesn’t just rely on the classroom”. There is a whole segment of self-learning within the digital market place. “It’s not just teachers looking for new, fun products to aid with developing 21st-century skills, but parents too as they look to supplement their child’s education out of school,” says Filippo Yacob, CEO of Primo Toys, the company behind award-winning toy Cubetto told The Guardian, in the same article. “The things that we need to learn today aren’t necessarily learned at school. Education is often based on a very traditional system which doesn’t always accommodate new ways of learning and new ways of thinking,” Yacob continued. “The world of learning and play are becoming closer together and are becoming more integrated,” says CEO Bethany Koby to The Guardian in 2017. Home Grown Talent Alfred Hofer of Vision Education chatted with us earlier this month about their offerings for every language learner. The LearnMatch app, developed by Vision Education, offers high quality language training. Last year was a big year for Vision Education. They launched their initial LearnMatch app and partnered with some of the largest companies in Austria to provide access to language learning opportunities. For 2018, they hope the app will “have a greater international reach”. From a local market segment perspective the hope is LearnMatch will be adopted “across Austrian classrooms as its unique gamification-elements and its LiveMatch feature gives kids and young people a motivational boost for vocabulary-training”. The experience will be a new one for parents and teachers looking for innovative language learning offerings, Hofer continues. Echoing Koby above, Hofer says “learning almost happens automatically when embedded in a playful and emotional context like football – all that is LearnMatch”.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/13/marketing-for-startups/","ImpactHub","Ten Commandments of Marketing for Startups","Your startup took off like a rocket: you have your website, your social media, your grand vision. Now you want to attract customers and investors so you start thinking about marketing. Here’s the issue: you have no idea where to begin; your business is too small to afford a marketing specialist and in general you are not sure what marketing really is. I put together this list of ten commandments for a healthy marketing strategy for startups to get onto the right path! #1 Start with marketing in mind I am a marketing consultant so of course, I will tell you that marketing should be your main focus right next to your product. Why? Because a good marketing strategy is defined by and rooted in the vision of your business. Because to quote Simon Sinek, “people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” Ideally, you develop your marketing strategy alongside your vision, product concept and positioning but many entrepreneurs I spoke to only think about marketing when it comes to the selling phase. Deep breath, not all is lost if you find yourself in the same spot too! Pull everything you did for your business plan and start your marketing strategy from there. Your brand idea will dictate your copy. Your target audience will determine what channels you need to use. Your business end goal will polish the short and long-term goals of your marketing efforts. #2 Complete your documentation I say, ‘brand guidelines, marketing strategy document, marketing personas, SEO worksheet, website content plan….’ You say, ‘Um, bitte?’. Be that person and create a complete and detailed documentation of your marketing strategy. Have one document, where your wholesome marketing plan can be looked at and improved, polished, and referred to. The internet is full of free templates you can get your hands on. Once you create these documents you will see that putting your marketing strategy into words helps you keep track of your campaigns, allocate your resources and start seeing the big picture. #3 Become a full-stack marketer If you open your own business, you have to go in with the mindset of a can-do person. Come to terms with the fact that you will have to learn a lot of things on your own to help your startup thrive. Take time to enrol in marketing courses on Udemy or Skillshare, attend workshops and training. You can also check out free resources, such as: Google Analytics Academy The Begginers Guide to SEO by Moz Google Online Marketing Challenge HubSpot Inbound Marketing Course #4 Set up a feedback system Your startup’s testing phase is when you can hammer out your marketing strategy. Make sure you create a solid feedback system for your product, such as asking customers for testimonials, sending them a post-purchase evaluation form or a regular survey. Monitor your Google Analytics to check the strength of your online offering, run focus groups to hear opinions about your advertising campaign before it launches. Make sure you check your social media analytics regularly to determine what content makes your audience tick. #5 Be smart about your resources Real talk: you have limited resources in terms of manpower and finances. You rely on goodwill, free content and try to spend your money in a smart way. It’s part of being in the startup business. So why are you not allocating your time and physical resources in a more efficient way? I recently did a series of free marketing consultations at the Impact Hub Vienna. Every single person I spoke to had a complex marketing plan but actually lacked time and expertise to action it. Time and time again I speak to solopreneurs, who just launched and landed 5 social media profiles, weekly blogs, a newsletter and oh, they also do a podcast. Focus on less but be consistent. Be realistic about what you can do and don’t beat yourself up about not delivering the amount of content you think you should. Automate where you can and templatise like there was no tomorrow. #6 Own your channels In the era of pay to play and constant algorithm changes, it’s impossible to succeed on social media and collect large following the same way startups did just 2 years ago. This is why it is so important to invest more time into the channels you own such as your website and your newsletter list. Tomorrow Facebook might decide that Business Pages are invisible unless they pay but nobody can touch your newsletter list. #7 Invest into your customers When somebody buys from you, they are your kings and queens. Your customer is more important than a potential customer. Make sure you appreciate that relationship and invest into amplifying its meaning. Make sure to comment on the social media post they wrote about you and reshare it. Get their testimonial. Thank them in a social media message. Send them a follow-up email with a special offer. Remember their birthday. Such small things will earn you true customer loyalty. #8 Learn the basics of good copywriting Content is important but how do you get people to visit your page or click on the sign-up button? You flirt with them through a good copy. Your feedback loops, contact with your customers, social media analytics, website traffic data will give you a good indication what copy does it for your target audience. Don’t wait to brush up on this valuable skill though! You should definitely check out CopyHackers to learn how to test and polish your writing to start converting viewers into participants. #9 Don’t be afraid to re-evaluate The beauty of testing your startup concept is the fact that you get to re-evaluate and improve. However, don’t assume that the testing phase ever ends. Your marketing strategy is subject to literally everything; from the variable economic situation, changing buying tendencies, social media algorithm updates, to new data policy. Keep improving but don’t be afraid to re-evaluate when you have to and accept it as part of the process. #10 Dare to be different There is the invisible benchmark or marketing for startups than have every new venture set up a Facebook page, reach to local newspapers, host an event, participate in online giveaways and a number of other online must-dos. Many people give in and burn out by the time they get the opportunity to snatch a significant market share. Grow at your own pace with your own rules. You don’t have to have a robust content marketing plan or work on your Instagram when you don’t really believe these tools will serve your vision. Do things differently. Think about your resources, your skills and your passion. In the end of a day, your marketing strategy relies on your consistency and creativity. Protect these assets by avoiding things getting too dull.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-round-up--600x400.jpg","February 13, 2018","en",0.996769726276398,0.106138890056172,0.678598314523697,0.0178739175898954,0.197388868778944
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/16/winners-vielfalter-accelerator/","ImpactHub","Winners of the Vielfalter Accelerator Program"," Vielfalter is a startup accelerator program supported by Impact Hub Vienna, Kalkalpen National Park, WKO of Steyr, the regional development agency of Upper Austria, the Scheuch Family Foundation, and the Leader Region Traunviertler Alpenvorland. Vielfalter was looking for innovative entrepreneurial ideas in the fields of ecological agriculture, sustainable tourism, food, health, and wood, that will have a positive effect on the Kalkalpen National Park region while creatively using its diverse resources. Every contestant attended an acceleration program which, depending on their needs, educated them on topics such as impact modeling, business modeling, financial planning, and sales and marketing. Due to the guidance and support provided by the accelerator, contestants developed their businesses quickly putting many of them in a prime position to win prizes. Here are the 4 winners of Vielfalter who were recently announced at an event in Steyr, Austria. Obstraupe Receiver of the €8,000 first prize, the Obstraupe is a harvester developed by David Brunmayr and his team at Verein Paradizer. It’s designed to harvest orchards efficiently and cost-effectively without damaging the fruits. Fruit orchards are vital ecosystems that contain over 5,000 different species of plants and animals. However, over the last 60 years, 85-90% of fruit trees have disappeared and the trend shows no sign of stopping. The Obstraupe is designed to push back and reverse this trend by offering farms and individuals a low-cost tool to harvest their fruit trees, keeping orchards, and the ecosystem around them, viable and thriving. Kalkalpen.Wild Winner of the €6,000 second prize, Kalkalpen.Wild offers a local and sustainable alternative to lovers of wild game. The Kalkalpen National Park area is home to a large variety of wild game untouched by the effects of modern farming or animal husbandry. Due to the structure of the local agriculture, animals rarely come into contact with things like pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers. Kalkalpen.Wild is looking to build up their premium brand, offering a local solution to wild game that uses lead-free ammunition while building awareness concerning the dangers that lead-usage poses to biodiversity. Spreissl Spreissl and its inventor Katharina Salcher-Aigner is the winner of the €4,000 third prize. Spreissl is a regionally produced, sustainable and carbon-neutral firewood. It is made from domestic, PEFC-certified and air-dried wood from the Kalkalpen National Park region and packed in recyclable wooden crates, jute bags, or cardboard boxes. Normally, firewood is packed in plastic and imported from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and other countries further east. Verein Bergwiesen Last but not least is the winner of the €8,000 special prize, Verein Bergwiesen. Their mission is to support the conservation of the biodiversity in the Kalkalpen National Park region by revitalizing and protecting the meadows of the mountains. Since they started two years ago, Bergwiesen has revitalized 25 hectares of slopes and meadows allowing for the regeneration and increased biodiversity of plants. Their long-term plan is to sell high-quality hay and pellet-food for horses and rodents from the revitalized areas.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-16-at-2.15.03-PM-1-600x400.png","February 16, 2018","en",0.965999603271484,0.00013091106666252,0.969571650028229,7.87763055996038e-05,0.0302185881882906
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/27/social-media-a-fuel-for-education/","ImpactHub","Social Media:  A Fuel for Education","One of my first essays at high school was about negative aspects of Facebook. I lamented about it destroying our relationships. Back then I understood it as a platform for wasting time and pointed out its overall meaningless. It never crossed my mind that a few years later I will participate in a Facebook group class for one of the college courses I took. Let alone, that it will become one of the essential tools for interaction and learning; a fuel for education. It was heavily snowing in Zagreb and public transport was blocked. During the evening I received a message on a Facebook chat from my professor. Accompanied with a link the message said: “Since it’s not possible to have a class tomorrow, join Facebook event I created for our session. We will discuss research on International Journalism. Click attend so I can mark your presence.” Not only was it considerate, but in a way creative. In 2011, not everyone was so keen on Facebook, especially in Croatia. Using it as a substitute for a class and a new learning method was definitely a breakthrough. But it didn’t stop there. Later on, the flourishing of various sorts of helpful social media tools for learning made them inevitable in one student’s life. Educational Platforms Take for example learning management systems, such as Moodle or Schoology. Their multifunctional characteristics enhance studying and actually make it possible. These networking software’s serve as administrative platforms for delivering educational programs Social media functions are integrated in the systems of LMS. Activities such as chats, videos or forums benefit students and improve their efforts. This way they have better reach and effect, especially when they include live conferences, webinars etc. Nowadays, education is more than just attending courses. We might as well learn from our networks, friends and stumbling upon news, so-called informal or incidental learning. Invariably it stems from our social media accounts. They have gained credibility as a source of information dispersed from institutions and organizations as well as users and audiences. What makes it even more appealing is the interaction, participation and engagement it ensures. Research Methods Besides learning, social media are effective when conducting data collection for a research. Tinder as a methodological tool? Yeah, right. Hold on, it is right. Even more than right. For sociologists it is almost an unavoidable platform to connect with people from troublesome locations. Imagine a scenario where you are alone in a war affected foreign country, not speaking the language and doing ethnographical research. It comes in handy, doesn’t it? Not only for meeting up, but for actual learning about the people, culture and the country. Monitoring what the users are doing on social media channels is also growing. This helps with observational data in research processes. Platforms as CrowdFlower enable this method. Last, but not Least…Networking I couldn’t wrap my mind around latest news about research without Twitter. It is my number one tool for following advances in research fields of my interest. I connect with experts, professors and research teams, who regularly post about their published pieces or attended conferences. In terms of education, it might not be that helpful, but the goal of networking adds up to entire social media usage.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/03/08/international-womens-day-women-and-entrepreneurial-success/","ImpactHub","International Women’s Day: Women and Entrepreneurial Success","The narrative is the same globally. There are fewer women entrepreneurs than men. However, women are more successful than men while self-employed or starting businesses. In honour of International Women’s Day, we thought we would pass along the research findings and help the whole community achieve greater success. A statement in the above paragraph requires qualification. Fortune magazine reports, “Companies helmed by women entrepreneurs had 13% higher revenues than those run by men, and finished 9% above the average for all entrepreneurs surveyed”. Fortune magazine went further and even broke the statistics down for women by generation, “Millennial women also reported even higher revenues than their already-above-average gender group for the coming year: for women, revenues were 9% above the overall average, and for women ‘millennipreneurs,’ it was 22%”. The Big Question This really does beg the question, why. What are the secrets to women and entrepreneurial success? There has been a lot of research performed on this topic. Virgin reported on a 2015 study by the University of Cambridge and Barclays and distills this reason from the available research, “where male entrepreneurs are likely to take risks to grow their business quickly and then find an exit route, women tend to aim for controlled growth and avoid gambling”. Forbes magazine lists five reasons why women are more successful than their male counterparts with respect to entrepreneurial pursuits. Their list, derived from the Center of Entrepreneurship’s 2015 report, includes: “Women are better calculated risk takers, women are less prone to over confidence, women are more ambitious, women are more likely to take a long-term view, and women succeed despite facing more barriers than their male counterparts”. Business Barriers The Forbes article reports women succeed in the face of multiple barriers. Earlier this year they stated women generally start businesses with significantly less capital than men. On average women’s starting capital is around $75,000 USD compared to men at $135,000 USD. Forbes also reports women do not think they have the networks in place to support their business growth. Women entrepreneurs and small business owners make up 30-35% on the entrepreneurial community globally. While there are dedicated networks for women small business owners, founders, and investors the fact of the matter is the community is very small and spread out over vast areas. In the same article, Forbes reports women think they lack the technical expertise to successfully run and grow their businesses. In large part this is related to the gender imbalance in the STEM fields and in the traditional business sectors, like finance and accounting. These perceived lacks force women to work harder for success. How do we push past these barriers? It is in the list above. Taking calculated risks, not being over-confident, and being very ambitious. Additionally, women have long term goals and strategies in mind. Forbes reports, “the research suggests women are more likely to reinvest business profit in order to generate steady and profitable growth, while men are more likely to look for faster growth, possibly fuelled by equity investment, and a quicker exit”. Positive Impact These personality traits paired steady, long-term growth strategies means “female entrepreneurs in the Centre for Entrepreneurship study take home twice as much pay as the men,” according to Forbes. Our advice, there are several successful women in the Impact Hub Vienna community. Here is a quick list we published last year. Spend International Women’s day asking a successful woman for business advice. Or read a book from this helpful list we published written by and about successful women business owners.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cover-winedown-closing-the-gender-gap-600x400.jpg","March 8, 2018","en",0.992027819156647,0.0208408366888762,0.727264761924744,0.151809856295586,0.100084505975246

Someone who can financially back your company and mentor you? Pitching to investors maybe the key to your success. Having a well prepared, organized, and short pitch deck is important to attract investors. An investor’s time is valuable which means five minutes or less is an ideal pitch length. The main goal is to let them know what your business is about, why it is important, the target market, and why they should invest. However, just the numbers can disengage an investor. You have to engage them and tell them stories. Intrigue them. Make them love your company and your idea. Five minutes doesn’t seem like it would be enough time to do everything. It doesn’t even seem like enough time to get the basics out. We assure you it is possible. The key is to be precise, concise and go straight to the point. They don´t need to know everything. There really is only one thing an investor needs to know, why they should invest in you and your idea. We put together some basics to help you create a pitch to investors Introduce yourself and your business Let them know what your business is about. What is your industry? If they are already familiar with it, then make it quick and provide necessary information only. Word choice is important. Be concise and clear. Sometimes, simpler words are better to express your idea. E.G. Use the word “use” instead of “utilize”. They actually mean different things and “utilize” does not make you sound better informed. Tell them an exciting story about your startup, everyone loves to hear stories! Inspire them! E.G. Tell them your origin story. Stories are exciting and inspiring. How did you become Bill Gates to the organic food movement? Tell them who you are and why you are in this business. At the beginning, you will not have data that applies specifically to your business or product. You haven’t started yet. You will have general market data, possibly statistics on comparable products. Investors understand, “At this point, they’re investing in you and your team,” explains Sheeva Sairafi, the founder and CEO of “Local and Lejos” said in an interview with Ivanka Trump’s blog. Show them that you and your team have the necessary skills, experience and passion to execute your startup. “Angel investors invest first in the entrepreneur not in the business plan. It’s important that the investor and entrepreneur can get along. They will want to see that you are fast, thoughtful and efficient, and can sustain the project through its conception and growth” says Baybars Altuntas in an interview with Forbes magazine, a successful entrepreneur and Ambassador of the World Entrepreneurship Forum, a global think tank dedicated to entrepreneurship. Know your product/service This is one of the most important points. At the end of the day, you want investors to provide you financial support because your idea is good. Let them know what problem your target customers are facing and how your business will solve it. They need to know why you offer a better solution than those already on the market. Give them a balanced account; let them know the pros and cons. Prove why your idea deserves funding. In order to do this well, you need to know your market well. This means knowing your customers and competitors. It might be a good idea to put together a “buyer persona”. This is a communications and marketing tool to help you better communicate with your target audience. By creating one for your pitch deck it can help you deepen your market knowledge. Make a business canvas There are many good reasons to create a business canvas. It keeps you on track and it helps set goals. In this context, it shows investors you are capable. Some key points to include in your pitch: Check out how to create a nice Canvas Model https://canvanizer.com. Creating visually appealing and informative documents show that you are prepared and informed. Give your prospective investor a copy at the end of the meeting. They can read the details later and have a reference for decision-making. Escape Clause Investors need to know what will happen if your venture doesn’t work out. Or what will happen if your venture is wildly successful. The first one is obvious, they want to protect their investment. However, the second businesses have failed before with rapid expansion and no way to handle unexpected growth. Be Prepared Think about questions may arise and have answers prepared. Practice A LOT. Not just the answers to questions but your entire presentation. Practice until you feel natural delivering it in your sleep. Remember that first impressions are powerful, prepare yourself for show-time! When Christine Chang and Sarah Lee pitched their Korean beauty company, “Glow Recipe”, on Shark Tank, they found that the key to success was practice. “We were confident that we knew the ins and outs of our business better than anyone, but it came down to succinct and compelling delivery,” says Christine in an interview with Ivanka Trump’s blog.

Alpengummi Alpengummi makes the first chewing gum that consists only of renewable raw materials, all of which are produced in the Austrian Alpine region. The chewing gum is made from tree resin and beeswax which supports two traditional domestic trades: the almost extinct art of resin extraction, and beekeeping. In addition, the chewing gum is refined with tooth-friendly birch sugar and local essential oils. markta markta is a digital farmer’s market that connects regional food producers with regional consumers. Their goal is to create sustainable solutions for food supply. All their products can be purchased online directly from producers. Customers receive additional insights to the high-quality regional products they buy which promotes awareness of the true diversity of food. Pflanzen-Urinal The “Plant-Urinal” is a urinal for men and women with an integrated vertical plant-based treatment system. Treated and purified wastewater can then be reused in the toilet. This project is being developed by alchemia-nova GmbH in collaboration with Blue Carex Phytotechnologies. In addition to wastewater treatment, the vertical plant wall offers all the advantages of a green wall such as microclimate improvement, reduction of air particulates and pollution, and a nature-based aesthetic. The goal of the project is to develop a functional nature-based solution for city dwellers while increasing the biodiversity in heavily developed areas. SEEDPAP – Die blühende Verpackung The idea of SEEDPAP is to produce packaging that blooms. Packaging is made of waste paper filled with insect-friendly seeds. It is suitable for gifts, paper bags, egg cartons, and for filling packages. When the packaging has served its purpose, it can be covered with a little soil and if kept moist, it will sprout! SEEDPAP’s goal is to raise awareness of the importance of insect pollination in food production. Their packaging can be used not only in large gardens, but also in flower pots, small front gardens, and fallow areas.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nature-600x400.jpg","March 20, 2018","en",0.988118052482605,0.000216981221456081,0.866624414920807,0.00011352345609339,0.133045092225075
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/03/27/women-at-work-five-books-for-leading-ladies/","ImpactHub","Women at Work: Five Books for Leading Ladies","At Impact Hub Vienna we are celebrating the women leaders and founders in our community this month. We wanted to feature some inspiring books written by women to keep inspiring all the female founders and everyone else in our community. This year we focused on the question of leadership. C-suites and corporate boards still have few women. We cannot solve the problem in one day, however, we can inspire our community to act by reading these books. We put together this list of the best books for leading ladies and female founders. We have listed five books we know everyone should read to create more inclusive workforces and confident women leaders. We know you can’t focus on work over the holidays which is why we included some fantastic fiction reads for passive inspiration. Leading the Way Through the Labyrinth: The Truth About How Women Become Leaders Authors Eagli and Carli explore the myriad of issues affecting women becoming leaders today. The main concept of the book is the glass ceiling is no longer a proper metaphor for women attaining leadership roles. They admit women have made real progress in this arena, however, there is still a long way to go. All the way through the labyrinth. The maze created by prejudice, organizational behaviour, traditional gender roles, and everything else under the sun. While this book focuses on women in leadership roles, it does highlight the stark exclusion of men from every day family life. Grounded in vast research with personal stories to illustrate the overall argument, the book is an academic tour de force. A Good Time to be a Girl Helena Morrissey is at the forefront of the campaign for gender balance in the UK. Morrissey makes the case for diversity in the workforce and a more inclusive society as the only way to move forward. Achieving gender balance in the workforce, is for Morrissey, a driver of economic success of societies and individuals. While the book and author do court some controversial views, the message is clear, we need everyone to move forward. The Confidence Effect: Every Woman’s Guide to the Attitude the Attracts Success Grace Killelea astutely asks “women are told to step up and lean in, but how?” For Killelea it is not just about a patriarchal work culture. “Men are prone to overestimate their abilities, while women too often sell themselves short,” and Killilea questions women’s overall confidence in striking out and achieving their goals. In this essential guide book, she lays down simple strategies for women to bolster their confidence and increase their influence by practicing “the Four Rs of Success-relationships, reputation, results, and resilience-dipping.” This book is essential inspiration for anyone. Earning It: Hard-Won Lessons from Trailblazing Women at the Top of the Business World Finance is a man’s world and reporting on financial matters is the same. Joann S. Lublin was among the first women reporters at the Wall Street Journal. She rose through the ranks to lead a bureau office in London. She chronicles her success, along with fifty other successful women at the top of their game. Lublin is an experienced journalist peppering the lessons in success these great ladies learned along the way with concrete strategies and personal anecdotes. Lublin focuses on the specific dilemmas women experience in the work world. However, she never forgets women have other identities outside of their working lives, meaning lover, sister, friend, mother are all meaningful roles and deserve time and effort. A Better Tomorrow We Should All be Feminists Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes everything; fiction, non-fiction, short stories, and some philosophy. Really, anything by her is amazing and worth reading repeatedly. What else would you expect from someone who won the MacArthur Genius Grant. The book is short and simple. Its message very clear: we must all change to be equal. If you don’t have time to read the book, Adichie gave a powerful TedTalk to summarize the book. Passive Inspiration The Power Naomi Alderman won the Bailey’s Prize for Women’s Fiction last year for this novella. The world is recognizable, it is our own for the most part. Well, there is one tiny twist. Teenage girls suddenly discover they have the power to cause indescribable physical pain, even death. This is speculative fiction at its best, forcing readers to see our current world through new perspectives. Moon Girl and the Devil Dinosaur Who is Marvel’s smartest superhero? Tony Stark is likely what you answered, however, you are wrong. It is Lunella Lafayette, she is nine years old, sports a backpack, and her side kick is a giant red dinosaur. The comic tackles gender issues, social inclusivity, and race issues all through the eyes of a child. The art is beautiful and the stories are action packed. They are also perfect for any clever girls in your life which you wish to see grow up into confident women. Need more inspiration?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/01/spotlight-interview-xxx-reji/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: An interview with Alexey Chernikov about Reji, a language learning app."," Reji is a subscription based iPhone/iPad app that helps you learn new vocabulary with correct pronunciation using customizable flashcards. It is the third app from Twopeople Software, a nascent startup specializing in language learning. Alexey sat down with us to talk about what’s special about Reji, why he and his team decided to develop it, and what they have planned for the coming year. How did it all start? What made you decide to develop Reji? Reji started as a result of one of our other apps called Mate Translate, a translation app. It has this feature called Phrasebook where you can create custom word lists. Reji is a spin-off of this with additional features added for language learning. We decided to do this because from a marketing perspective, it’s difficult to position a product that’s a translator and a language learning application at the same time. Putting them in two separate apps is simpler and easier for everyone. What makes Reji stand out from other language learning or flashcard apps? What’s the value proposition? Concerning language learning apps, I don’t think there’s anything like Reji on the market. Most other language learning apps like Duolingo or Memrise are focused on teaching you basic grammar and vocabulary with no ability to customize anything. The app has a lesson plan for you and you do it. We are targeting advanced language learners whose skill level has grown beyond these apps. Their main need is to brush up on or expand their vocabulary. If we’re talking about flashcard apps, there are other apps on the market like Anki, but it’s incredibly time-intensive to make your own flashcards–you basically have to fill everything out by yourself. With Reji, all you need to do is type the word that you want to learn and the app will do the rest. It’ll populate the images, GIFs, phonetics, transliterations, and definitions associated with the word giving the user more time to learn. With other apps, it can take almost a day to make 100 flashcards. With Reji, it’ll take around 10 minutes. Why is what you’re offering important for today? I think with globalization and migration, it’s very important that we learn each other’s languages. I want to offer people the ability to do that in the best and most effective way. I also think that technologies that can help you learn something or improve yourself are important and if I can provide this solution, you’ll be better and as a result, the world will be better. What made you focus your efforts on language learning? I’ve always had an interest in languages. I’ve been learning English since a very young age. I’ve also learned German over the years and started to learn some Czech and French. It’s my area of expertise given my personal and professional interests. I’m all about languages. What milestones would you like to hit in the next year? One important milestone is to hit 10,000 paying users by the end of this year. Another one is to offer the App on Android. These two markets are different and we’ve focused on Apple because that’s the market we know but we’re well aware of the opportunity with Android. Our current iOS market is around 60,000,000 people. If you add Android to that, it becomes 700,000,000 because of developing countries like India, Vietnam, and Brazil. Have their been any setbacks or challenges to launching Reji? We are self-funding everything ourselves so we’re always dealing with a lack of resources. The reason why we’re launching only on iOS is because we lack the resources to launch on iOS and Android at the same time. This also affects our marketing spend which would typically be Facebook ads and other things like that. But these constraints force us to get creative with our marketing efforts so we’re focusing more on growth hacking solutions to spread our message. How many people are on your team? There’s 4 of us right now. 3 full-time and one-part time. We’re all working remotely but the hope is that after the launch of Reji, we can get the money to have everyone in the same place. While working remotely has worked and does work, it’ll be nice to not have any time lag or slack lag in conversations. How hard is it to program an app like Reji? How long did it take to develop the app? Nowadays, I think with online courses, you can get the basics of App development without having to be a mathematician, a scientist, or a technician. Reji wasn’t that hard to code because we’re not using anything complicated like A.I. or deep learning. It’s mostly a user interface with some interaction with servers. It’s not easy but it takes time. To get the test version up and running, it took us about two months but I should mention that we were working off the code base that we had for Mate Translate. I would say, if you started Reji from scratch, it would take a full-time developer about 5 months. It’s a lot of work. What impact would you like to see Reji have? I really want people to be able to learn words more effectively and to be inspired to learn more languages at the same time. If Reji can achieve that then I’m happy. What’s next for you and your team? We want to figure out what’s the best business model for Reji. Right now, we’re working off of the assumption that a subscription business model will work. Over the next few months, we’re going to test that theory and find out what works best for us. We’re also looking into some startup accelerators. I feel that we lack some experience in growing products globally. We already handle 500,000 monthly users. We want to be able to handle 50,000,000. Reji is now available in the Apple App Store.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/09/the-fierce-female-founders-of-impact-hub-vienna/","ImpactHub","The Fierce Female Founders of Impact Hub Vienna","In March, we focused on Social Development Goal #5, Gender Equality, and discussed how female entrepreneurs are making significant strides toward balancing out the number of businesses founded by women versus men in Austria and across the globe. While there is still a long way to go, our recent WineDown on Closing the Gender Gap inspired us by convening en masse a group of active and aspiring female entrepreneurs to learn from founders who are currently starting and scaling their own businesses. To keep the sharing and connection going, we wanted to capture insights from a few more women entrepreneurs in our community to share their unique perspectives as founders and business owners. We asked each of these ladies why it’s important for women to startup and what insights they have to share about entrepreneurship. Here is what they had to say: Lisa-Maria Sommer, More Than One Perspective “The majority of founders are still male. I think, it is important women also start founding their own businesses and realize their brilliant ideas. In this way, young companies will be shaped by women and profit from their vision, working styles and energy.” MORE THAN ONE PERSPECTIVE, a social business based in Vienna working on the labor market integration of highly skilled refugees. She founded MTOP with Julian Richter and Nina Poxleitner who she met while working at Teach for Austria where they came face to face the consequences of a poorly conceived integration program. Cornelia Mayer, Topfreisen “Founding your own business gives you freedom – you don’t need to ask anyone to make a decision and you can shape the relationship with your co-workers and customers the way you want. Everyone has to do what is in his or her power to shape the world in a fruitful way – founding your own business is a beautiful way to do that.” Cornelia Mayer is the founder of Topfreisen, a catering service with refugees cooking food from their home countries. After traveling for six months, Cornelia was seeking new challenges in her career and wanted to take on new projects outside her role as a social worker. With the founding of her catering business, which also recently launched a bistro, she found the perfect extension for her professional background and new learning experiences. Perrine Schober, Shades Tours “It is important for everyone to strive to do what they really want – if they have the luxury of being able to choose. I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone to have a business, as it is hard work, re-shifts all priorities you have in life. To have an additional role – the one of a business owner – is an addition to all different roles that you have in life, such as: mother, daughter, friend, lover, sister, aunt. However, once the hard work is done, once the business is growing and standing on its own feet, once it is viable even without you, then gratitude sets in. The gratitude to have been able to have invented the most suitable job for yourself. How many people can say that?!” Perrine Schober is the founder of SHADES TOURS in Vienna. She studied tourism management in Germany and specialised in the topic “Tourism As Macroeconomic Tool for Poverty Alleviation”. Schober worked for several international development aid agencies in Vietnam, Eastern Turkey, Belize and the Philippines until she decided to start her own social business in April 2015. SHADES TOURS offers socio-political tours on the topic of poverty and homelessness in Vienna, given by homeless people with experience in the Austrian social systems. Andrea Lunzer, Lunzers Maß-Greißlerei “Running your own business is the most self-empowering thing a woman can do. To make your vision come true and decide what, where, and with whom you want to work with is very rewarding. It is important to set an example for younger women so they can grow up in a world where female leaders are common. Andrea Lunzer is the founder of Lunzers Maß-Greißlerei in Vienna. The zero-waste store is the culmination of her long standing struggle to reduce packaging waste. Several stops in the packaging and food industry led Andrea to create a radical alternative to normal grocery shopping and go zero. Since opening its doors, Lunzers has become much more than just a grocery store it’s the place to discuss zero waste lifestyle, locally sourced food, and DIY cosmetics–to name a few things–and is expanding its activities in hosting a passionate zero-waste community. Karin Kuranda & Jessica Neumann, Endlos Fesch “We believe that women are great leaders and of course they bring so much expertise on many different levels. Unfortunately, women are underrepresented and undermined in many areas, specifically as CEOs. Therefore, it is important to encourage more women to steer companies and create their own businesses, where they can act independently and highlight their strengths.” Karin Kuranda (right) and Jessica Neumann (left) are the founders of Endlos Fesch – the Vienna Fashion Library. Members can rent high-quality women’s fashion, including pieces from local designers, e.g. MaMaMu, Tutu Vienna, and die Rote Zora. The library currently offers about three hundred pieces. The options are a mix of fair fashion, sustainably produced clothing, ex-favorite pieces from community members, and vintage dresses. As part of the zero waste Austria initiative, Karin and Jessica believe in social and ecological change for a greater impact. The founders actively apply existing sustainable and green solutions that focus on using zero waste technologies.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/10/tech-for-good-the-basics/","ImpactHub","Tech For Good: The Basics","In the nineties, the pervasive attitude towards playing videogames was like the way in which people viewed television. They would rot children’s brains. They would make children act out violent fantasies. My sister’s orthopedic surgeon suggested to my parents playing videogames might help my sister develop hand eye coordination skills and dexterity. We received a Super Nintendo the following Christmas. Recently, research has suggested immersive story telling games, like the upcoming Detroit: Become Human, help players develop skills in reading emotions and empathy, like reading fiction. While videogames still have a bad reputation, it would seem they are doing some good in the world by helping children with cognitive and physical disabilities gain necessary skills and helping the world be just a bit more empathetic. The technology cannot be all bad, right? However, can technology be good? Many people support the idea of Tech For Good, including the biggest technology companies but what does it actually mean. Ethics and Technology Technology, in and of itself, is neutral. It is neither “good” or “bad” by any philosophical definition. However, it is how we choose to use technology which confers the moral status. The above paragraph is incredibly philosophical. However, the concept requires definition and sometimes it is best to start off at the highest level and work backwards to a workable and practicable definition, with examples. The British website Tech for Good has the best and most grounded definition, “At its heart, it’s all about people. People using the power of tech in myriad ways, both simple and extraordinary.” They provide some high-level examples as their definition continues, “to help redistribute power, give agency to people, help people make more informed decisions, create ways for people to connect, participate, address health or care needs and save energy.” This broad definition begs the question of what this looks like. In the real world … The future is now, at least in the case of super markets. Carlo Ratti Associati have worked with Coop, in Italy, to develop the super market of the future. Reflective screens give shoppers information on the origin and methods used to grow their produce, including “the details of its journey to the market,” the Business Insider reported in a January 2017 article. Carlo Ratti Associati hope the market will promote more informed consumption habits. The shelves in the market are lower, intentionally. “The idea is that, since customers can see into the next aisle, they might strike up a conversation with a stranger,” the Business Insider reports. The design firm is hoping people will develop new social links in this manner. aWATTar is a Vienna based agency which provides consumers with information about when the highest levels of renewable energy are in the power grid. They are hoping through providing consumers with accurate information we can shift the demand and create a greater dependence on renewable energy sources. Fitness trackers are on the rise. They help us all make healthier choices in our day to day lives about walking and calorie consumption. They are good for us and the environment by decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels and increasing our dependence on our own two feet. The Fitbit and Apple Watch can provide accurate, long term information about heart rates to physicians. There are reports all over the media about how the stored historical data allowed physicians to make a more informed treatment decision, identifying life threatening irregular patterns, and even using the technology in arrhythmia studies. It also gives patients greater agency in their own care by providing them with useful and timely information. It is amazing what a little information can do to improve our daily lives and our future.

However, before you can deliver ground breaking technologies which provide tracking on world poverty eradication, design new braille technologies and fonts, or tackle the human machine design interface you need inspiration and to get the basics right. With those thoughts in mind we turned our bookshelves to find the best books for tech entrepreneurs. As per usual, we threw in a couple of fiction books and a comic book for weekend reading. We hope these will inspire you to innovate and create something new. On the Shelves Conscious Capitalism This book by John Mackey, Co-founder Whole Foods Market, and Raj Sisodia present the argument that capitalism can be good. Not just good but is inherently good. The authors argue capitalism can work for management, stakeholders, employees, and society at large. While the opinion is certainly controversial, they profile many successful companies across an array of fields to illustrate their argument. They present an instruction manual for any company looking to evolve ethically. Start Up Land: How Three Guys Risked Everything to Turn an Idea into a Global Business Written by Mikkel Svane, the founder the CEO of Zendesk, the book chronicles the founding of the business and the friendships which survived the whole ordeal. This book is part memoir and part guide. Svane is speaking to other entrepreneurs from the perspective of someone still running the business, still making difficult daily decisions, and still working on the original exciting idea. This book is useful for anyone looking to scale up or even thinking of jumping into the deep end. The Second Machine Age: Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explore our love affair with continual invention and innovation of technology. And while they celebrate our progress chronicling the development of self-driving cars and Watson the Robot, they also explore the question on everyone’s minds: what happens when the machine takes over my job. The authors provide a blueprint for prosperity in the face of adversity, making radical recommendations like changing the education system. Optimistic and well-researched the book is essential to anyone looking to successfully navigate in the coming machine age. Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley This book is filled with insights from former Twitter Advisor and Facebook Product Manager, Antonio Garcia Martinez. The eponymous chaos monkeys he refers to in the book at Uber, Tinder, Netflix, and many other disruptive tech companies which changed how we live our lives. And while he does chronicle the rise of these disruptors, he also has a few tales about his own adventures being a “Silicon Velley wastrel,” which is a term not often used any longer. The book is a subversive and irreverent look inside the tech bubble. Sometimes going forward means looking back Sometimes the best way to move forward and harness the power of technology is to realize we do not need it. And so, we have a recommendation for a book on the opposite of technological progress and innovation. The Revenge of Analog Written by Canadian journalist David Sax this book is a loving portrait of how we are resurrecting what used to be. Sometimes the latest and greatest thing is something already invented and the hot new thing on the market has always existed. From a vinyl pressing company to notebooks, from successful paper-based magazines to crowd-funded bookstores, he explores worlds we had thought long gone but were merely hibernating. The book hit the best seller lists world-wide, and even features the Viennese photography movement, Lomography, which is taking the world by storm. Metropole reviewed the book last year, check out the full article. Because no one wants to work on a summer weekend Don’t worry, we have you covered. It is beautiful outside. The weather is warm. The sun is shining. Pack yourself a picnic and a blanket and head to the park for a Saturday afternoon. While away the hours soaking up all the lovely sunshine by reading some fiction. The Martian Andy Weir transports us to the red surface of Mars and the tragedy that befalls the main character, Mark Watney, when he is abandonned during a raging storm on the planet’s surface. He uses the technology available to survive. Everything from hydroponically growing plants to eat to eventually communicating with Earth. The book is packed with realistic technology and is an exciting read. Mr. Terrific Self-made millionaire and owner of a tech company Mr. Terrific is truly a super hero for the entrepreneur.

This month, we’re celebrating those who lean towards the latter. We want to shine a light on the people you walk past every day who are using technology in a positive way to change how we think, how we care, and how we read. Here is the lineup of teams that will join us at this month’s WineDown. World Data Lab The World Data Lab is a predictive and analytical NGO specializing in developing granular economic and demographic forecasts for every country at any point in time. Their products harness the power of social, econometric, and geospatial data modeling to help decision-makers in the public, private and international development sectors. Their most popular product, the World Poverty Clock, is a webtool that forecasts poverty rates in every country of the world from today through 2030. The goal is to monitor the progress of UN SDG Goal #1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere in real-time. Humanizing Technologies Humanizing Technologies are experts in robotics. They advise, sell, and develop applications for robots. You’ve probably seen them around the city with their robot Pepper. They offer retailers the possibility to seamlessly create, manage, and deploy content to multiple robots with one click–you can welcome, assist, provide recommendations, entertain your customers, and even give hugs to people. Humanizing Technologies’ main goal is to bring humans and technology together. One of their current projects is to explore how Pepper can help in caregiving for people suffering from dementia. Tetragon Tetragon is the inventor of the Braillering. It is a refreshable and mobile braille display for the visually impaired. Braille displays have been around since the 70’s but little has changed since. They are often large, limited in capability, and prohibitively expensive. If they are small, they are even more limited in capability, and even more prohibitively expensive. The Braillering will change all that. Costing little more than a smartphone, blind people will finally have the mobile braille reading solution they’ve been dreaming of. Impact Go Impact Go is going to be the next generation of giving. Their goal is to provide mothers and children in Africa with medical services. Donors will know exactly where their money is going and how they’ve created impact. Impact Go is the first Austrian start-up which cooperates with African start-ups. refugees{code} refugees{code} is an Austrian not-for-profit coding school for refugees whose goal is to integrate refugees into the job market. Participants develop coding and software development skills through an intensive 9-month training program that finishes with a job placement. Vienna Data Science Group The Vienna Data Science Group (VDSG) is a nonprofit association promoting knowledge about data science. Their goal is to establish a platform for knowledge exchange between data professionals from research and industry, data enthusiasts, and other interested parties enabling giving everyone the ability to seize opportunities and understand the risks lying ahead. Don’t be afraid of tech. Embrace it like these ventures. Make the choice to use it for good. If you do, the possibilities are endless.

Since the beginning of cinema, movies have shown us depictions of technology. From the classic Metropolis, to Sleeper, to Blade Runner, the technology depicted inspires as much fear as it does awe. Here’s our list of 5 Tech For Good movies we think are worth watching: Minority Report One of the highlights of Spielberg’s career, Minority Report follows Tom Cruise as he gets into all sorts of trouble in the PreCrime Division of Washington, D.C. of 2054. If you’re not engrossed by the neo-noir storyline and the philosophical issues, there are autonomous cars, insect robots, multi-touch interfaces, and retina scanners to keep you entertained. This all might seem a bit dated since all this technology exists now (except the insect robots), but remember this was 2002. Marvel at how much they got right. And keep an eye out for the crown jewel of all technological achievements: jetpacks. Short Circuit Sometimes, dangerous military technology just needs to be struck by lightning. This is the plot of Short Circuit, an 80’s classic with none other than Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, and Number 5! The robot becomes sentient, learns about the world, and tries to prevent his deactivation by his creators. With the topic of killer robots occupying the headlines of today, take some time to watch a movie where you will see how non-killer robots are just way more fun. 2001: A Space Odyssey If you haven’t seen it already, you’re just in time for the 50th anniversary of this Stanley Kubrick’s classic. A pinnacle of sci-fi cinema and easily the most influential and referenced, it not only set the bar of what film could achieve at that time, but it also showed us what technology has brought us, what it means to us, and most importantly, its limitations: “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Her A touching love story from the great Spike Jonze starring a wonderfully forlorn Joaquin Phoenix about what happens when we give life to technology. Theodore Twombly is a lonely and depressed man who enters into a relationship with an OS (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who can adapt and learn. If you want to be reductive, it’s a movie about a relationship with a computer. But, if you give it a chance, it’s so much more than that. We always have this idea that technology is inhuman but if it’s created by us, how could it be anything but human? Jurassic Park A movie that needs no introduction now that we’re almost five movies in. But this is the original and yet another Spielberg classic. Try not to focus on what happens when the dinosaurs break out and start killing people. Focus on the fact that there are dinosaurs again! How cool would that be? It made me believe, and it still does.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/18/spotlight-interview-sara-biazar-cmo-world-data-lab/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: An Interview with Sara Biazar, Head of Client Relations at the World Data Lab"," The World Data Lab (WDL) is a predictive and analytical NGO that uses public sector data to forecast life expectancy and income for every country in the world. Their goal is to make this data accessible and personal and make everyone in the world count. Data’s the new frontier and the demand for WDL’s products is exploding. Their predictive data can help NGOs and Governments better forecast demographic trends to plan more effective projects. Fueled by WDL’s mission and maybe a cup of coffee or two, Sara took the time to sit down and talk about the beginnings of the WDL, the challenges they’ve faced along the way, and how they want to help solve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). How did the WDL come together? The World Data Lab was founded by Wolfgang Fengler, Lead Economist at The World Bank, and Homi Kharas, the Interim Vice-President and Director of Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution. They were former colleagues at The World Bank who wanted to expand beyond the boundaries of large institutions and do something new with data. They wanted to predict and measure data better than its ever been done before. What are the goals of the WDL? One of our missions is to apply data to help measure and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Unfortunately, international development organizations and governments are often a step behind. They have old data, or it’s past-looking data, or the numbers aren’t updated regularly. We want to use forward-looking data to create a new approach and bring problem-solving into the 21st century for the developing world. We also support the private sector in finding new and emerging markets. What is the value proposition of the WDL? Our value proposition is the democratization of data. We want to make sure that everyone has access to the power of Big Data, and to make it meaningful to non-data people who might be overwhelmed by the vastness of data out there. What are some of your current projects? Currently, we are working on merging our income and demographic data to create a new data set that no one’s created before. We want to give organizations the ability to see income distribution by age for every country. For example, how many men or women in Guangzhou, China will make 50 to 75 dollars a day in the year 2025? That is something that doesn’t exist and we’re working really hard to make that happen. We have incorporated this and other data forecasts into our private sector webtool, the Market Pro. This tool allows private sector companies to explore future emerging markets and calculate future market size. We are also working on a project that will provide income and age estimates from space using earth observation (i.e. satellite) imagery. We, along with our Austrian partner GeoVille, got a grant from the European Space Agency to do this project. We combine our econometric and demographic data modeling techniques with earth observation photos to create a more robust data set. We have other geospatial data modeling projects where we use this methodology to provide income and age estimates for North Korea which is a place where nobody has any solid data. What impact would you like to see the WDL have? We would like to empower institutions with cutting edge tools to solve SDG issues. Because we’re smaller and faster, we can develop these tools quickly without the bureaucratic red tape and put them in the hands of those who can make the most out of them. What are the some of the challenges you’ve faced to get to where you are now? We’re a small team that wants to make a big impact and we have an ambitious goal. One challenge was proving ourselves alongside the giant institutions with larger resources such as The Economist but we’ve managed to do that. Sustaining funding, as with any young organization, is also a challenge. Our solution has been to develop products for the private sector which will help us fund our public sector projects and keep us afloat. We do receive public sector grants, but they are often given out piecemeal which sometimes doesn’t align with a rapidly developing organization. What are some of the milestones you want to hit over the next year? We would like to begin development on the World Water Clock (SDG-6), the World Hunger Clock (SDG-2), and the World Education Clock (SDG-4). We are in the early stages of developing partnerships with large international organizations to tackle these projects, so this takes some time. We currently have 4 global hubs responsible for subnational data collection as well as modeling: Kenya, Pakistan, and Indonesia. We’ve just on-boarded Brazil, and later this year we hope to have Mexico, Rwanda, Uganda, and Iran secured. How can members of Impact Hub help? We need some more connections to private sector companies who could use our products. If anyone knows someone who needs income or demographic forecasts, please send them our way! Our products are designed to help marketers find and develop new markets on a very granular level. This is really important because building out our private sector client base will give us more breathing room and more time to do the research we need to do to create the tools that can help the world.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/25/communication-skills-startups/","ImpactHub","Communication Skills for Startups","Communication Skills for Startups Startups have a lot on their plate. Startup to-do lists are burdened with business plans, accounting, paperwork, marketing, tech issues, financial issues, and more, often on a limited budget and with limited staff. It’s hard to know what to prioritize when there’s so much to do. With all this to worry about, one mistake many entrepreneurs make is to leave communication plans by the wayside. Gregor Schütze, founder of Schütze, a positioning and public performance agency in Vienna, visited our first Skillshare breakfast of 2018 to discuss top communication skills for startups. Let’s take a look at some of the ways entrepreneurs should start setting up their communication plans. Define your target audience Before you even start actually communicating, you should define your target audience. Gregor asserts that you should have more than one target audience, and each form of communication should be tailored to that audience. For example, you are going to communicate differently with your investors than your employees, and you’ll even want to focus your message a little differently to your existing customers compared to with your potential customers. When you’re coming up with a message, make sure you decide which audience you’re “speaking with” before you start. Entrepreneurs often forget about communication with their employees, but, according to Gregor, it should also be considered a specific field of communication. It will be valuable in the long-run, and it’s unique from any other kind of communication (and is essential to treat it as such). Decide which media to use The type of media channels you go through is just as important as the message itself. You can write the perfect message for your target audience, but if you’re publishing it in a space that no one in that group reads, it won’t have any effect. You should first decide whether you want to go through classical media (basically anything written by reporters) or new media (social media, online advertising, etc.). While things are certainly moving more towards new media, classical media nonetheless remains relevant for specific audiences. When deciding on media to use, you should not only keep your target audience in mind but also your credibility. Gregor mentioned that research found that local newspapers have the highest credibility, but it still only makes sense to go through local newspapers for specific types of audiences. Form a crisis communication plan (before a crisis occurs) Having a crisis communication plan is more important than you might think. No matter how big or small a company is, lacking a crisis communication plan could be the beginning of the end if the worst happens. Having a crisis and dealing with it well can actually increase the credibility of your brand rather than ruining it, as long as you’re prepared in advance. As outlined by Gregor, there are three aspects to having an effective communication plan: PreparationTake the time to sit down and think about what the worst thing that could possibly happen to your business is. Plan every single aspect of how you would deal with that crisis occurring. Decide who would do what tasks (i.e. who would talk to the media, who would deal with investors, and so on). Ideally, this will never be necessary, but it will help everyone know exactly what they should be doing if the worst does happen to you. SpeedThere is no time to spare during a crisis. You don’t get to take the weekend to think about it, because people will continue reacting during that time. There is no time to sit down and set up a plan; not responding for a while in the time of a crisis makes a company look disorganized at best, immoral at worst. CredibilityWhen discussing the crisis with the press, don’t say things that you think sound good. Say things that are true. Whatever you do, don’t lie about something — it could destroy your company’s credibility. Feel free to keep certain details to yourself, but whatever is said should be the truth. Measure your communication activities Some of these forms of media cost money (and at the very least, they cost time), so knowing how to use your communication efficiently will help you in the long run. As Gregor pointed out, paying 1 Euro for Google Ads is probably better spent than spending 1 Euro for an hour of PR — but then again, it also depends on your message and audience. Every startup is short on funds, so being efficient with your spending is crucial. This is where measuring comes in handy. Whatever communication you can measure, you should. See if you can use a tracking code on any posts you have on other websites to see what the traffic looks like. Get acquainted with Google Analytics (a free resource) to start tracking conversion rates. You can even track the results of communicating via classical media. If you want to try out a few new newspapers, publish in them one at a time. That way, you can better pinpoint which one actually led to the best results. In the end, it’s all about saving you time and money while achieving success.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/03/may-migration-inclusion/","ImpactHub","Understanding Migration and Inclusion","Many of us remember the busy train stations of Vienna when thousands of refugees were arriving or passing through in 2015. It was a chaotic scene, but dozens of volunteers and several organizations stepped up to help them pass through or arrive, giving them supplies and providing them show that these migrants were welcome here. Many trains pulling into the station were greeted with applause. But of course, the journey of migration doesn’t stop upon arrival. It’s been nearly three years since that initial “refugee crisis” of 2015, and press, as well as public interest, have seemed to fizzle out in recent years. What hasn’t fizzled out, however, is the predicament that recent arrivals have found themselves in. How does one start a new life in a brand new, unfamiliar country? Getting acclimated to their new city and country is a huge piece of the puzzle, and often it’s a very difficult one. Sometimes it takes years to really find your place in a foreign environment, whether you’re a Western expat or a refugee from a war-torn country. This doesn’t even take into account the difficulty that language, skin color, and religion present in a society that can sometimes be hostile towards these differences. Luckily, people are aware of this, and initiatives have been started to help jump-start the lives of many arrivals. Some are designed to help refugees find a place to stay. Others are designed to help with educational aspects of their lives. Once their basic needs are met, refugees can start to become self-reliant and engaged in Austrian society by joining the labor force. It isn’t easy to get your foot in the door when you’re a new arrival, but it can make a world of difference in the lives of the workers as well as the city and country’s society as a whole. Impact Hub Vienna, in cooperation with Deloitte Future Fund Austria, has taken steps to recognize some of those ventures that are helping refugees access the labor market via the found! accelerator program. Whether it’s mentoring programs, job creation, or breaking down stereotypes, the ventures supported by found! offer a glimmer of hope for the future. And, better yet, this is just what we’re recognizing. There’s even more out there, and more in the works. Let’s take the month of May to focus on migration, the problems migrants are facing in Vienna and elsewhere, and some of our ventures’ solutions to those problems. After all, if refugees succeed, we all succeed.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/04/spotlight-interview-myounghee-jo-alexander-bachinger-bubbles-kraut/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: An interview with Bubbles & Kraut"," Longtime Impact Hub members Myounghee Jo and Alexander Bachinger have just launched Bubbles & Kraut, a social venture addressing the food waste problem through fermentation. They offer workshops and sell their very own fermented products such as kimchi and kombucha and hope to build a community focused on food sustainability and preservation. With their first workshop just around the corner, Jo and Alex sat down to talk about the very beginnings of their venture, the plans they have for the future, and the ongoing mystery of who is Bubbles and who is Kraut. What made you two start Bubbles & Kraut? Alex: We both had certain ideas of what we wanted to do. Jo wanted to do something with food, community building, and cooking workshops. She wanted to bring out the social and communal aspects of cooking. I always wanted to do something with fermentation and sell fermented products, especially kimchi because it’s one of my favorite things in the world. Jo: Since I’m from Korea, kimchi is my soul food and that’s where we connected and found our common ground. After I met Alex, it was clear to both of us that kimchi could form the foundation of workshops and that we could sell it so it was a natural synergy of our passions that allows us to fulfill our independent ambitions together. How did you come up with the name? Were there other names that you considered? Jo: We had a fun brainstorming day and the list got pretty long. There were a lot of funny and nice names but we narrowed it down to two. We were actually leaning more towards something else: it’s a combination of our names and it also means: “I like it,” in Korean. It sounded perfect! We loved the meaning behind it and how it represented us both but through our research it became clear that Bubbles and Kraut had more appeal. Alex: We tested the two names. I’m a huge fan of testing and Bubbles & Kraut won out. There were also practical considerations such as the surprising number of restaurants with the other name. But, once we decided on Bubbles and Kraut, it grew on us very quickly and now we can’t imagine it being anything different! Why are the services and products you’re offering important for today? Alex: Food waste is a big problem these days. In Austria, 760,000 tons of food is wasted every year. Through our workshops and our products, we’d like to raise awareness about the food waste issue and share our skills and solutions. Fermentation allows you to preserve food longer and our hope is that sharing this knowledge will have some measurable impact on food sustainability. Jo: There’s also the community aspect. We want to get like-minded people to interact with each other and share solutions, and enjoy food in the process. What is fermentation? Alex: A quick definition is that fermentation is the process of using the microorganisms that are naturally in the air to change the sugars in food into acid which helps preserve the food. What are some of the health benefits of eating fermented foods? Jo: In Korea, there is a belief that eating fermented foods is anti-aging so we believe that it’s good for your skin, and helps your body age gracefully. Alex: It’s good for your gut flora which helps in having a strong immune and digestive system. You feel less bloated or uncomfortable on a given day. There’s now some theories that the health of your gut flora influences many aspects of your body including your thought process and clarity of mind so it could help with productivity as well. What’s the working dynamic between you two? Who brings what to the table? Jo: My background is in graphic design so my strengths are being used for the visual aspects of our business like website design and branding. Alex: I’m handling more of the communications side of things. I’m also the scientist trying to create interesting new flavors and flavor combinations. I think we’ve settled into our natural roles. So far so good! Jo: We try to be honest and communicate. We’re both creative people so we’re always bouncing new ideas off each other. If there are any disagreements, we both try to focus on the fact that we’re both bringing our best and want what’s best for this venture. What are the values of Bubbles & Kraut? Alex: Sharing and sustainability. We both care deeply about these values. We want to share our knowledge about fermentation and food waste. On a practical level, we are trying to partner up with local farmers and use so-called ‘misfit’ vegetables that cannot be sold in regular markets. We also don’t want to waste our products so we’re going to try a made-to-order model. We will produce as much as our customers demand. We’d like to call this: FAIRmentation! Jo: I’d also say creativity and community. Because we are going to be using seasonal and local produce, we are going to get creative with the kinds of kimchi we will be producing. I know Alex is excited but I’m also excited to explore the new possibilities! And we are both really eager to build a movement and a community around these values. Even though you’ve only just started, have there been any challenges you’ve had to overcome? Jo: I think every day is a challenge for us. Everything is a first for us so we’re always trying to figure out the best way to get things done. I think we’re where we need to be and now it’s a matter of doing the work. Alex: Coordinating workshop venues, customers, and suppliers, even for a venture as small as we are can be logistically complicated. We know we need help and one challenge was reaching out to people and asking for help and realizing that It’s OK not to know things. What impact would you like to see Bubbles & Kraut have? Alex: I hope that we can teach people about preserving food. Fermentation has been used for hundreds of years but people all have fridges now so the art of preserving food through fermentation has gotten a bit lost over the years. We’d like to bring that back and show people what they’re missing. Jo: I’d like to see us having an impact in expanding the variety of food that is typically eaten here and opening up people’s minds to the wonderful diversity of food. What is it about fermented foods like kimchi that gets you so excited? Jo: For me, it’s such a big part of my life and my culture. Kimchi reminds me of home and I think it’s the perfect side dish for everything–not just Korean food, but European food as well. In Korea, we say that it has a cool flavor which is hard to explain in English. It’s kind of like, tasting a bit of the ocean. Alex: There’s a tangy and fizzy quality to kimchi that I just love. It has an incredible combination of flavors that I feel is like a taste explosion. It can be salty, sweet, and sour all at once. There’s also so many different kinds of kimchi. You’re never stuck with one kind so it never gets tiring. How can Impact Hub members help? Jo: We’re very open to everyone becoming our customers! Try our kimchi and join a workshop! Alex: We’re still looking to optimize our production process so if anyone knows of any farmers or shops that might be interested in working with us, please let us know. We’re also looking for maybe a restaurant or a kitchen that would be open to the idea of letting us use their kitchen downtime by allowing us to produce our products. Last question: who is Bubbles and who is Kraut? Jo: Technically, I am Kraut and Alex is Bubbles contrary to everyone’s expectations. But I feel that I’m a bit of both at times. Sometimes more Bubbles and sometimes more Kraut. Sometimes I feel like my head’s in the clouds and sometimes I feel more grounded. Alex: I like that. It’s a balance between the two. I think at the end of the day, we’re all Bubbles and Kraut. You can follow Bubbles & Kraut on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BK_Blog_Post_Cover-600x400.jpg","May 4, 2018","en",0.993877708911896,0.00938384586333996,0.574665457010269,0.00788092496804893,0.408069744706154

While everyone has an opinion on this subject, it’s important to try and see different points of view. The topic is heavy but it’s a reality of our ever-changing world. Looking away doesn’t change anything so for those who want to look closer, here are 5 documentaries about migration and social inclusion that you need to watch. Stranger in Paradise A mixture of fiction and documentary, this film depicts an actor (Valentin Dhaenens) in a classroom at a detention center telling real refugees about what Europeans think of them. It is brutal, powerful cinema and has to be seen to be believed. The Good Postman A wonderful documentary about your average person trying to do what they believe is right. It follows the election for mayor of a tiny and dying Bulgarian village on the Turkish border. Our protagonist is running on a pro-Syrian refugee platform believing it’s the key to saving his dying town but he faces resistance from some of his fellow villagers. It’s beautiful, sad, but true, and shows us that even in the smallest and remotest of places, this topic breeds division. Fire at Sea Pretty much the benchmark as far as documentaries about migration go, this absorbing and acclaimed film shows the lives of the people of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many migrants from Africa and Middle East, alongside the lives of the migrants themselves. The movie switches between the two and takes no position in either, simply showing what it’s like and asking the viewer to form their own opinion. Human Flow Chinese artist and filmmaker Ai Weiwei shines a light on the refugee crises occurring all over the world. Filmed across 23 countries, it’s an ambitious and exhaustive look at the plight of those who are just looking for a safe place to live. God Grew Tired of Us This film follows the journey of three Sudanese men who escaped the conflict of their home country and start new lives in the US. The three men come off as charming and noble as we watch them adjust to their new lives and the new culture that surrounds them. It shows what can happen when we allow people in. Winged Migration For the mathematicians, this is the sixth documentary on this list. On top of that, it’s decidedly not about the migration that we’ve been talking about. But, it’s a migration nonetheless. So if the other movies were a bit heavy, sit back and witness the beauty of the migration of birds and think about how we all deserve to be this free.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/11/spotlight-interview-katha-schinkinger-habibi-hawara/","ImpactHub","An Interview with Katha Schinkinger about Habibi & Hawara","This week I sat down with Katha Schinkinger, director and shareholder of Habibi & Hawara. Habibi & Hawara is a restaurant and catering business in the heart of Vienna that serves Austrian Oriental cuisine. Their mission is to hire staff with refugee and migrant backgrounds to train them with the relevant skills to become successful entrepreneurs of their own. They are 2018 finalists of the found! program. Katha Schinkinger, director and shareholder of Habibi & Hawara. Photo credit: Deloitte, photo by Cochic PhotographyWhat does “Habibi & Hawara” mean? Habibi means “friend” in Arabic and Hawara means “friend” in Viennese slang. Both words are meant to have the same origin, so it’s a handshake in itself. What inspired you to start Habibi & Hawara? The idea came up in summer 2015 when Europe, and especially Austria, were confronted with a huge amount of refugees seeking asylum in Austria. Some friends and I started an initiative called “Hosten Statt Posten,” which means “hosting instead of social media posting.” We invited refugees from nearby camps like Traiskirchen (which were really overwhelmingly full at this time, making a very bad situation for the people living there) to Stadtflucht Bergmühle, which is a club countryside in the north of Vienna where you can eat very well and enjoy yourself in nature. It was meant to happen once or maybe twice, but we got into a little routine and ended up hosting more than 1,300 refugees, from summertime until autumn. Through this we got to know a lot of people. We saw a lot of entrepreneurial potential in the people that were coming at this time. We asked ourselves how long it would take for well-educated people, from Syria or Iraq for example, to open their own businesses. As we know from some studies such as those from OECD or the European Union, the average time it takes for a refugee to just find a job is about 4 to 5 years. That means it would take even longer for them to open their own branches or businesses. So, our idea was to build up a business that serves as an incubator for entrepreneurs. Since food is a common universal language, the logical step was to think of a restaurant. What are some of the challenges you’ve had to overcome to get where you are now? I think all challenges every startup has to face and then special challenges concerning gastronomy. Although it was an easy step to think of a restaurant, it was actually a weird idea because gastronomy is one of the hardest businesses — especially in Austria and Vienna, because we have so many good restaurants. So it’s pretty hard to be successful. My background is in marketing and PR, which is not unimportant in this field. So I think the brand is strong and doing well, but (laughs) it would have helped to have some ideas about gastronomy in the beginning… That meant we had to change a lot only in the first year. After making a few changes, it became more and more successful. We started with around 16 people, and now we have 24. 16 of these people have a refugee or migration background. The restaurant is now 2 years old – pretty young, we’re still in the toddler age, but it’s doing quite well. What do you think are some of the main challenges refugees face when they come to a new country? The biggest barrier is definitely the language, so that’s why we came up with the idea to offer a certificate in language courses. We’ve offered it since January this year. We have a certified language teacher coming in once a week, and our staff can join. They just don’t learn common German but also gastronomy-specific vocabulary which helps them to establish their skills. Another challenge is the image of a refugee in Austria. With the right-wing parties in Austria and other European countries, it’s hard for people seeking asylum facing challenges like this here in Austria, especially after dealing with so much in their home cities already. And of course, resettling and restarting their lives is quite a challenge. What impact would you like to see Habibi & Hawara have? What’s next for Habibi & Hawara? Our goal is to offer as many jobs as we can. We want to not only give jobs, but our staff should also grow and develop together with us. Our vision is to open branches, such as small takeaways. Our employees should become their own CEOs. Although we’ve been talking about restaurants and gastronomy, we are quite open-minded for other kinds of businesses as well. How can members of Impact Hub help you with your mission? Please be our guest and book us for caterings! Telling others about us via word of mouth will help, too.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/22/start-ups-the-european-voluntary-service-program-a-conversation-with-martin-pavelka/","ImpactHub","European Voluntary Service: Martin Pavelka","Let’s start with the basics, what is European Voluntary Service Program (EVS) and how did you decide to embark on this experience? European Voluntary Service is a program which enables young Europeans aged 18 to 30 years to live up to 12 months in another country working in a non-profit or social business organization. It is a program especially designed for those who want to travel, live in a different culture, learn a language and get a priceless international work experience. After finishing my studies, I traveled a bit and after spending a few months in the US, I decided to relocate to a different country for at least some time and EVS seemed like a perfect combination of everything. Why did you decide to do your EVS at Impact Hub Vienna and what were your tasks as a volunteer? I knew about Impact Hub from Bratislava but I was never part of it before. After seeing the opportunity, I was immediately impressed by how vibrant the community seems to be and being part of this platform looked like a great way how to broaden my own horizons. I was part of the Community & Membership team where we would facilitate the connections between members and create a platform where impact could emerge. It would include not only organizing great events such as the WineDowns, Skillshare Breakfasts, but also working with all sorts of online platforms and trying to boost our community of 500+ members both on- and offline. If a start-up founder asks you “Why should we take EVS volunteers?”, what would be your answer? Firstly, you not only get the chance to have a motivated and young volunteer who can support your team but also you give them the chance to show their potential and contribute to your activities. Also, by accepting an EVS volunteer, you are opening your doors to a different culture, world views & lifestyle which can be especially stimulating for your team. Looking back at the last year, what was your personal highlight of your European Voluntary Service? By being surrounded by such a diverse community and seeing amazing things happening right in front of you, one starts to believe that nothing is impossible. Thanks to being part of Impact Hub and EVS, I was able to dissolve all the mental blocks and fears I unconsciously built within myself in those 25 years of life and started focusing on what is really important for me. Also, coming to a new city without knowing anyone is a huge challenge that can be really scary. However, looking back, I realized how many beautiful connections I have made and I am happy to leave with the feeling that I have a place I can always come back to. How has your knowledge and understanding of (social) entrepreneurship & the impact of start-ups evolved? I had very little knowledge about social entrepreneurship and the startup scene when I started. Now, I am absolutely sure about the importance of impact startups in the current world where we are standing in front of some of the most complex problems. I see them as unique tools which have the power to start the transformation process on so many levels. How do you plan to use your experience of the EVS to solve societal challenges back in Slovakia or around Europe? Do you want to start any projects/ enterprises of your own? I realized I can never go back to anything other than an “impactful” job. Currently, I am preparing myself for my next journey which is in the area of international development. Europe, Asia or Africa.. I am absolutely unsure about where exactly it takes me but that just adds the flavor to it. How would you finish the sentence “For me Impact is…” .. when you forget about your own needs and desires and focus on what the world needs.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/24/integration-ventures-changing/","ImpactHub","Integration: How these ventures are changing the world"," Integration is one of the biggest challenges our world faces today. We all have different languages, different cultures, and different ideas. But at the end of the day, despite all our so-called differences, we’re all just people looking to do our best. Here are some ventures helping those who’ve come from afar, find their way: MTOP Their mission is to bring highly skilled refugees´to the labor market, connect refugees to companies, and break down negative stereotypes. MTOP offers an advanced training program that offers various workshops, and mentoring to prepare highly qualified refugees for the labor market. They enable refugees to find work suited to their skills, knowledge and experience while helping employers find the talent they need and increase the diversity of their staff. Over 20 companies have already benefited from MTOP’s talent pool. Topfreisen Topfreisen provides a social-culinary journey based on the idea that food connects people. Refugees cook food from their home countries for events that reach local people. Their “Topfreisen Academy” is a training course for refugees in gastronomy which aims to give them an easier and more sustainable access to the labor market in Austria. Kattunfabrik Kattunfabrik–the Cuture Lab helps integrate tailors who have fled their home countries into the labor market and works to develop the regional working places of the future. There are many challenges facing the future of the textile industry and they are prepared to face them. As a NGO, they offer practical and theoretical tutorship to prepare refugees for textile job market in Austria. Habibi & Hawara They are a private and independent incubator for future entrepreneurs as well as a social training and integration project for refugees and migrants with the goal of giving them an entrepreneurial tool kit to open their own ventures. In addition, Habibi & Hawara offer secure and fairly paid jobs, training programs, and an appreciative working environment. Habibi & Hawara is known for discourse and dialog but above all, they are known for their Austrian Oriental restaurant in the center of Vienna, which serves delicious food, and provides charming, professional, and friendly service, as well as interesting, relevant, and amusing cultural events. AFYA AFYA works with traumatized refugee children and adolescents in Vienna. Their project “Teaching Recovery Techniques” provides evidence-based, low threshold support for children and adolescents suffering from trauma. In a series of workshops, children and adolescents learn to gain control over post-traumatic stress reactions. reflect Launched in April 2017, reflect is an activist clothing brand embracing a unique and sustainable design method which focuses each season on a distinct disadvantaged, and invisible community. Through the communicative power of fashion, reflect makes the invisible, visible. Conclusio Conclusio was founded with the aim to promote mutual support between Austrians and asylum seekers. An essential aspect of Conclusio is empowerment. Instead of just receiving help, asylum seekers give help and can therefore give back to the local population. They are the winners of the Sozial Marie Prize for social inclusion in 2016 and the Lions Nachhaltigkeitspreis in 2015. CARamel CARamel is a social business actively supporting the integration of refugees into the Austrian labor market by offering a sustainable and innovative way of car-cleaning: a thorough wash and wax service, both inside and outside, wherever customers’ vehicles are parked (e.g. garages of offices, hotels, e-charging stations). The majority of their team of professional valet cleaners are refugees, the cleaning process is water-free, and their travel footprint is CO2 neutral. KulturenReich KulturenReich is a social enterprise that links foreign-born women in Vienna with the Viennese business community and government. They act as a catalyst in the integration process while helping Viennese businesses gain a competitive edge from the injection of new ideas and different perspectives. Their goals are to empower foreign-born women to be financially independent and successful, support companies to reach their diversity goals while enhancing their intercultural skills, and support government by helping to facilitate the integration of immigrants and foreign women in Vienna.

Canada is ranked third in the world for social innovation. “Apparently, our beavers are doing a great job!”, laughed Draimin as he addressed the audience. The social impact sector is growing, with new ventures, enabling organizations, and investors leaping into the market. “Social innovation is globally relevant, with national strategies as a main condition”, Draimin said. “Learning is an action”, and we cannot do it by ourselves. Presenting his insights from the book “Social Innovation Generation”, Draimin emphasized networks are necessary to create impact. Draimin suggests three main aspects when considering new strategies of social innovation potential and system change: Does social innovation intersect with mainstream innovation If innovation is the goal, then we need to understand what is necessary to move forward: comprehensive innovation, social impact, integrated innovation between businesses, social, and scientific/technological innovations. However, the core element of success is to be mission-oriented and inclusive. Which means finding something you are passionate about, driving innovation in the sector forward, and including all affected stakeholders. Moreover, it means finding a way to ensure no one in society is left behind when you create something new. Collaboration lies at the core of social innovation Reshaping ecosystems starts with engaging many actors in the system and bringing them together to work towards the same goal. Finding right people with similar interests and skills is the solution to achieving social innovation. Interplay of ecosystems, networks and platforms, is on what systems change relies on. Bridging established boundaries is the future of contemporary entrepreneurship. Consequently, it is also the biggest social innovation potential. This premise further informs how companies will grow in the future. A new innovation paradigm arises from these considerations, which includes: (1) content, meaning new methods, practices and regulations; (2) processes fostering inclusivity, co-creation, improvement, empowerment, people’s involvement, and cross-sector collaboration; (3) objectives create social value within new demands and social challenges.

Not only does a reader find friends within the pages of a book, new and old, he or she gains a wealth of new information. Reading also deepens our understanding of ourselves and each other. We gain greater insight into the plight of others through the pages of a book. We experience true empathy for the characters in books which translates to people in the real world. While scientists disagree on this point slightly, what they do agree on is readers of fiction have the tools for great and deep empathy. Being able to imagine yourself in place of another is important, especially as we are likely to experience more world-wide crises like the Syrian and Venezuelan conflicts. We wanted to present a broad picture of refugees across the world, which means our selection reflects the conflicts and milieus from across time and the earth. It was difficult to pick a few books to recommend to you because there are so many. The UNHCR put together a fifteen-page list of their recommendations. The Pen is mightier … Exit West by Moshin Hamid Shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2017, this novel is a brilliant narrative about survival and open doors. Two people meet in a Middle Eastern city gripped by civil war. Nadia and Saeed fall in love. Throughout the city, doors start to appear, magical doors which, once opened, can lead to anywhere and there is no going back. Desperate to survive, Nadia and Saeed take the chance and walk through an open door. The Guardian says “[t]here are no descriptions of life-or-death journeys in the backs of lorries or on flimsy dinghies. No middle passages. Just the cognitive shock of having been freshly transplanted to tough new terrains.” While the magical realism aspect of the book eliminates the need for perilous journeys in hostile terrains Hamid does not leave out the harsh descriptions of a city gripped by war and fear, “Hamid catalogues the casual devastation of a truck bomb, the sexual molestation that takes place as hundreds of city dwellers throng to take their life savings from a bank, and the supernatural elation of taking a warm shower after weeks on the road” writes Sukhdev Sandhu for The Guardian. Monsieur Linh and His Child by Philippe Claudel We have already recommended this book but it is so good and too important not to mention a second time. This is a tale of love, loss, and unlikely friendships. Monsieur Linh has just fled conflict and clutched to his chest is his infant granddaughter. “All those who knew his name are dead,” Maya Jaggi writes in her review for The Guardian. Monsieur Linh finds his reason for living, for continuing, and for making a gruelling journey in the face of his granddaughter. After his arrival in France, and his transition from temporary accommodations Monsieur Linh meets Monsieur Bark on a park bench. Monsieur Bark is grieving the death of his wife and struggles with a difficult past. They become unlikely friends, even though they cannot speak each other’s language. Each sensing incommensurable sorrow of the other. What is the What by Dave Eggers The book is based on the true story of a Sudanese refugee living in Atlanta, Georgia, Valentino Achak Deng. While the story and the outline of the facts are true, Eggers has taken some poetic licence and presents this as a work of creative non-fiction. Achak is one of the “Lost Boys”, a group of some 4,000 boys who were running from the violent destruction of their villages and the slaughter of their families. Eggers tells the story of Achak as a boy “[o]rphaned, starving and having walked 1,000 miles across West Africa when he was eight or nine, under constant threat of random slaughter from militias and wild animals”, Tim Adams writes for The Guardian. Achak then lived for fifteen years in squatters’ camps in Ethiopia before a charity organization arranged for his immigration to the United States. At the time the book was written Achak was working to put himself through college. What Eggers achieves best in this book, perhaps more so than others, is transmitting a sense of the permanence of temporary refugee camps. Achak lived in one camp, Golkur, for ten years. In the Sea there are Crocodiles by Fabio Geda This Young Adult book presents the life story of Enaiatollah Akbadi’s journey from Afghanistan to Italy. The young boy, left by himself in a new country by his mother, undertakes a perilous and fraught journey to find a new home. The place “You recognise it because you don’t feel like leaving”Enaiat states in his conversations with the author, Fabio Geda. Geda presents a “frank, revealing and clear-eyed testament of the experiences faced by a young asylum-seeker in the contemporary world” according to Diane Samuels at The Guardian. From his work at a hostel in Iran to his payment of people traffickers in Turkey, to a perilous dinghy ride to Greece, and his eventual arrival in Italy the book is crucial to understanding the plight of young asylum seekers in Europe. Sometimes a picture is worth more … Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches from Syria, Turkey, and Iraq By Sarah Glidden This beautiful example of comic journalism tells the stories of the people whom Glidden and her journalist friends encounter while working in Syria, Turkey, and Iraq. The book spans the totality of the refugee experience, from the story of the United Nations administrator to the Iraqi refugee deported from the United States. The art work which accompanies the stories is Glidden’s signature soft watercolours.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Image-2018-03-30-at-10.53-AM-600x400.jpg","May 28, 2018","en",0.988685786724091,0.000192106432223227,0.466696623712778,0.00120433559641242,0.53190690279007
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/30/importance-words-refugee-asylum-seeker-migrant/","ImpactHub","The Importance of Words: Refugee, Asylum Seeker, or Migrant?","There has been lots of discussion about refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants over the past few years, and the terms are often used interchangeably and incorrectly–even by publications like the BBC. In reality, these terms have significant political implications for how these individuals are received into a country, the protections and rights they receive, and even how the receiving society might react to their arrival. In August 2015, the global news organization Al Jazeera announced that it would no longer refer to the people fleeing war to seek refuge in Europe as migrants, but rather as refugees. This is one example among many of the importance of consciously choosing the terms we use. Our choice of words sends a message, and using terms without thought can accidentally send messages we don’t mean. Unofficially classifying someone as a refugee or a migrant comes with certain connotations (something worth delving into deeper), but classifying them officially as such has concrete effects on their lives. For example, when the UN officially recognizes a certain group of people as refugees, they are granted different kinds of international protection that migrants do not receive. This is also why the topic can be controversial — who’s to say that migrants from other conflicts and countries don’t also need protection? Where is the line drawn when it comes to international aid? The conversation is complex and certainly multifaceted, but we can at least try to clarify one aspect of the conversation. Let’s take a look at the official differences between refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers. Refugee Refugees are people who flee persecution or war. They are seeking asylum somewhere outside of their home country because returning home is too dangerous. Refugees are officially defined and recognized by the UNHCR. They have specific protections according to international law, including the fact that they should not be sent back to their home country. Other official protections include governmental procedures (done by the receiving country’s government) to ensure they are granted safety and dignity (source). The “Refugee Crisis” in 2015 was officially acknowledged by the UNHCR that the majority of people in the movement were refugees since they were coming from recognized conflict zones and could not safely stay in their homelands. Asylum Seeker Though often interchanged with the term refugee, an asylum seeker is technically a little bit different. Every refugee is seeking asylum until the point when they are granted asylum. Sometimes people who are fleeing unrecognized conflicts or are unsafe in their home countries for other reasons seek asylum abroad. The decision of whether to recognize them as refugees depends on the individual case as well as the government of the receiving country. This decision is made with the international Refugee Status Determination (RSD) but is made primarily by the country rather than the UNHCR. The RSD process can take a very long time. If a country is not willing or able to make this determination, the UNHCR can step in to make the decision for them. Migrant A migrant is someone who decides to move, usually to seek a better life. This often to improved opportunities for work, education, or reuniting with family. The key difference between a refugee and a migrant is the fact that migrants are able to return to their home without being in danger. Migrants don’t fall under international law in the same way that refugees do. Instead, each individual country has its own set of laws for migrants (source). Because of this difference in laws for migrants and refugees, recognizing a group or an individual as one or the other can be extremely politically charged. The “Refugee Crisis,” while mostly consisting of refugees, also included smaller numbers of migrants. Further reading: Today’s protections of refugees, as well as the distinctions between refugees and migrants, are primarily defined by the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1969 OAU Refugee Convention, and the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. You can find more general information about migrants and refugees from UNHCR’s FAQ, as well as more in-depth information about the international laws on refugees on UNHCR’s website.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/31/interview-jasmin-bauer-kattunfabrik/","ImpactHub","Interview with Jasmin Bauer of Kattunfabrik","We have been focusing on refugees and migrants this month on the blog. We have a number of ventures who work with refugees. A number of them are part of our accelerator program, found!. The program is a joint initiative by Impact Hub Vienna and The Deloitte Future Fund to provide support to social entrepreneurs who are preparing refugees for the Austrian job market, creating job opportunities, or helping build independent livelihoods in their new countries. I interviewed Jasmin Bauer of Kattunfabrik, an NGO that works with tailors by training and integrating them into the job market. Kattunfabrik is a finalist of the 2018 found! program. Where does the name “Die Kattunfabrik” come from? Actually, the name derives from a special form of woven cotton – called “Kattun” in German. We started as an NGO also directly in Sankt Pölten (a bit outside Vienna), where there was, in former times, a Kattunfabrik [calico factory]. Bringing this together, it made a perfect name for our NGO. How did Kattunfabrik get its start? Where did the inspiration come from? As we saw that more and more new people were arriving in Austria, we wanted to offer them what we could, a place where they have the chance to repair their worn-out clothes. This was just the beginning. Around 20% of the refugees come from the textile industry, so a lot of questions were asked about how they can do this as their living here, how to find work, and how to qualify. We did some great research and this was the starting point of “Kattunfabrik” – a workshop open to those who want to get back in the working market. What is the mission of Kattunfabrik? We train our workshop attendants in theory and with practical advice, we give them a broad knowledge of the technical language (in German) they have to face here and we train them on how to get back in the working market after they received their asylum status. But integration into the job market isn’t our only mission. We also care a lot about sustainability, about how to broaden the knowledge about how our clothes are made, and by whom. We talk at conferences and lead workshops on this topic to give people a chance to rethink their own consumerism. What do you think are some of the main challenges refugees (and especially tailors) face when they come to a new country? The hardest thing is to get the facts right – who can work under what circumstances, are there any exam papers for their profession – as the working conditions are of course restricted here in Austria. But we believe that working is an essential part of life and of being in a community. Thankfully, a lot of businesses are working to help refugees through their relocation. What is unique about the way your organization is working to solve these challenges for the refugee community? We not only focus on free time, we directly focus on training them to get back to work. As far as we know, there is no other organization doing this this way, especially concerning the textile industry. One of our main goals is also to point out that there is so much knowledge coming to Austria now, such as techniques and focus – we can merge this with the Austrian-based knowledge and re-create new ways of working here in textiles. What are your next goals and plans for Kattunfabrik? What do you hope to get out of your time in the found! program? We have already gotten so much out of it, thanks to our trainers and mentors from Deloitte and Impact Hub. We are now expanding ourselves and are currently in the process of opening a tailor’s shop with delivery service. Our personnel are taken from Kattunfabrik’s masterclass, so we directly introduce them to the working market and find a solid job base for them. Our new project is called wearrepair.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/venture-interview--600x400.jpg","May 31, 2018","en",0.995575845241547,0.00042233444401063,0.806079864501953,0.000280615378869697,0.193217158317566

Here’s what they had to say about collaboration with the global network, continued activities in the CEE region, and development of the social innovation ecosystem in Vienna. Tell us a bit about your backgrounds. Impact Hub Vienna new leadership© Anja StevicBI: I started my journey with Impact Hub Vienna back in 2008 when I was searching for solutions on how to bring business and social ideas together for my master’s thesis. I was one of the first members and am also one of the organization’s crowd investors. It was three years ago that I left the world of corporate and NGO work and officially joined the team. I’ve been learning to speak the language of startups ever since and using my background to support the impact ecosystem. LG: I was one of Impact Hub Vienna’s first employees and worked as a project manager for our flagship accelerator program–the Investment Ready Program. Together with a small team, we built Impact Hub’s acceleration machine from the ground up. We helped scale the Social Impact Award in partnership with WU, expanded IRP into new regions and steadily added new programs to our arsenal–quite a labor of love let me tell you. FB: For the last 11 years I worked as the Chief Operating Officer for REEEP – the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, a non-profit that aims at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems in low and middle-income countries. I was responsible for internal operations (Finance, HR, Governance) and IT & Knowledge Management in the organization. Working in a multilateral environment, with so many people dedicated to improving the lives of the most vulnerable populations was an invaluable experience for me. Coming to Impact Hub was a very natural progression, as the missions are very much aligned. Impact Hub has evolved from a co-working space to a startup accelerator to a local epicenter for everything social impact. How will that take shape in the future? BI: Looking back, it’s really incredible how this organization has progressed over time. Our first business plan included a headcount of around 2.5 people. Now, we’ve got 20 employees and a mix of revenue streams. Through it all, we’ve held one core belief–we don’t just sell coworking space or accelerator programs or event space, we are building a community. That will remain true in the years to come, but we’ll take it to the next level. We’re currently working on finding more opportunities for stakeholders like corporate companies, NGOs, and government organizations to form stronger collaborations with our community and understand how their expertise and resources can contribute to building a more sustainable, inclusive world. LG: I’d add that over the years, we’ve also learned a lot about the needs of social entrepreneurs. We are focusing on how we can adapt our accelerator programs to improve our support of these founders and ensure they have the right resources and network they need to be successful. FB: I agree that we need to take Impact Hub’s core mission of community to the next level by engaging with new stakeholders, and I think we have an interesting mix of backgrounds that put us in a great position to do just that. Barbara has a legacy of work with large corporate companies, I have a background working for an international non-profit, and Lena is heavily embedded in the impact investment scene. We’ll be working on showing these stakeholders how to approach innovation through the lens of social entrepreneurship to realize the economic, social, and environmental benefits. While Impact Hub Vienna was one of the first innovation centers in Vienna, many other players have since entered the space. How do you see Impact Hub’s relationship with the competition? LG: Impact Hub started as one of the first co-working spaces and we have always been very collaborative within the co-working and startup communities. I think a lot of players in this space act as “partners in crime” because we’re all building up an ecosystem for entrepreneurial action, and in order for it to succeed we simply have to support each other’s efforts. FB: Impact Hub Vienna and our community have a very strong identity. We have been a successful innovation center for more than seven years and it’s largely a credit to the team’s dedication to building an authentic place for the local community to come together and focus on impact, sustainability, and supporting people with an entrepreneurial spirit who share our core values. I think our approach remains very unique, even with the new players entering the ecosystem. IH is a global brand, yet functions on a local base. How with your relationship with the global network continue to shape work at Impact Hub Vienna? LG: We’ve always had a strong relationship with the global network on both strategic and network levels. The global headquarters is right here in Vienna, and we’ve worked side by side with them as Impact Hub grew from 20 Hubs to over 110. Impact Hub, as well as our members, benefit immensely from the cross-collaboration. Looking forward, we as a network are working on how to better connect our members cross-regionally, so an entrepreneur in Seattle can easily connect with a founder in Singapore to share knowledge and insights. There is incredible potential in our global network and we’re still exploring all the ways we can leverage this community. FB: Agreed. There are over 6400 startups in 50+ countries in our network–a huge asset to Impact Hub Vienna, our partners, and our members. For social impact startups, the opportunities such a network allows when they begin to scale operations into new locations is invaluable. BI: We’re also always learning from other Impact Hub’s and visit them often to get introduced to their models. We tap into each other’s expertise in community building, hosting, and use our collective knowledge as a network to better serve our community and support the movement of social innovation globally. We also frequently host other Impact Hub teams to share our journey and lessons learned, as Impact Hub Vienna is considered a center of excellence within our network. Impact Hub Vienna has expanded its accelerator programs throughout Europe and beyond. What do you see as Impact Hub’s role in continuing these programs throughout Central and Eastern Europe? LG: Our Investment Ready Program was set up as an international project since the beginning as was Social Impact Award. Each of these programs grew internationally with Impact Hub Vienna as their headquarters. It’s really a testament to the fact that this team and partners in this region are key actors in the spread of social entrepreneurship. Now, Social Impact Award has grown so much it’s become its own entity operating in over 20 countries. Impact Hub Vienna will continue to focus especially on the development of social impact in the CEE region. Currently, we work closely with partners like the Austrian Development Agency to develop projects in the western Balkan region, which we will continue to do in the year to come. Our regional activities help these countries learn about the potential of social entrepreneurship and build academies.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/06/illustration-one-man-show/","ImpactHub","Illustration is a One Man Show"," Coming across the beautiful, carefully crafted drawings beside text always made me wonder, how do they come to be? What does it take to translate text into an illustration? I sought answers from the talented illustrator Marina Muun, who has already built an impressive portfolio of inspiring illustrations. During her four-year long freelance career, she contributed to Nature, The Wall Street Journal, Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls, and many more. During warm Friday afternoon, we met on the sunny terrace where she shared her illustration journey with me. Wall Street Journal© Marina Muun“Elucidating written concepts is the biggest challenge, but also the greatest strength an illustrator can possess”, admits Marina. It is a skill which develops over time, “usually you have to come up with something interesting, witty, or poetic “. But it’s not just a pure representation of the text, the illustration also has to add to it and reveal something hidden to the reader. “That develops your conceptual thinking”, mused Marina. With a bunch of colorful drawings spread across the table, I tried to understand the depth of the call. “You need to move within the space where you are always trying to reinvent your work, stay true to your style, otherwise, you can get bored”, continues Muun, adding that for a freelancer it is pretty hard to divide a personal and professional time. “I don’t give myself office hours, and I love working outside.” Even though illustration can be solitary work, it is certainly never monotonous. There are always different things to explore, depending on the variety and pace of the projects. Sometimes it is an editorial or children’s book drawing, but it can also be a big commercial campaign. Marina is receptive to the wide spectrum. “There can be beauty in everything”, she adds, smiling. © Marina MuunIn the process of developing the next illustration, it is important to focus and find a satisfying creative solution, for both the client and the illustrator. “Making the right communicative message is the goal. In personal work, it is similar. A bit more fluid, but I give myself a task, and then I try to figure it out”, explained Muun. As we talk more about the sometimes strenuous creation process, an interesting thought comes ahead. “Creativity is trying to say something, a manifestation of person’s expression. When I look at art that I like, it is usually because it spoke to me and said something that I appreciate. It can be just the colors or the combination of the symbols. It is so subtle and abstract, hard to define.” Seeking for inspiration doesn’t seem to be an issue in a digital world, where online libraries serve the purpose. “As browse through it, sometimes I just wonder why did I ever save this weird thing”, says Marina laughingly. You never know when a certain symbol or image might come in handy. UC Davis© Marina MuunDeveloping a certain style is the absolute imperative in the field. Illustrators are known for their distinctive use of color, shapes and drawings, that set them apart and guarantee fitting commissions. Each illustrator crafts their own field of activity, some lean towards fine art, others into motion or murals. It depends on each person, “how they push out the walls of their bubble”, explains Marina. Ultimately, this doesn’t create competition, since each individual is hired because of their expertise. For Marina, her style, or brand came natural, not planned. “I do tend to use some colors more often, but it is a very spontaneous choice. They end up looking similar, because it is just my sensibility about the color”, says Muun. With increasing demand for new skills, such as motion and animation, her unfulfilled dream it to team up with a motion designer and work on an interdisciplinary project. For now she wishes to work more the books.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RockGarden-600x400.jpg","June 6, 2018","en",0.985194325447083,0.000194248234038241,0.230598151683807,0.00054107588948682,0.768666565418243
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/13/radical-candor-work/","ImpactHub","Radical Candor: What is it and how does it work?"," Do you ever want to be honest, but are worried about being too honest? Radical Candor™ allows you to establish a management framework where you can challenge your co-workers directly while caring for them personally. Being professional often means biting your tongue. But sometimes the truth needs to be said. A failing of many organizations is the lack of honest communication. Programs or initiatives are sometimes executed poorly because nobody felt like they could point out flaws. This isn’t just an issue with big multi-national corporations with thousands of employees. Impact Hub Vienna has also looked to Radical Candor for guidance. After our introduction to the core concepts of Radical Candor, we chat with Dušan Jankovic, Community Catalyst at Impact Hub Vienna to dig into a first-hand practical application of Radical Candor to see how it has impacted his team. What is Radical Candor? Radical Candor comes from the book, Radical Candor: Be a Kickass boss without Losing your Humanity, by Kim Scott, a former Google employee who led AdSense and YouTube, who was inspired by the leadership of her boss at that time, a certain Sheryl Sandberg of now Facebook and Lean In fame. How does it work? Given our general propensity to beat around the bush, we have been taught to talk around things instead of talking about things. This is in part due to the desire of avoiding any social awkwardness, which we all know can be quite uncomfortable. Radical Candor sets up an environment where the things that need to be said, will be said. At its core, Radical Candor has 2 dimensions: Care Personally and Challenge Directly. You put those two together and you get this very nice equation for the math people out there who don’t like numbers: Radical Candor = Care Personally + Challenge Directly. It’s not about confrontation or awkwardness. It’s about getting to the truth of the matter. What is Care Personally? Care Personally is about caring for your team and caring about the work. In order to facilitate a caring relationship with your team, you need to open up to them and talk more than just shop. You are a person who is more than their job so don’t be afraid to show your team that. What is Challenge Directly? Challenge Directly is about challenging your team to do their best. You also need to set the tone of being direct and honest. Your co-workers and subordinates will pick up on that and embrace how you cut straight to the point. Keep in mind though, the goal is not to be mean, it’s to be helpful. How do you do it? Like anything, practice makes perfect. Implement it in your team and do the 3 P’s of practice, practice, and practice. It might feel uncomfortable at times, especially at the start, but that might mean you’re taking it personally which is what you shouldn’t be doing. But hey, don’t listen to me, I just write about it. Let’s check in now with Dušan to see how Radical Candor really works. What inspired you to implement Radical Candor? I wanted to look into how we can embody the benefits of Radical Candor at Impact Hub Vienna. I wanted to develop a culture of direct and clear feedback that would be shared instantly while creating stronger personal bonds within the team. If we can achieve this, we would be able to continuously grow as individuals and as a team, allowing us to have more impact. Have you noticed any disadvantages? We’re adopting a phased implementation so it’s still too early to say anything definitive but I have not seen any major disadvantages so far. There are challenges though, mainly to do with getting other people on-board and changing the team culture. Although people who are part of our team are open-minded and fast learners, changing the culture is always tough! So for anybody out there taking their first Radical Candor steps, a good starting point is to make sure to introduce everyone to the concept and have buy-in from the entire team. After that, it’ll still take some time so be patient with the culture change. How has Radical Candor changed your relationships and meetings? So far, we’ve only had one “all hands” meeting where we were sharing what worked in the previous period (successes) and what could have been better (learnings). People really enjoyed it! Right now, we’re looking into how to integrate this as part of our regular agenda during our “all hands” meetings. I feel that with this framework, we’re becoming more effective in terms of the way we communicate When it comes to relationships, what helped me was the clear distinction between the “care personally” and “challenge directly” concepts that Radical Candor is based on. So on a personal level, I feel that the quality of interactions and the time spent with the team has improved. Do you plan to continue using Radical Candor? Definitely! Although, we’re not going line by line by the book. We’re adjusting the approach as we go so we can learn and use the things that work for us. The next step would be to take it outside of our team and spread it throughout the organization.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/19/sustainable-holidays/","ImpactHub","Taking a Sustainable Holiday","“A sustainable approach to tourism means that neither the environment nor the host communities will be impaired by the arrival of tourists. On the contrary, they should benefit from tourism, both economically and culturally.” UNESCO and World Tourism Organisation (2000) Everything in the way we live our lives can be sustainable. It starts with environmental consciousness and the realization we have control over how to use time, products, vehicles, and everything else in our daily lives. the idea of a sustainable lifestyle is on the rise, across all sectors. To this end, sustainable tourism is becoming increasingly popular. Last year was marked as International Year of Sustainable Tourism by the The United Nations. The goal was to raise global awareness about how responsible and sustainable tourism can have a positive impact. The main suggestions given to achieve this included environmentally conscious practices, cultural and natural heritage protection, and providing social and economic benefits for local communities. Leading sustainable lifestyle starts with small steps. You might decide, one day, to travel by bike or train, or simply walk around the city. Or you might decide to recycle more, reuse old containers, compost, or not buy a new article of clothing when one might be repaired. All of these small choices lead to a more sustainable lifestyle. With this in mind, it is important to consider the upcoming holiday season. If you are in the midst of planning your vacation, we have pulled together some important tips and insider considerations for taking a sustainable holiday. Green Destinations and Eco-tourism Almost every country has a dedicated green destination. The Green Destinations named top 100 places in 2017 that are the leading example for sustainable tourism. Ensuring the integrity of the ecosystem is what the purposeful travel to natural areas is all about. Understanding the culture and history of the environment, while taking care of the surroundings, makes the perfect ecotourist. For those who are staying in Vienna, fear not, because the city has a lot to offer as a green destination. According to the Wien Tourismus, you can visit one of the largest organic farms in Austria. Spread over 860 hectares, three city farms cultivate organic land. To spend a sustainable day in the city, this guide may come handy. Yoga Retreats This globally popular activity is getting more attention, especially when it comes to healthy and conscious interaction with the environment. Yoga retreats offer physical and mental regeneration in a sustainable community of like-minded people. Daily exercises and meditations, vegetarian and vegan kitchens, and following nature’s cycle are the keys to sustainability on these much vaunted holiday trips. Tree Houses Or why not choosing one of popular tree houses, such as Baumhaus Lodge in the Lower Austria. Holidaying in a treehouse has never been more earth conscious.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/map-600x400.jpg","June 19, 2018","en",0.992376148700714,0.00840502791106701,0.870127439498901,0.00430829124525189,0.117159307003021
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/20/get-your-sparkle-party-pants-on/","ImpactHub","Get Your Sparkle Party Pants On …","Impact Hub Vienna is turning 8! We have curated some amazing cake recipes for you. However, as we were searching the internet and cookbooks to find the best recipes, we realized we didn’t know the origins of Birthday Cake. The Surprising History of Birthday Cake According to Reader’s Digest, the origins of birthday celebrations are in the ancient world. More specifically, the Ancient Egyptians. “They believed when pharaohs were crowned, they became gods, so their coronation day was a pretty big deal. That was their “birth” as a god,” Reader’s Digest writes. One can only imagine the level of lavishness of the food at those celebrations. However, modern birthday cakes have their origin in this part of the world, specifically Germany. Reader’s Digest writes children in eighteenth century Germany would receive a cake on the morning of their birthday, called Kinderfeste, and then would not eat it until after dinner. I would call this a more intense version of the marshmallow test. As with any form of dessert across Europe at the time, money and ingredients limited access. Which means only the wealthy children had Kinderfeste. According to Reader’s Digest, birthday celebrations and cakes did not become popular until the Industrial Revolution because of the cost. The Industrial Revolution brought the beginnings of automated production, the burgeoning middle class with disposable income, and the opening of trade routes across the planet. All three factors coalesced into more people being able to celebrate birthdays with cake. Which is awesome. Cake Before and After Okay, we just wanted to take a few minutes to talk about modern cake invented in the Industrial Revolution and cake before. I learned this all from Great British Bake Off when Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc chatted with various food historians in England’s far flung manor houses. Cake prior to advances made in the Industrial Revolution were made of flour, yeast, honey, dried fruit, and nuts. Think Kugelhopf. However, bakers cultivated yeast by leaving the flour and water in a bowl. Alternatively, cakes could also be tortes, which is a flatter cake made with no leavening agent. Think Sacher Torte. Baking Powder was not invented until 1843 by Alfred Bird and then we started using that to make cake. Which is how we get the lighter fluffier cakes. Think Black Forest Cake or Lemon Poppy Seed Cake. Or any of the light and eggy French cakes or any cake which Mary Berry has ever made. The proliferation of refined sugar also made cakes different. Sugar combined with eggs to form airy peaks and create more rise in a cake. The same could not be accomplished with honey or beetroot sugar. This results in a lighter, airier cake with a soft crumb and an even texture. I am pretty sure I just quoted something Paul Hollywood says in every cake episode of Great British Bake Off. We Have Dessert, Now Let’s Light it on Fire Birthday candles also have their origin in the ancient world. This time we have the Ancient Greeks to thank, according to Reader’s Digest. They used to bake moon shaped cakes as an offering to Artemis. They would light candles on the cakes to imitate the light of the moon. Again, the modern incarnation of the tradition originates in Germany. According to Reader’s Digest, the Kinderfeste cake would have candles to equal the age of the child plus one extra, called the light of life. Reader’s Digest says the candles burnt all day and the child would blow all the candles out after dinner. The Good Stuff We baked a cake last year. It was vegan. And it was delicious. You should check out our recipe, which we made especially for you, the Impact Hub Vienna community. However, if vegan coconut cake is not your thing, and we understand, we found some other recipes for you. However, it is hard to tick all the boxes of vegan, gluten free, or seasonal all in one cake. We found the best recipes in all those categories for you. While our cake is vegan, some people like chocolate better than coconut. This recipe even comes with an extraordinarily indulgent frosting. Avocado is the fat used in the recipe and in the frosting in place of butter. This one is also gluten free, because they use a pre-made gluten free flour blend. If you do not like eating gluten free things you can substitute regular or cake flour instead. The best gluten free cake I have found is from Nigella Lawson. Her recipe for clementine almond cake is soft and moist. This is one of my favourite cakes and the one I make for myself. You can frost this with orange cream cheese icing. The batter is thick and tastes bitter, so don’t try to eat it before you bake it. Once baked, the sweetness from the almonds, the clementine juice, and the actual sugar make cake heaven. It is currently cherry season. I cannot go into a grocery store without seeing the glossy dark red, slightly sour fruit. Really, we just chose this for the frosting and filling. Also, because who doesn’t want a three-layer birthday cake covered with chocolate ganache, cherries, chocolate chips, and cherry frosting? Don’t forget… If you want to enjoy cake in a party atmosphere with all of us at Impact Hub Vienna, don’t forget that it is our birthday party on today. See you there!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/26/storytelling-business/","ImpactHub","Storytelling for Business","Your company might have something important to tell its audience, but if you don’t tell it in the right way, then it’s not going to be heard. That’s where storytelling comes in. You already know your product or service is great, but getting someone else to buy into it is another story (pun intended) altogether. The thing is, storytelling doesn’t always come naturally — it comes with practice. You could read a dozen how-to guides on the internet for how to tell a story, or you could check out courses, consulting agencies, and more that will let the experts make sure you’re telling a good story. Let’s look at some of the resources out there for really getting good at storytelling. Courses, events, and resources If you’ve looked at Impact Hub’s calendar recently, you might have noticed that we’re hosting a company called EPIX for an event on June 15th for an Empathy and Storytelling workshop. Even if you can’t make that event (or have already missed it), there are lots of other events out there for learning how to become a good storyteller. Keep an eye on the Impact Hub calendar, but also check out other similar events or courses hosted elsewhere. Other events hosted in Vienna include storytelling workshops (such as this one led by Rafal Bojar). There are also consulting agencies that you might want to look into, especially if you haven’t done much with storytelling before. Agencies and consultants in Vienna include Ferras, .kloos, zukunvt, The Story Dude, and lots more. Of course, not every up-and-coming business has the capital to spend on attending expensive workshops. Sometimes the fest resource is the one right at our fingertips: the World Wide Web. Webinars are often available, as are online courses and articles with hints, tips, and tricks. Free or cheap online courses can be found at Coursera, Future Learn, Udemy, and other similar websites. You can also sign up for email courses offered by companies such as ECHO Storytelling Agency. There are tons of other ways to get some tips and tricks for becoming a good storyteller. Books going back thousands of years teach about how to persuade and communicate a story. Luckily, there are plenty of books written for this era, too. Check out The Story Factor by Annette Simmons or Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip and Dan Heath. In case you couldn’t tell, there are tons of resources out there. All you really need is the will to learn, and you can get good at storytelling for your business using whatever route works best for you.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/28/summer-reads-learning-on-the-beach/","ImpactHub","Summer Reads: Learning on the Beach"," It is a beautiful sunny day outside (except for the day I spent writing this post). The temperature inside and outside is more like a Finnish sauna than most people think is reasonable (again, except for the day I decided to sit down and write). All we want to do is go for a swim and sit in the shade of a tree doing absolutely nothing, (EXCEPT for the day I decided to tell you all about the books you should take to the beach). We know you don’t want to take your laptop to the beach, not to mention the risk of it being stolen or ruined by a stray piece of hard plastic from a random beach activity. And no one wants to read business books when it is gloriously sunny and warm. However, you can learn from fiction and creative non-fiction. In case you missed it, we chatted about that exact subject in the book round up on Refugees. We scoured the internet and our bookshelves for the best summer reads. Some of these are light hearted and others examine the complex nature of humanity through tragedy. However, all of these are worth the read on a sunny day. On the Shelves … The Girl Who Smiled Beads: A Story of War and What Comes After – Clemantine Wamariya Clemantine Wamariya is a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. She is six years old when she starts her story, her parents are speaking in whispers and her neighbours start to disappear. Wamariya and her older sister spent six years running through seven countries, hoping with each one to find a haven. Eventually, they sought asylum in the United States. Wamariya’s story encompasses the horrors of war, the true costs, and the after effects for survivors. For those working in migration, inclusion, and with refugees this book is an absolute necessity. For the rest of us, this book is an absolute necessity to better understand the predicament of those who find themselves newly displaced. Calypso – David Sedaris David Sedaris’ exercises his characteristic wit and charm in this latest collection of emotionally charged essays. Sedaris confronts his sister’s suicide, revisits the loss of his mother, his own health and mortality, and attempts to emotionally cope with the new frailty age forced on his father. The book fundamentally questions what it means to be a family when people live far apart and see each other infrequently, especially as age catches up with us all. Some essays are the expected Sedaris family antics, others chronicle the reasons why he now has a garbage truck named after him and met the Queen of England (it is the same reason), or Sedaris’ desire to feed his recently excised fatty tumour to a snapping turtle. This book is just necessary. I can write lovely sentences about how this is essential for those working in mental health and social inclusion. Or about how, if you are struggling to laugh or see the bright side you should read this book. Described as “cheerfully misanthropic” on the back cover the stories are heart-warming and incisive in a way only Sedaris can be. The Book of M – Peng Shepherd This is a stunning debut novel by Peng Shepherd. A global catastrophe hits, people are losing their shadows and with them their memories. The book begins with a shadowless man speaking perfect English walking into a fire because he forgot what it was. The fantasies of the shadowless are becoming reality. The story follows Max and Ory. Max loses her shadow and Ory pursues her, not willing to give up the time left with their shared memories. The book questions the power of connection when your world is turning upside down. Magical and heartbreaking this book is a must read for everyone working in a constantly shifting world or for anyone trying to find their feet in this ever-moving sea. From the way back machine … Never Let Me Go – Kazuo Ishiguro Kazuo Ishiguro is 2017’s Nobel Laureate in Literature. This is a book is earth shattering. The novel presents us the reader with halcyon school days and summer afternoons spent in cottages watching rain storms. The three teenagers around whom the book revolves are caught up in the dramas of adolescence: dating, love triangles, shelving artistic dreams, and other such problems we all confront on the cusp of adulthood. A deep sense of hopelessness pervades the book. The children at this beautiful school in a rambling old country manor are human organ farms. I love this book and keep coming back to it. Everyone should read this book. It is an attempt to understand what makes us human and what connects us to each other. Good things come to those who wait … Severance – Ling Ma Ling Ma brings us a world brought down by a swift and sweeping plague. However, the main character, Candace Chen, is so focused on her daily life and routine she almost doesn’t know what is happening outside the tiny box she has made of her life. Part apocalyptic novel, with mindless zombies continuously refolding t-shirts instead of devouring grey-matter, and part meditation on the Chinese immigrant experience, the millennial main character is the daughter of immigrants. Ma won a prize for a chapter of this novel in 2015. This book is essential for anyone looking to break out of the drudgery of every day, meaningless jobs, or change capitalism. I have only read reviews because the book does not hit shelves until August but it is one of the most eagerly anticipated reads of the summer. A picture is worth a thousand words … The Prince and the Dressmaker – Jen Wang Jen Wang brings us a powerful and beautifully drawn tale of the power of friendship and the danger in being a secret. This graphic novel tells the tale of two people who are secrets, Prince Sebastian and his friend, Frances. Prince Sebastian sometimes wears dresses and takes the world by storm as Lady Crystallia. Frances is the dressmaker who makes his fantastic frocks, she is his secret weapon. His life is secret from everyone but two people, especially his parents who are pressuring him to marry a woman, any woman. Frances is Prince Sebastian’s secret. This distinctly modern fairy tale is a heart-warming and romantic story of friendship. If these books don’t suit your fancy, or if you would actually rather read business books on the beach. We have tonnes of other recommendations. You can check out our top recommendations for entrepreneurs, futurism, inspiring women, tech for good – analog edition, leading ladies, messes, and sticking to it.

The first module of the program took place in April, while the local cohort meetup was in May. This month Module 2 will take place. So, what does all this mean for the ventures? The program itself consists of four months of personalized support from experts, business tools, and resources. At the end of the four months, the ventures will then get to participate at CEE Impact Day, where they can pitch to investors to help secure the future of their business. The Investment Ready Program is valued at €15,000 for each venture, although it’s hard to quantify the value of gaining a network of useful resources. Better yet, it lasts for a lot longer than just the initial 4 month period. IRP keeps in touch with its alumni and will keep networking along the way for at least two years after the start of the program. So far, IRP has already helped out 90 ventures. This Year’s Ventures There are 15 impactful ventures involved in the program this year. They’re located in Austria, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Kosovo. Their industries range from food and nutrition to manufacturing, from arts and culture to lifestyle and fashion, from agriculture to education, and more. All of the ventures are aimed at making a positive impact in their communities and in the world. Some, such as the restaurant Freshys, donate a large portion of their profits to the needy (food for the homeless, in their case), while others specifically employ and train people with disabilities (as is the case the IT company HubIT). There are quite a few ventures focused on health and sustainability in connection with food or food production this year, such as Hut & Stiel, MamaOrgana, No Name Farm, Vrtlari, and Hrana Za Site.

We want healthier workplaces because we spend so much time there during the week. The World Health Organization (WHO) says “healthy workers are more productive and raise healthy families.” Healthy workplaces are one of the key strategies for alleviating poverty, according to the WHO primer on Occupational Health and Safety. However, you might be a freelancer, a small start-up with only a few employees, a “solo-preneur,” or any number of other categories in which you find yourself looking to keep yourself healthy while you work because there is no formal employee wellness program (unless you make it for yourself). We pulled together some tips for staying healthy during the workday. Everything from taking the stairs instead of the elevator (you know who you are) to issues with eye strain. Get Up and Move Around Take the Stairs This is a simple option. There are a few short flights of stairs to the first floor from the main floor. Even taking them once a day is better for you and the environment. It builds up your cardiovascular health and you will gradually get stronger, according to MyFitness Pal. However, there is a mental health benefit too, according to the popular healthy lifestyle app blog. “Every time someone makes a decision to start a new healthy habit, especially something physical, it ends up being what is referred to as a ‘keystone habit,’ which makes starting other habits easier — kind of like a domino effect,” the blog reports. Researchers at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada found taking the stairs helps to slow brain aging. We have given you at least four good reasons for your physical health to take the stairs one floor up, however, there is a benefit for the environment as well. The benefit here is simple, you save energy by not using a mechanical lift and reduce yours and the Hub’s carbon footprint, according to an article in The Guardian. Walk Everywhere We know you do not work in a traditional office environment because you work here with us. However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be walking to or from meetings. If your meetings are close by then take a walk. If not, then walk from the nearest ubahn rather than taking a ride share or a bus which will drop you off at the door. The benefits of walking are endless. The Mayo Clinic reports everything from a trimmer waistline to strengthening bones and muscles. Also, the time away from your desk will give you a chance to clear your mind. Stretch It Out Stretching has a myriad of benefits. We usually incorporate it into our daily exercise routines. However, incorporating stretching into your routines at other points in the day has unexpected benefits. According to the Baltimore Business Journal, stretching decreases your risk of repetitive strain injuries associated with offices work and increases your productivity. Food and Drink Water That simple word should be enough. However, it can sometimes be hard to get all the water your body needs in a day. According to The Greatist, water can help boost your productivity, fight sickness, and reduce eye strain. Try setting an alert in your phone or fitness tracker if you struggle to get enough water during the work day. Food Healthy eating is important, like water, it can boost productivity and fight sickness. Eating fruits and vegetables have a myriad of wonderous benefits. We really do not need to list them here. Try buying fresh vegetables from the nearest grocery store, to which you walked on your break, or try packing a sack lunch. Eye Health Have you heard about the 20-20-20 rule? This means taking a twenty second break, every twenty minutes, and looking at something twenty feet away (about six meters). Medical News Today reports this can help you prevent eye strain while you are using the computer intensely. According to the Mayo Clinic, eye strain can cause not just dry eyes but headaches and neck problems. Remember, take a break. Go for a walk. You will be more productive if you feel energized and you are not in pain. Happy, healthy working.

We are serious. Inc. reports reading is “one of the best ways to get that disengaged rest.” If you are not a meditator, not all of us are or can be, you can achieve the same peaceful relaxation through reading. We have pulled together a list of some of the best meditative reading around. The benefits of reading fiction are myriad and surprising. According to the same article in Inc., reading is one of the most effective ways to combat stress. Within six minutes of starting to read our heart rate slows and our muscles release their tension, according to research performed at the University of Sussex. Regular fiction readers also report sleeping better, according to Inc.. Readers of fiction have better lifelong cognitive function, showing less characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia as they age, according to The National Academy of Sciences. And these are just the health benefits. Our advice, head to the bookstore and pick up one of these recommendations to help you rest. On the Shelves … The Sea, The Sea – Iris Murdoch Originally published in 1978, The Sea, The Sea examines what drives us all. And the face we present to the world. The story follows playwright and director, Charles Arrowby, as he attempts to write his memoirs but just end up falling in love with his adolescent crush all over again. The book won the Booker prize that year. However, we did not recommend it for Arroby’s self-aggrandising reflections or for the kidnapping plot that goes horribly awry. Murdoch is also a philosopher. In her paper, The Sublime and The Good, Murdoch postulates we need art and beauty to learn and understand the higher moral truths. The Guardian writes the book is “variously sublime, ridiculous, difficult, facile, profound and specious.” The prose is complex and detail oriented, including the descriptions of many off-putting meals had at Arrowby’s new home by London’s theatrical set. Give yourself a few hours of rest and enjoy the quirky comic nature of this philosophical read. Such a Long Journey – Rohinton Mistry I read this book when I was seventeen and it remains one of my favourites. It is a work of fiction I return to repeatedly. Mistry’s novel follows Gustad Noble, a bank clerk and member of the Parsi community in Mumbai in 1971. It follows Noble through the daily interactions of his life to major family events, like a son refusing to go to a prestigious school or a daughter becoming ill. The tender side of Noble comes out in his daily interactions with his neighbour, Tehmul, who has cognitive disabilities. Amidst government plots, gargantuan sums of money, and painting the walls of his apartment building with all the world’s deities to prevent people urinating near his windows, Noble discovers who he is and for what he stands. Winner of the Governor General’s Award in Canada, it is a spectacular meditation on the person in turmoil. I would highly recommend this literary tour de force from one of Canada’s great authors. Rebecca – Daphne Du Maurier Du Maurier dares to give us a protagonist without a name, only a role, Mrs. De Winter, Mistress of Manderley. Rebecca is the name of Mr. de Winter’s first wife. The novel is rife with self-doubt and fear. The narrator’s anxiety is palpable in every glove dropped. The reader pulled deeply into the world of Manderley, from the sophisticated and suave Maxim de Winter to the spiteful housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Du Maurier leaves no stone unturned in this psychological exploration, even looking at the thoughts leading to suicide and the bullying behaviour of those around us. The Novel Cure, a compendium dedicated to helping readers find solace for their emotional ailments with the exact perfect book, recommends this book for those suffering from low self-esteem. Less – Andrew Sean Greer Winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize, this book is a meditation on aging in a world which increasingly leaves the aged behind. The protagonist is Arthur Less, who is a minor novelist, white, gay, and knocking on the door of fifty years old. These are his meanderings through the world on various literary engagements. He is avoiding turning fifty company and the wedding of his one-time lover. The Guardian writes “novels about novelists are always a risk, but Less is about anyone who has allowed their calling to define them at the expense of their humanity.” This is for anyone who struggles with purpose in their daily life. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words … How to Survive in the North – Luke Healy This is an irresistible story with arresting pictures. The narrative is three distinct stories, two real life arctic expeditions weave seamlessly with a fictional present-day character. The stark colour palette is reminiscent of the aurora borealis, which finds its way into all tales of arctic exploration, including these three stories. The work is a meditation on life in harsh conditions, survival, and what it means to be human. Student reviewers at Concordia writes Healy’s work “combines two stories of isolation to create a stunning look at human emotion.” The narrative has two distinct notes with respect to isolation. The first is being physically isolated, as Ada is, alone on an island. The second is isolation in the modern age, as Sully is, when he is on sabbatical weathering the storm of his affair with a student. This book explores what it means to be truly alone. If you want more fiction, we have been recommending quite a few books recently, last month’s list encompassed fiction across a broad array of subjects.

However, we have yet to talk about food, one of the key ingredients to good health. We asked two of our food ventures to give us some delicious summer recipes. Habibi & Hawara Habibi & Hawara sent us their delicious falafel recipe, and it also happens to be Aboudi’s mother’s recipe. While it is not specifically super healthy it is so delicious that the happiness you get from eating it will be the health benefit. Aboudi’s Falafel Serves 4 people Ingredients 250g dried chickpeas 1/2 large onion, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander 1/2 tbsp dried coriander 1/2 tbsp cumin Juice of 1 lemon Scent of salt 1/2 tsp baking powder Oil for baking Instructions Soak the chick peas in plenty of water for at least 12 hours, and preferably for 24hours(if you are in a hurry, 500g canned and drained chickpeas will do too.) Drain the water and pour the drained chick peas together with the onion, garlic, parsley and coriander (fresh and dried) into your blender or food processor, and (using the finest blade) pulse until everything is blended but not pureed. Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl. Add the lemon juice, baking powder, salt and cumin to the mixture and stir well. Heat the oven to 200°C and cover a baking tray with baking paper and lightly grease. Roll the mixture into small balls of about 3 to 4 cm. Place on the prepared tray and lightly brush the balls with oil. Put the balls in the oven at 200°C for approximately 20 minutes, turning after 10 minutes. Bake until the falafel is crisp and golden. Enjoy with friends and family. And what do you serve with falafel? Tabouleh, of course. This healthy salad is also courtesy of our friends at Habibi & Hawara. Habibi & Hawara’s Syrian Tabouleh Vegan; serves 6 people Ingredients 2 bunches of parsley 1 cucumber Juice of 2 lemons A handful of mint leaves (Instead of mint you can also prepare the Tabouleh with lemon balm). A garlic clove 3 Tomatoes Some black olives to taste 1 bunch of spring onion 1 cup bulgur (fine) Pomegranate seeds Salt and pepper 1/2 cup olive oil of good (organic) quality 1 cup of cold water Instructions Swell bulgur in cold water and lemon juice for about 5 minutes. Due to the lemon juice, the bulgur also softens with cold water. Loosen with a fork – the grain should be loose crumbly. If necessary, add a little more water. Finely chop the onion, garlic and herbs and mix with olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl. For the tomatoes, core the seeds, cut into small pieces. Peel cucumber, halve lengthways and remove seeds with teaspoon, dice. Roughly chop olives. Put everything in the salad bowl and mix. Fold in bulgur as evenly as possible. You should taste the salad and, if necessary, season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Leave in the fridge until the next day. Garnish with pomegranate seeds. Enjoy! Tip: Serve as a starter or side dish or for barbecues, also refreshing as a main course in summer. Koch Doch Barbara at Koch Doch, a venture devoted to organizing community lunches and our community lunch organizer on Thursdays, shared with us her favourite salad to cool down during Vienna’s hot summer days. Cucumber-Tomato-Salad with Mint Leaves and Lemon Balm Ingredients 1 small cucumber (washed, sliced) 300 g cherry tomatoes (cut in halves) Nana-mint-leaves (chopped) Lemon balm leaves (chopped) Juice of half a lemon (or any mild fruit vinegar) 2 tablespoons of olive oil Salt Pepper Instructions Mix and enjoy! BONUS: Easily and quickly prepared, it makes a nice snack and is very refreshing. All the ingredients are seasonal and regionally produced – apart from …. take a guess. Recipe Alternatives TIP 1: Use orange juice and spearmint-leaves. TIP 2: For a main course, add steamed couscous or cooked millet. We hope you enjoy these recipes as much as we did.

We’re all busy, so how do you get the information you need without wasting your time? There are so many documentaries and other resources out there that it can easily make your head spin. To simplify things at least a little bit, we’ve compiled a list of 5 health-focused documentaries worth your time. Food, Inc. Made by Robert Kenner, this documentary opens our eyes to the food industry of the United States. It delves into the unpleasant realities, even the ones that are endorsed by the governmental regulatory agencies. It shows us that just a few corporations put prioritize profit over just about anything else. Whether it’s workers’ health, new strains of diseases, or widespread obesity, Food, Inc. opens our eyes to it all. Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret Cowspiracy forces us to examine the truth behind an industry that many prefer not to think about: animal agriculture. The major environmental impacts of this harmful industry are clarified, but that’s not all. You’ll also be amazed at the reluctance of the environmental organizations to really do much — or even talk much — about it. Believe it or not, you’ll find yourself laughing along with the humor in this enlightening documentary. Forks Over Knives Forks Over Knives is a thoughtful documentary that examines obesity and disease in our society. It highlights the fact that obesity (particularly in the United States) is worse than ever, the number of diabetes cases is skyrocketing, and prescription drugs are running rampant. It looks at a possible (and likely) solution: skipping processed and animal-based meals. You’ll be so impressed with this doc that you might go vegan without a second thought. You can find it on Netflix. Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead This film follows the life of Joe Cross, who is obese and goes on a mission to get his health back. It shows how he can’t get much from doctors or medicine, so he instead goes for his last remaining option: changing what he eats. He takes it to the extreme by cutting out everything besides vegetable and fruit juices for two months while traveling across the United States and interviewing fellow Americans about health and food. If you’re in need of a little inspiration to live a healthier life, this one is for you. Fast Food Nation Although not technically a documentary, this movie is loosely based on the book, also titled Fast Food Nation. It tells the story of the marketing director of a fictional fast-food chain. After a scandal, he goes to investigate one of the company’s meat processing plants to uncover the truth. It is a comedy-drama that will both entertain and open your eyes to the parallels between this fictional world and our own.

I know that might be a controversial statement for some but let’s face it, winter starts and ends later than ever and I’m dripping sweat as a write this from my cave. These movies aren’t 100% accurate to the climate science but in movies, what is? If you want to experience climate change from the comfort of your home, leave the AC off and check out the following movies. The Day After Tomorrow Like many, I paid to see this glorious entry in director Roland Emmerich’s never-ending oeuvre of destruction extravanganzas. Due to climate change, a series of super storms develop above Canada, Scotland, and Siberia and the weather everywhere goes apeshit. Characters try to explain what’s happening but then end up running away from climate-related disasters that can kill them. Jake Gyllenhaal at one point has to outrun really rapidly advancing frost. What more do you need to know? Geostorm As weirdly interesting as this movie is, it’s probably the last one you should make a point of watching on this list. It stars Gerard Butler who once again swaps his charming Scottish brogue for a North American accent. The plot concerns people who need to shut down malfunctioning natural disaster causing climate-controlling satellites which were put in place to stabilize the effects of climate change! I guess the lesson is you’re damned if you do, and you’re damned if you don’t. A cautionary tale of extreme forms of geoengineering. Waterworld A classic from the 90’s when Kevin Costner was the biggest star on the planet and could do no wrong. In this movie, the polar ice caps have melted covering the world in water and Kevin Costner plays a man with gills and webbed feet over 20 years before The Shape of Water! It’s an enjoyable action-adventure movie typical of the era and at the time was the most expensive movie ever made. At the beginning of the movie, Kevin Costner recycles and drinks his pee. Let’s just hope we don’t have to resort to that kind of stuff anytime soon. Snowpiercer If there’s one movie to watch on this list, it’s this one. Another classic from Korean director Bong Joon-Ho, it’s adapted from the French graphic novel La Transperceneige. The world has frozen over after an attempt at climate engineering and the last of humanity lives on a train that never stops. The poor are at the back of the train and the elites are in the front. It’s brilliant and brutal stuff. And the immortal Tilda Swinton’s in it. The American President This is a bit of a cheat since the movie isn’t really about climate change at all but more of a romantic comedy involving the President of the United States (not the current one). Many of you might not know, but in the mid-nineties, climate change (previously known as global warming) was also an issue that needed to be addressed. Not much has changed since then but in a rousing speech towards the end of this movie, President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) puts forward legislation that will cut fossil fuel emissions by 20% demonstrating that in the alternate universe of a movie made over 20 years ago, things are going well.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiration-on-Film-The-Best-Documentaries-for-Social-Entrepreneurs-BLOG-COVER-600x400.png","August 3, 2018","en",0.997233152389526,0.0698303282260895,0.182605937123299,0.147854596376419,0.599709093570709

But have you ever considered taking a different kind of bath? That’s right, you guessed it: I’m talking about forest bathing. In case you haven’t heard of it, forest bathing (or Waldbaden in German) is the practice of immersing yourself in a forest. You gently walk through the trees with no real agenda other than just taking it all in. These days there is even some science to back up its relaxing effects on your mind and body. In a city that has tons of city hiking trails (Stadtwanderwege), it’s easy to get caught up in the act of getting from A to B. While that’s also enjoyable, on a scorching hot day you’d inevitably end up drenched in sweat in a mere matter of minutes. So you might instead prefer a slower, less athletic pace. That’s where forest bathing comes in. If you’re still not convinced, just remember: in a forest there are trees. And where there are trees, there is shade. Let’s take a look at some of the delightfully shady forest bathing spots around Vienna. Here are our picks for the top 5 places for forest bathing in Vienna. Wienerwald You’ve probably heard of it — the Vienna Woods, better known as the Wienerwald, is the perfect spot for a nice, refreshing forest bath. You can walk around the woods for a while, calmly absorbing your natural surroundings. Once you get bored, you can enjoy some lunch or dinner here, head to one of the local museums, or do a different kind of bathing at the thermal baths. The Wienerwald is a pretty big place, so more specifically check out the hillsides of Kahlenberg, where forest bathers might stumble upon old castles, gorgeous views, and precious plants. Semmering A visit to Semmering makes for the perfect day trip from Vienna, especially when you’re in search of greener (aka slightly less hot) pastures. There are tons of different activities to do here, including hiking, biking, and, of course, forest bathing! If you want to get up into the mountains with as little effort (and sweat) as possible, try taking the ski lift up, then just enjoy the Alpine beauty up above. The Lobau If you’re looking for something with more of an exotic jungle vibe, the Lobau is your place. Sometimes referred to as the “water forest” and situated in the Donau-Auen National Park, the Lobau is a great place to go if you want to get a more literal form of bathing. You can even swim in some of the water you see along the way! As a wetland, the Lobau is a unique ecosystem containing tons of different flora and fauna. Listening to the sounds of the water forest makes for the perfect forest bathing experience. Forest Bathing in Graz If you want to get super legit, you can do some “real” forest bathing in Graz. Although it’s not technically in Vienna, it could be worth the trip for the aspiring expert forest bather. Waldwelt offers workshops in forest bathing as well as some other relaxing and foresty activities. Wien Weinwandertag Okay, this admittedly has nothing to do with forest bathing, but it’s imperative that you know about it. Sometimes all you can do to forget about the heat is to drink wine with your friends. What better way to do it than while enjoying the hillsides of the Viennese wine country? Although it will (hopefully) have cooled off by the end of September, if you’re like me, then you’ll still be recovering from the misery of the current heat wave. That’s why you need to know about the Wiener Weinwandertag (in English it’s called the Vienna Wine Hiking Day, but it sounds cooler in German). You get to wander around the hills and vineyards of Vienna, stopping for wine as you go. This year it’s happening on September 29th and 30th, so mark it on your calendar — maybe I’ll see you there.

Many politicians use this issue for their own political purposes and are likely not as knowledgeable about the subject as they might claim to be. So don’t be swayed by popular opinion or by what some people say, go find the information yourself and be informed. Podcasts are great for this. The long form of a podcast allows you to dive deep into a subject. If you’re still itching for more content about migration and social inclusion after making your way through our must-see documentaries list, here are our picks for 5 great podcasts about migration and social inclusion. BBC – The Documentary Podcast The BBC World Service are producing a fantastic podcast series about a variety of subjects. If you go into their archives from 2015, you’ll find their series The Year of Migration, which has a series of episodes about the migration issue from all sides. Migration Nation While everyone is trying to project and look forward to see how migration will impact the world, Migration Nation looks back and documents the history of migration in the United States of America. Discover how bourbon whiskey was invented, the impact of enslaved migration, and how the Yankees settled the Midwest. Freakonomics: Is Migration a Basic Human Right? Pretty much everyone knows this podcast given its consistent ranking at the top of the charts. It’s fun and informative and shines a light on a variety of different topics within the broad subject of economics. One of their episodes from 2015 was about migration and it’s a sobering exploration into the topic asking the question we should all be asking ourselves: is migration a basic human right? Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies If you want to go deep into the weeds on this subject, check out the podcast from the Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies of the SOAS University of London. Experts and academics give lectures on their area of expertise ranging from cross-cultural migration in Eurasia since the 1500’s to integration of migrants in the United Kingdom. Small Changes – The Guardian This podcast focuses on the topic of global development and is a series of one-on-one interviews with people who see problems in the world and then go out and solve them. The topics of migration, sex education, disease, women’s rights are all explored. The issues might be vast and complex, but if this podcast teaches us anything, a small change is better than no change.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Image-2018-03-13-at-7.43-AM-600x400.jpg","August 24, 2018","en",0.995638787746429,0.244800359010696,0.119074046611786,0.0046532666310668,0.631472408771515
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/08/31/get-back-swing-things/","ImpactHub","How to get back into the swing of things","Summer is coming to a close sooner than many of us hoped, but that doesn’t mean September has to be depressing. It can be tricky to snap out of the delightful vacation mode and get back into work mode, but I’m confident you can do it. Take a look at a few of these tips to help you along the way. Think of it as a new year You know that fresh feeling of possibility at the start of a new year? Maybe it’s from a new year’s resolution, or maybe it just feels like you get to reset and have a fresh start. It’s really just all in our heads though, isn’t it? Try replicating this feeling at the start of September, as if it were January 1st! Think about the goals you want to accomplish and all the possibilities that lie ahead. This could help you hit the ground running rather than dragging your feet when you’re trying to get back into the swing of things. Reconnect with colleagues The Austrian workplace has one guarantee over the summer: someone is bound to be on vacation at any given time. While vacation is awesome, it’s also nice when everyone is around at the same time. Look at the start of autumn as an opportunity to reconnect with your colleagues. Chances are they’re also feeling the Summer’s End Blues, so they will probably appreciate a chat. If nothing else, you could go for a drink after work and commiserate together about the pain of being a working adult. Misery loves company! Treat yourself If you can remember back to your childhood days when you were going back to school this time of year, you might recall a feeling of excitement. While students have their own reasons to be depressed about the end of summer and the start of school, there was always something new and exciting involved: a new class, new friends, new school supplies, new clothes, or whatever it may be. Try to replicate that feeling into adulthood and treat yourself a little bit. Buy yourself a new pair of shoes or a new gym membership, or start a new healthy habit (such as food or exercise). Remember, treating yourself doesn’t have to revolve around consumerism or sugary treats. Try treating your mental and physical wellness with some healthy nutrition and whatever else it is that makes you really feel good. You deserve it! Allow yourself to catch up Don’t set the bar too high when you’re just coming off vacation. If you aim to suddenly be the most productive you’ve ever been, you’re bound to feel disappointed. Instead, cut yourself some slack and take it step-by-step. Don’t be surprised if it takes a few days to really get back into work mode. Better yet, consciously set time aside to answer emails you missed and organize your schedule. You’ll be back to it in no time!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/09/04/the-basics-of-sustainable-production/","ImpactHub","The Basics of Sustainable Production","It is fundamentally distressing to think we cannot stop being consumers. We need to eat, to use energy to heat our homes, and even passively use wires to communicate with friends around the globe. We produce everything in some way, whether farming food, generating energy by massive steam turbines, or extruding metal into wires. All of this has an impact on the environment and people. Whether it is through farm labour, the fuel used to power the turbine, or the chemicals used in the extrusion processes. Sustainable production is one of the options to reduce our impact, environmental and human, as individuals and as society. Can the famer hire fair seasonal labour? Can we use wind to power the turbine instead of fossil fuels? Can we find a more environmentally friendly to refine metals? Consumers most often hear about sustainable products with respect to farming practices and food production. Sustainable production is more than farming without pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Sustainability crosses all industrial sectors. It affects all consumer goods and services. The Basics The basics of sustainable production are simple, according to The University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, “sustainable production is the creation of goods and services using processes and systems that are non-polluting, conserving of energy and natural resources, economically viable, safe and healthful for workers, communities, and consumers, and socially and creatively rewarding for all working people.” The Lowell Center states one of the conditions for sustainable production is valuing “longer-term consequences and benefits over short-term profits.” This means placing higher value on healthy workers, communities, and ecosystems far into the future over immediate growth strategies. For larger, established organizations this means changing long-standing processes and suppliers. The Lowell Center suggests “investing in well-designed safer products, resource efficient technologies and processes, and trained and empowered employees.” The advice is applicable for new ventures and start-ups. New companies have the advantage of being able to create sustainable processes, policies, and practices from the very beginning. The Benefits of Sustainable Practices Large- and small-scale producers benefit from adopting new and sustainable operating procedures. The World Economic Forum states “sustainability drives purpose and passion for employees.” People “want to feel great about what they do every day,” according to the World Economic Forum. This means consumers and producers. Whether it is eating apples or farming them, we all want to feel good about ourselves, our jobs, and our impact. This borne out by research into employee engagement within the Human Resources sector. Daniel Pink, in his book Drive, states employees need to be connected to the purpose of an organization. They need to feel part of more than posted profits, financial growth, and revenue streams. Corporate social responsibility programs, sustainable production practices, and collective impact projects all help to bolster employee engagement. The World Economic Forumreports many companies who post high revenues while adopting more sustainable business practices, “take Whole Foods, for example. This is one of nine companies in the sustainability space with revenues worth more than $1 billion, alongside eco-friendly innovators such as Tesla, Chipotle and Natura.” “Not only are companies making money, but they are growing their market share by being sustainable,” according to the World Economic Forum. Unilever has an impressive track record, its “16 ‘Sustainable Living’ brands are becoming increasingly important to the company, growing more than 50% faster than the rest of the business and accounting for 60% of growth in 2016,” according to the same report. The employee engagement, increased profit, and increased market share are impressive lures for any company looking to convert to more sustainable options. For consumers, the benefits are numerous. Often one-time expenditures mean less money spent over time, an example is disposable diapers versus cloth diapers. While the upfront cost for several sets of disposable diapers is more than a box of disposable diapers, consumers spend the money a few times throughout the infant and toddler years. Repairs often cost less than purchasing a new item. Sometimes, they free and consumers learn new skills in the process by accessing local repair cafes. Which means more money saved in the pocket of the consumers. Market Trends The University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership published their report on trends which will affect the industry over the next several years. The report lists eight key trends, “volatility is the new normal, sustainability to shape the face of business, extreme loss and damage from extreme weather, human versus machine, China and the global shift to the East, the end of an era for plastic, a watershed year for transparency, life after coal.” Our Ventures are Leading the Charge At Impact Hub Vienna our ventures are at the forefront of the sustainability movement. Iss Mich is a sustainable caterer offering you a wide variety of event options made with food which would otherwise be thrown out. Food which simply does not meet the narrow definition of consumable. Which means it has to meet a specific standard, like carrots have to be perfectly straight. However, Iss Mich takes this produce and makes delicious food for your events. Erdbeerwoche’s mission is twofold; provide girls and women with education about their periods and to provide consumers with sustainable options for their periods. Products made from organic cotton or reusable goods can be purchased. Their products are good for the environment and consumers’ pocket books.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/09/06/sustainable-spotlight-an-interview-with-alpengummi/","ImpactHub","Sustainable Spotlight: An Interview with Alpengummi"," We connected with the producers of Alpengummi, Sandra and Claudia, to chat about their new sustainable chewing gum venture. It was a great conversation concerning the sustainability of ingredients and traditional industries. Check out their thoughts on the viability of healthful ingredients in chewing gum in this thought-provoking interview. What made you start Alpengummi? We met during our first year of our environmental sciences master’s program in Copenhagen. In the second year at BOKU in Vienna, we had a course together about innovations in the forestry sector. We were encouraged to write a plan for a fictional business idea. We started to investigate what kind of innovation could possibly be done in a forest – and we came across the tree resin. We found out that resin is chewable and that people were already chewing it thousands of years ago. In the Austrian countryside, people still know all about it – it’s called Kaupech. We also came across the old process, Pecherei, which is a way of extracting resin from pine trees in lower Austria. This art has become part of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2011. Once it was an important and booming industry. Eventually it was substituted for fossil fuels and cheaper imports. Pecherei once shaped the landscape, culture and economy of this region and formed the livelihood of thousands of families, has shrunk to only a handful of active resin extractors, Pecher, and one of the last independent resin extraction companies in Central Europe. We started to wonder how conventional chewing gums are made. We realized the producers do not declare the ingredients of their “gum base”. When we looked for more information we realized big companies refuse to these types of questions. As a result, we assumed these are most probably made of synthetic polymers, similar to those used for car tyres and rubber gloves, which only adds to the list of synthetic and harmful ingredients in chewing gum. Sandra and Claudia in the lab (c) Ignacio RodriguezHow did you come up with the name Alpengummi? We grew up in the Alps. From the heart of the Alps to the foothills, where the pine forests can be found. It just came naturally to us that the first natural chewing gum of the Alps should be called Alps’ gum, Alpengummi. We did not have to think about it at all, the name was just there – even before we started to make it. Why is your product important for today? What makes it sustainable? What’s the value proposition? When we look at the chewing gum sector, we see that there are still only a handful of natural alternatives – most of these use Chicle for their gum base, the tree sap of the Mexican Sapotille tree that grows in the rainforests. This is great, but it’s not economically viable for Europe to import from Mexico if we have local trees that make a great gum base. Our entire Alpengummi is made of natural ingredients like pine resin, bees wax, birch sugar and natural flavours. We use birch sugar, which does not cause cavities. Sustainability is part of every aspect of our company – from our suppliers, transport and production to our product packaging which is created as naturally as possible in the food sector. Our chewing gum is also bio-degradable and does not contribute to the global waste problem. What are the environmental benefits of switching to Alpengummi? By chewing Alpengummi, you support renewable resources like the tree resin. Pine trees are harvested over decades. As both the pine resin and the birch sugar are obtained from trees, you support forests that form a valuable ecosystem for endangered species and play an important role in the carbon sequestration of the planet. We use bees wax from small beekeepers that let their bees fly on orchard meadows for our gum base. What are the values of Alpengummi? Besides being a sustainable business, we want to be fully transparent. This means we list all the ingredients we use and tell the stories of the people and places where we source the raw products. We want that people know what they are chewing. We wanted to get back to our roots. We want to show sometimes the solution lies in the old and traditional. Resin was chewed in Austria by people in the countryside and it was in the very first chewing gum made in the USA. In looking for solutions in older processes we are also supporting the dying arts of Pecherie and beekeeping. Have there been any challenges you’ve had to overcome to get to where you are now? The first challenge was to create a chewing gum. We knew that resin can be chewed, but it was a big challenge to create a gum base from the resin that was actually chewable and delicious. The biggest challenge we face is the market is dominated by big companies. More than 94% of the worldwide chewing gum market is dominated by one multinational company. We have been in contact with several people who are willing to help us establish our product in this market. One of our biggest supports is AWS (Austria Wirtschaftsservice), who have helped with funding to get us started on our way. We don’t feel like we are facing this challenge alone. What are some of the milestones you’d like to achieve in the next year? The biggest milestone is to get the prototype done and ready. We are still working on the design and packaging. In 2019, we want to start to sell our chewing gum. There are many steps to take before we get to sales, like a detailed distribution plan. What impact would you like to see Alpengummi have? We hope Pecherei will get more attention and support. Hopefully, the resin will be used for more products and more people will work in the industry. We want people to know what they are chewing. To that end, big companies will have to declare what they use for their gum base. We hope it will become common to have natural chewing gum. How can members of Impact Hub help? As we are entering the world of funding and investors, it would also be great to get advice from people who have gone through this before.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/10/23/living-off-grid-using-clean-energy/","ImpactHub","Living off grid using clean energy"," We’ve all dreamed of being free from the rules and requirements of modern day infrastructure. What if you don’t want to be connected to the public power grid? In many places, you are legally required to be connected to the local infrastructure which isn’t an unreasonable request. But if you’ve ever been frustrated by an electric or gas bill, you’ve likely dreamed of taking your energy generating needs into your own hands. Being off grid is a fairly broad term that encompasses many things. It could mean being completely disconnected from anything: you generate all your electricity, sewage, food, and heating needs yourself. But it also means using clean energy solutions to power your own home whether you’re connected to a local electrical grid or not. So if you want to generate your own power, what are your options? Solar The most well-known and accessible option is putting solar panels on the roof of your home. Nowadays it’s pretty straightforward and you can also use solar trackers for added energy generating efficiency to get that extra bit of sun. With solar trackers, your panels move along with the sun to ensure maximum exposure. Every year, there are new technological breakthroughs as solar cells become more efficient and costs drop. They’ve even figured out how to make solar panels nearly invisible if you’ve got a problem with how it looks. Wind energy Wind energy is energy generated by the flow of air. You’ve probably seen the giant wind turbines dotting the landscape in various parts of the world. While it might seem that buying wind energy is your only solution, there are small-scale wind power setups available if it is appropriate for where you live. Micro hydro Micro hydro is a type of hydroelectric power. Unlike hydroeletric power which uses large infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs and can harm the local ecosystem, micro hydro power is all about keeping it on a small scale by using a minimal and natural flow of water. The power generated from micro hydro installations produce anywhere from 5 kW to 100 kW. To give you an idea of how much that is, a 100 kW can power a home or a small business. These kinds of systems often complement solar systems making up for the shortfall of sun during the winter. Geothermal Geothermal energy is using thermal energy from the Earth to make power. While it’s possible that there is enough geothermal energy to power the entire world, the energy isn’t available everywhere and exploiting hard to access geothermal energy is cost prohibitive. Smaller scale geothermal power plants are increasing in popularity but these are still industrial level solutions. If you’re looking for a geothermal solution for your home, check out a geothermal heat pump which transfers heat to or from the ground to manage your home heating and cooling needs. Upfront costs are high but with subsidies and the amount of money you’ll be saving on your heating and cooling bill, the system should pay itself back in a few years. So what if you can’t put solar panels on your home or set up a wind turbine or generate your own micro hydro or geothermal energy? Switch to an energy provider that provides clean energy. Go out there and do your research. There are energy providers who produce clean and renewable energy. So even if you you might not be able to generate your own clean energy any time soon and be completely off grid, at least you can support the energy you would like to generate.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clean-energy-off-grid-banner-600x400.jpg","October 23, 2018","en",0.996813595294952,0.305373519659042,0.499529451131821,0.105319477617741,0.0897775813937187

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/11/19/smart-cities-best-practices-around-globe/","ImpactHub","Smart Cities: Best practices from around the globe"," A smart city is a city which uses data and technology to more efficiently manage assets and resources. This can be a city’s water supply, electrical grid, waste management system or all of the above. Economists estimate that smart cities could save 22 trillion dollars by 2050. With such a wide-ranging definition and with another city going smart every day, it’s easy to get a bit lost in the whole idea of a smart city since all of them are doing different things. Every city has its own unique challenges and being smart is just about finding innovative ways to solve them. Some smart cities are built from the ground up while others are trying to do their best with what they’ve got. Songdo, South Korea If we’re going to talk about smart cities, we’ve got to talk about the world’s first: Songdo, South Korea. Built on reclaimed land from the Yellow Sea, it is the largest private real estate development in the history of the world projected to cost $40 billion. With plenty of LEED certified office spaces, elevators which go to the ground floor the second you enter the building, and trash being taken and sorted using pneumatic tubes from your apartment, it’s designed to be the business and residential city of the future. Sensors all over the city continually monitor and optimize road traffic, electricity, and the flow of water. San Francisco, USA It shouldn’t be a surprise that one of the most expensive places to live in the world has also been on the forefront of implementing smart technology in the city’s infrastructure. Approximately 40% of the city’s electricity comes from renewable energy and the city has recently expanded its demand-responsive pricing policy for parking. Prices for parking spaces dynamically increase or decrease based on demand. The results of the pilot phase concluded that average parking rates were lower, parking availability increased, and greenhouse gas emissions decreased because people no longer had to circle endlessly to find parking. Trikala, Greece Referred to as Greece’s first smart city, Trikala has only 82,000 residents but all its services are connected. In the city’s control room, a worker can see the status of traffic lights, water pipes, available parking, and even the locations of each and every garbage truck. The city’s e-complaint system allows citizens to submit a request for services either online or through an app. Problems are now solved in eight days on average. This might still sound like a long time until you think about how it took a month to solve any issue before the city went smart. If that weren’t enough, there’s also self-driving buses, more efficient streetlights, and even a Raspberry Pi kit for every public school in the city. Estonia All of Estonia. Not just the capital Tallinn but the whole country where 99% of public services are available online all day every day. The only things you have to leave your house for are to get married, get divorced, or buy real estate. Everything else can be managed online. You can found a company in approximately 18 minutes. Estonians can even vote online and they’ve been doing it since 2005. Online voting has been estimated to save 11,000 working days per election. These are just a few of many smart cities and smart countries around the world. For fellow Impact Hub Vienna members, don’t forget that the city of Vienna is also a smart city with various projects tackling challenges in sectors such as energy, health, transportation, buildings, and the environment.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-19-at-12.41.11-PM-600x400.png","November 19, 2018","en",0.99173641204834,0.0347238332033157,0.543791234493256,0.0504642575979233,0.37102073431015
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/11/27/fundraise-wisr/","ImpactHub","How to fundraise WisR","Raising money is a must for any new company looking to spread its wings and it’s one of the bigger challenges a startup will face. You need to prepare the right documentation, meet investor after investor, and that’s if you’re lucky enough to even get a meeting. Fundraising can take up to six months and go on even longer. By that time, many entrepreneurs just want to get it over with. But even if the process is arduous, for those who’ve jumped at the first sign of interest and Euros, it was something they soon regretted. Once an investor jumps on board, it becomes a relationship. They might be aligned with your interests or they might not. This is something you need to figure out before you accept any money. If you don’t, you might find yourself spending your days babysitting your new investor instead of building and expanding your business. Earlier this year, one of Impact Hub Vienna’s program members. WisR, successfully raised a seed round of 250,000 euros in just two months! Carina Roth, Co-Founder and CFO gave a talk on all the ins and outs of what they did to get the terms they wanted and the amount they needed in the time they wanted to spend doing it. Here are 8 key takeaways on how you could do the same. Talk to your peers! Find the companies who’ve successfully raised funds and chat with them over coffee, lunch, or whatever. If possible, find companies who are similar to yours to find out how they did it and what they would do differently. They’ve already gone through the process and have learned tons while doing so. Many are happy to share what they know. Prepare, prepare, and then prepare some more Everything you do now, you won’t have to do later. Show your potential investors that you know what you’re talking about by having all documentation ready to go. This includes all the standard issue things like slide deck, executive summary, cash flow projections, profit and loss statements, and depending on what stage your company is in, the assumptions you made to get to those numbers. This even includes contacting your lawyer and preparing the term sheet. This isn’t to say that the terms are already set in stone, but by preparing well in advance, it forces you to think about these things so when you’re the face-to-face with an investor, you’re prepared for all questions and know what you’re talking about. Contact everyone at the same time but start collecting names months in advance Don’t wait for one investor to bow out before you talk to another. Start collecting names as soon as you can and if possible, reach out and contact them even before you’re thinking about raising money just to keep them in the loop about what’s going on. Send an update with every milestone you hit. When the time comes to raise money, they’ll already know who you are and what you’re about. Keep your e-mail short and simple but with all the necessary information. You will be contacting lots of people and you don’t want to spend the next month constantly answering questions. Be transparent You shouldn’t have anything to hide so don’t hide anything. Show them who you are, what you do, and what you want to do. If they like it, great! If they don’t, then it’s not a match. Be upfront with your terms and the ticket size of each investment. Tell them what kind of investor you’re looking for. Don’t hide things to accommodate the wrong investor. Be transparent to find the right one. Think about the next round Your focus is obviously going to be on raising money right now but when doing so, there are things to consider for the next time. The choices you make now could affect your ability to raise more money later so it’s important to think ahead. For example, set appropriate ticket sizes. Lots of investors with small investments doesn’t look good on the capitalization table so set appropriate ticket sizes. Also, make it a prerequisite to participate in a subsequent round because if you get to the next round and everyone from your previous round bails, that also doesn’t look good. You want long-term investors who believe in your business, not short-term ones who are only looking to make money. Ask, ask, ask! Ask your potential investor questions. Is it their first investment? What companies have they invested in before? How would they feel if things didn’t go according to plan? If they have good answers to these questions, go even further and do your due diligence on them. Call and talk to the companies they’ve invested in and ask about their relationship. How many times do they want to meet? How do they behave? Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you commit to an investor. Credit: Timar Ivo BatisSet a deadline If not, investors think they have all the time in the world to make a decision. A deadline allows them to focus their attention and even motivates them to share the information with other potential investors. Everything moves faster when there’s a deadline and it can create a demand which is what you want. You want to be able to choose from a bunch of potential investors, not just one. Confidentiality agreements Depending on your business, they might not be necessary. It might be obvious, but don’t hand over all your confidential documents during the 1st meeting. Trust your gut. If you meet an investor and don’t trust them, there’s no need for a confidentiality agreement because you shouldn’t be showing them your confidential internal documents anyway. These 8 key takeaways are just some of the main points covered in the talk. Check out the whole video for even more detail on the actual terms of WisR’s seed round financing.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/12/19/deep-impact-measurement-impact-society/","ImpactHub","Deep impact: A guide to impact measurement"," Impact measurement remains a big challenge for social businesses across the world because it’s just not as straightforward as dollars and cents. To truly capture impact, a social venture might need a larger allocation of time and resources. It’s important to get acquainted with some of the standard metrics and data points of impact measurement. Measuring lasting impact usually requires a long-term study but there’s plenty of information to communicate to stakeholders prior to that. Ultimately it’s the mix between data points and longer-term studies which paint the full picture of social impact. The Framework There’s no one impact measurement framework but the most common one involves an assessment of a business’ inputs (the resources available), outputs (the activities and services of a business), outcome (the change created), and impact (the long-term effects). Unfortunately, impact is the area which requires the most amount of resources to measure so if a company is short on resources, it’s best to focus on outputs and outcomes as these can be more quickly measured and communicated. If you need help in deciding what metrics are appropriate for your project that adhere to industry standards, check out Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS). IRIS IRIS is an initiative of the Global Impact Investing Network’s (GIIN), a non-profit dedicated to increasing the effectiveness of impact investments. Some of its most prominent members are: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefellar Foundation, and The MacArthur Foundation. IRIS is the go-to catalog for impact performance metrics so that impact investors can measure the social, financial, and environmental performance of initiatives. IRIS metrics are available for free. If you’re just starting out and want to incorporate some impact measurement metrics from the get-go, this is a good place to start to find the metrics that best describe your project. Global Impact Investment Ratings System (GIIRS) B Lab’s GIIRS system is more investor focused. While the reports include data points and analytics about a venture’s social impact, the goal of these metrics and data points are to create a standardized way for impact investors to compare the performances of various companies and funds. GIIRS is driven by IRIS and its ratings methodology is overseen by an independent Standards Advisory Council and subject to a rigorous audit process. Depending on the project, impact isn’t always so black and white. It takes time for certain projects to truly demonstrate their impact and this should be communicated to all stakeholders. If longer term studies are needed, allocate the appropriate resources or find partners to help. In the end, capturing and communicating the impact you’ve created might be just as important as the impact itself.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tape-600x400.jpg","December 19, 2018","en",0.992094755172729,0.0989183485507965,0.776900887489319,0.0165281649678946,0.107652619481087

Getting your head in the game after the festive season can be difficult with office Christmas parties, punsch at markets, and the general winding down of office activities through the month of December. We have some great tips, pulled from all over the internet, to help you readjust to office life after the festive season is over. Tidy Up Before You Go According to LifeHack, a great way to get back into the swing of things at the office is to tidy up before you go. Coming back to a messy desk can cause stress. Creating a clean and well-ordered workspace will make catching up easier when you arrive back in the office. Marie Kondo, the tidiness maven responsible for the book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying, says once you tidy up you “have the energy and motivation to create the life you want”. It is just a simple thing which could save you so much time and effort when you return from all the festivities. Make Lists Some of us are compulsive list makers. Some of us love the sight of a fully crossed off to-do list. Making a list of all your unfinished projects and where you are at in each of them will help you pick up the threads when you sit back in your office chair. People will have sent emails and called while you are at your Grandmother’s Silvester Party, going through your emails and phone messages and making a prioritized list when you return will help with some of the stress associated with getting back to the office according to LifeHack. One Thing at a Time Psychology Today reports that we are not as great at multi-tasking as we think. According to their article, The Myth of Multitasking, we lose precious seconds every time we switch from task to task, even it is listening to music while answering emails. According to their article you stop one task and move on to the next, even if it is only a ten second music clip and a single line email, we still need to stop and pick up again. This can cause stress, minute amounts but stress all the same. As LifeHack says “why stress yourself out if you can avoid it?” Leave the Office That’s right, we said it. And we said it for two reasons. The first, is to get you out of the office on time and the second is to get you to take a walk during the day. Work-life balance in the start-up ecosystem is hard enough to achieve but when you are coming back from vacation it can be harder. Set yourself a time limit and make sure you leave at that time. Making sure you have time to devote to family and yourself is essential to maintaining a healthy balance. Have we spoken lately about the benefits of walking? Trust us, they are myriad. According to Reader’s Digest, it can boost your mood, improve your creativity, help you remove that Christmas weight, sleep better, and reduce stress. Need more tips, check out our other guide on getting back in the office after the holidays.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/getting-600x400.jpg","December 20, 2018","en",0.995894193649292,0.00762032438069582,0.116784729063511,0.00239982130005956,0.873195111751556
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/01/15/creating-collaborative-spaces-interview-daniel-utrilla/","ImpactHub","Creating Collaborative Spaces: An interview with Daniel Utrilla Mellinas"," Collaborative spaces are one of the most important aspects of modern work and they don’t just come out of nowhere. A lot of thought, planning, and design work goes into the desk you don’t even think twice to sit down at. Daniel Utrilla Mellinas is the Space Manager at Impact Hub Vienna. A designer through and through with a background in engineering, Daniel took the time to sit down and talk about how he approaches space design, how he ended up at Impact Hub Vienna, and what’s in the store for the future. What brought you to Impact Hub Vienna? Facebook. I saw an ad on Facebook that they were looking for a host. This was a little over 3 years ago. I initially came to Vienna on a grant to learn German. When I was finished, I was ready to head back to Spain. But then I found the Hub and it was exactly what I was looking for– a place where I fit in terms of creativity, innovation, and design in general. After a few months I was part of the Space and Infrastructure Circle. A few months later, I was Floor Manager and Space Curator, and about a year after that, I became Space Manager. What’s your creative process? How do you begin to see the possibilities of a space? Before I design anything, the most important thing I have to understand are the needs. I can’t design anything until I know what those needs are. Sometimes there’s a really good briefing but if not, I’ll conduct interviews and do research because I need to understand the problem to be solved. Once I’ve got that, I start brainstorming, sketching, and prototyping in order to come up with ideas to fulfill the needs that I’ve identified and then I’ll iterate until I get it right. Sometimes I’ll get to prototyping on a 1:1 scale. When it’s a space, I like to walk around and see what my ideas might look like in the actual space with wood, paper, or cardboard. Sometimes I realize it’s not working and go back to 1:100 scale and start again. Why do you think collaborative spaces are important? I think it’s important now and it’s become more important in the last few years because the way we work has evolved towards more collaboration. Obviously, it depends on what you do but generally, work requires more collaboration and if a space isn’t set up that way, it’s not a surprise if productivity or efficiency is low. Nowadays, it’s pretty common in a project for a variety of departments or circles to be involved such as social media, marketing, design, engineering; there’s so many inputs that are necessary. How do you create the opportunity or facilitate collaboration in a space? There’s no one rule so it depends on the organization and the requirements of the organization. It’s not just taking down walls and making everything open plan. If that’s not appropriate for a company, then it won’t work and you have to explore other options to enable collaboration in a space. It could be making a coffee area in the center of the building so everyone goes there to start conversations. You could put innovation cores in different areas so people connect there. But like I said, there’s no golden rule. You need to analyze the way people cooperate and collaborate. If collaborations are primarily online, the solutions may be different than if collaborations are mostly in person. What’s the most important element in creating a collaborative space? I think collaboration is really connected with emotions. I want to work with someone because I trust them. Creating this trust is very important and one of the most common things to start this process is coffee. Coffee connects people and having an area where people go to take a break allows people to have conversations which leads to connections and collaboration. Standing tables are also very interesting because it’s been shown that people feel more secure when they are talking while standing up. When you are sitting behind something or sitting down, you’re not as open as you are when you’re standing up. But ultimately, the most important element is to understand how a particular organization or space collaborates and go from there. What’s up next for the Impact Hub Vienna Space? How have the recent renovations affected collaboration? We have 3 floors now and we’ve noticed they’ve been operating independently and we’d like to change that. We want to create more connections between the floors and one thing we’ll be doing is having more co-working space on the 3rd floor. Other things we’re looking into is creating signs and objects that link the floors while also representing the Hub so when you look at these things, you know it’s Impact Hub. We’d also like to try and get people to move around between floors so if there’s an event, it’s on the Ground Floor. If it’s chatting and coffee, 1st Floor, or if you need a Silent Area, it’s on the 3rd Floor. We’ll try these things to see if they work. If not, we’ll iterate and try again.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-22-at-5.30.50-PM-600x400.png","January 15, 2019","en",0.991221964359283,0.000625159940682352,0.704485833644867,0.00648418042692356,0.288404829800129
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/01/22/sustainable-development-goals/","ImpactHub","Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 101"," SDGs stand for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted in 2015 and are key to the world achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity. The SDGs build on the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and address issues that need to be solved, such as poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), or improved, such as education (SDG4). It’s a call to action for every single country on the planet to focus their work on the goals which will make the world a better place. All told, there are 17 SDGs and each of them have many targets to achieve by 2030 at the latest. This sounds like a lot, but that just means there’s a lot of work to do. Every SDG comes with its own facts, figures, and targets so we’ve decided to pick out the most important things for each SDG to give you a broad overview. 1. No Poverty End Poverty in all its forms everywhere. It’s the 1st because it’s the most important. While poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, there are still around 783 million people who live under the international poverty line of US $1.90 a day. 2. Zero Hunger 1 in 9 people in the world (815 million people) are undernourished. Most live in developing countries. Poor nutrition causes almost half of all deaths of children under the age of 5. So how do we go about tackling this? We need to reevaluate how we grow, distribute, and consume food. 3. Good Health and Well-Being Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. One of the main goals of this SDG is to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. Another is to reduce premature deaths caused by incommunicable diseases by 1/3. This goal spans the fields of healthcare, hygiene and sanitation, and education. 4. Quality Education Over 265 million children are currently out of school. 22% are primary school age. So one of the main goals of SDG4 is to ensure that all children receive free quality primary and secondary education. 5. Gender Equality Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. While progress has been made in recent years, women and girls still suffer from discrimination and violence in every part of the world. Main targets are ending discrimination and violence against women, ensuring equal opportunities in political, economic, and public life, and the recognition of unpaid domestic work. 6. Clean Water and Sanitation Ensure access to water and sanitation for all. 3 in 10 people in the world lack access to safely managed drinking water and 6 in 10 people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. While solving these issues are a must, another target focuses on water-use efficiency across all sectors which is critical to this SDG. 7. Affordable and Clean Energy Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. 13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity. The goal is to get them onto the grid in an affordable, responsible, and sustainable way while giving everyone access to clean energy. 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. While the global unemployment rate has gone down, it’s not ensuring a path out of poverty for people in many places. Decent work opportunities continue to be lacking. The goal is to get people quality jobs that stimulate the economy in an environmentally friendly way. 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. The goal is to grow productivity and incomes which in turn will improve health and education. But, none of it is possible without good infrastructure in sectors such as transportation, communications, irrigation, and energy. 10. Reduced Inequalities Reduce inequality within countries and between countries. As much as there’s been a particular focus on economic growth in other SDGs, it’s not enough to reduce poverty if all the wealth goes to a few people. So the main goal is to grow the incomes of the bottom 40% at a rate that’s higher than the national average. 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Everyone is moving to a city and it’s projected 5 billion people will be living in a city by 2030 with most of the urban expansion happening in developing countries. With so many people piling into such small areas, this creates problems such as congestion, lots of waste, housing shortages, and pollution. Rapid urbanization is happening as we speak and it’ll require a lot of work to ensure that it’s done right while allowing cities to continue to thrive. 12. Responsible Consumption and Production Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. While many of the other SDGs might seem to be outside your sphere of influence, this SDG is something that you can tackle yourself. If you’re not a producer, you’re definitely a consumer because we all are. Start by reducing food waste and sorting your trash. 13. Climate Action Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It’s all about climate change and the goal is to get all countries to implement and act on climate change policies. 14. Life Below Water Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The oceans are being destroyed so the goal is to reduce pollution, manage and protect marine ecosystems, and end overfishing. Over 3 billion people rely on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihood and as their primary source of protein. 15. Life on Land Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss. We’re also destroying our land so it’s all about conservation, restoration, and the sustainable management and use of land and forests. 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies. Violence, human trafficking, corruption, bribery, tax evasion, and theft affect societies and communities everywhere. Strong institutions are needed to fight against these crimes to build more peaceful and inclusive societies. 17. Partnerships for the Goals Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. We all need to work together if any of this is going to work. This means partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society. We hope this overview was helpful!

In order to successfully grow a business, we need to move faster and with much greater effectiveness. We need access to data that allows our teams to learn, move and improve in real-time. The data needs to provide us with more signal in a sea of continuous noise. The data also needs to motivate and create momentum for those we lead. Where is this mysterious data set? And better yet, how do we integrate it for making decisions? There is something referred to as the heart center of the human can synthesize data and provide feedback to the brain. What is the heart center? According to the HeartMath Institute, the intelligence of the heart allows your body to evolve toward higher levels of order, awareness, and alignment with the other systems of the body, including the brain. “In the new field of neurocardiology, for example, scientists have discovered that the heart possesses its own intrinsic nervous system—a network of nerves so functionally sophisticated as to earn the description of a “heart brain.” Containing over 40,000 neurons, this “little brain” gives the heart the ability to independently sense, process information, make decisions, and even to demonstrate a type of learning and memory. Messages the heart sends to the brain also can affect performance”. – HeartMath Institute We also know “emotions are humanity’s motivator and its omnipresent guide.” – Dr. Thomas Lewis, A General Theory of Love This ‘emotional data’ is difficult to capture so we tend to ignore it or deem it invalid, especially in the workplace. We, at Kokoro, have a hypothesis – emotions drive performance. Emotions are the leading indicator of performance. And, importantly, emotions fuel business success. Let’s take a look at what science, research, and the latest trends have to say about high-performing teams and emotions. Amy Edmonton of Harvard looks at how psychological safety drives team performance This Harvard article reveals how psychological safety and diversity help to drive innovation and creativity The University of Sussex, looks at how identity and belonging to the team increases performance Here is an article on how workplace satisfaction drives productivity And one from Inc.com on how retaining talent is predicated on organizational mood and emotional connectedness High-quality emotions drive performance, so why don’t we use this valuable data to help our teams thrive? Well, they’re messy and difficult to integrate, making them easy to ignore. Most workplaces have very little if any emotional safety for their employees. Meaning people feel they cannot fully express themselves without the fear of consequence. When was the last time you were able to express yourself about the dirty dishes in the sink? Or when your boss told you to do something that didn’t align with your talents? So where do we start to integrate this more ‘emotional data’ that drives our teams? Listening and awareness are the first steps. Here are four easy tactics to start integrating emotions with your teams now: Listen – What wants to be said? What are the collective emotions saying? Surface – Where is the tension in the team? What wants to be surfaced? Process – How do we deal with those emotions? What will help us move forward? Adjust – How do we move and improve? The key is–keep it simple. Find quick and easy ways to build your emotional competence by tackling one thing at a time. I hope this helps you get started unlocking the true potential of your team and understanding how emotions fuel business success!

We’ve used the latest scientific research and our work with over 1,000 teams to help companies measure what matters.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Blog-HUB-1-600x400.jpg","February 5, 2019","en",0.995257139205933,0.0862285941839218,0.74407684803009,0.0823643878102303,0.087330162525177

In 2018, the Greiner family decided to dedicate funds to giving back to society. To do this, they set up an accelerator program for impact entrepreneurs, and are now building a selective network of impact investors to bridge the gap between start-ups, know-how and funding. Each year the family will define a specific area it wants to focus on, based on the principles of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year the focus is on equal access to quality education and decent employment opportunities, to reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Set up in collaboration with Impact Hub Vienna, the program has now six impact entrepreneurs who have been carefully selected after presenting valid business concepts, and proof that their ideas have a measurable impact. The finalists get the opportunity to take part in a modular series of workshops and training in: Financial Skills Impact Measurement Sales and Marketing Strategy Between November 2018 and April 2019, each of the finalists, in addition, receive online expert and peer-to-peer support while taking part in these modules, ahead of the final pitching day in front of a selected pool of impact investors in Munich on April 11th.

Is it a co-working space? Is it a business accelerator? And why are there so many references to the Sustainable Development Goals hanging on the walls? The essence of Impact Hub and our community can be difficult to capture, as it is so many things. Impact Hub is an inspiring workspace where people come to catalyze new business ideas. It is a community where a serendipitous encounter at the coffee machine can lead to collaboration on a new project. It is a business accelerator where founders can get access to the experts and structured support they need to learn critical skills. But it’s also something a bit more intangible. Together with our member Zimt Film, we recently worked on a project to capture the vision and values of various members in the Impact Hub community. We interviewed the founders of Value App, Basenbox, Fitico, and more to find out about their experiences within the walls of Impact Hub. We also interviewed a few members of the Impact Hub Vienna team to share insights on the various ways Impact Hub connects the startup ecosystem in Vienna. We hope that the collective impressions of these interviews can help shed some light on both the tangible and intangible aspects of what Impact Hub Vienna is all about. Check out our full video and get to know a little more about our community. P.S. When we have to succinctly answer the question–what is Impact Hub? We often respond: Impact Hub Vienna is a diverse community of founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs who have one thing in common–we believe bold, entrepreneurial ideas can change the society for the better. At Impact Hub, people innovate with heart, balancing social responsibility with profitability to build a world that works for all.

March 8th is International Women’s Day, and across the globe we are celebrating the powerful women who are shaking the foundations of once patriarchal systems and societies to build a more gender-balanced world. This year, International Women’s Day is taking place under the banner of a new campaign, #BalanceForBetter, and we’re participating by highlighting a few of the women who inspire us. Some of these ladies are founders from within our own Impact Hub Vienna community, some are women who are internationally renowned for achievements in their field, and some simply have a powerful message we think is worth sharing. Enjoy these inspiring talks and help us celebrate women’s achievement on International Women’s Day (and every other day) by sharing this post with the hashtag #BalanceForBetter. Dr. Brené Brown, The Power of Vulnerability Being stoic is so 20th century. There is power in opening up to others, asking for help, and sharing experiences–both good and bad. Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor who has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and in this Ted Talk she shares what it really means to be brave in this world. Perrine Schober, Turning Weaknesses Into Strengths Perrine Schober is an Impact Hub Vienna member, and founder of SHADES TOURS, an organization that offers tours which shed light on topics like poverty, homelessness, refugees, and integration in Vienna. Her work has inspired people from all over the world to start similar projects in their own cities. In 2017, she gave an inspiring TED talk at TEDxTUWien about social entrepreneurship and what drives her to show up and push forward day in and day out, ignoring external pressures to pursue her own path. Isabel Allende, Tales of Passion Isabel Allende is a Chilean author and activist. She is often referred to as the world’s most widely read Spanish-language author, and many of her books highlight powerful stories in the lives of women. In this TED Talk, she discusses women, creativity, the definition of feminism, and passion. Cecile Richards, The Political Progress Women Have Made and What’s Next Cecile Richards is a U.S. American leader for women’s rights and author of the bestselling book Make Trouble. In this TED Talk, she challenges women to take part in a global political revolution for women’s equality, and gives some suggestions as to how we can make it happen. Karin Fleck, Vienna Textile Lab Karin Fleck is an Impact Hub Vienna program alumni and the Founder of Vienna Textile Lab. She holds a PhD in Chemistry on Organometallics and a Master’s in Analytic Chemistry. In 2018, she gave a talk at TEDxCanggu in Bali, Indonesia about her company which creates organic colors from naturally occurring bacteria in order to provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional synthetic colors. While we’re sure that she gave an amazing TED talk, it seems that the video of it has been lost to the sands of time. So, here’s the next best thing: her pitch at ClimateLaunchpad. We hope you enjoyed this list of inspiring talks by powerful females from across the globe.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/03/26/founder-spotlight-annamaria-tolvaly-bags-with-legs/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Annamaria Tolvaly, Bags with Legs","Annamaria Tolvaly came to Vienna from Romania, so her own life experience has taught her what it is to start life over in a new place. About a year ago, she opened an atelier and a shop Bags with Legs where she produces and sells exclusive bags. Her mission is to integrate women refugees in her project, providing them with income and a sense of belonging. Several months ago, she came to Impact Hub searching for help and advice and became one of the six participants in the found! accelerator program. How did you come up with the idea of making bags? “I believe that everything we do in the present is the accumulation of our past. I grew up in a family where making things with your hands and being creative was very important in order to survive. I grew up in communism, during a dictatorship. We did not have many things, and we had to create them. So what Bags with Legs does, is make amazing things with few resources. This is how this social project started. “It was very difficult at the beginning-I was unemployed, and I had no money. I started to make bags at home and began asking people how I could make it a sustainable business. But I needed to turn it into something more meaningful. I think that the world has a lot of bags – what it needs is change and inspiration. “I thought: «Ok… I see many women refugees who are trying to find their way, and they have this social stigma of being a migrant…» it’s an issue that speaks to me on a very personal level. I thought that maybe I should do something with them and for them. That is how I came up with idea of creating these handmade bags with the stories of women who came from these complicated places-places where they had to take their luggage along with them every day, out into the world to find a new life.” How did you meet your collaborators? Photo credit: Fernanda Nigro“I set up my shop and one day a woman came in and asked if she could help me. That’s how I met Momina, who is from Syria and was my first employee. Momina studied economics in her country and then worked in her family business. Five years ago she had to run away with her family and came to Vienna.” Momina recounted her story of meeting Annamaria, “Once I was walking near and I heard music coming from the shop and asked: Do you need some help? I told her about my experience, and then it turned out that [Annamaria] already knew about me from some people with who had participated in a workshop before. It was destiny!” “Correspondents from ORF TV came and interviewed Momina and I,” said Annamaria. “And then came the idea of a workshop, supported by AMS-I realized that I can share my knowledge with women refugees, as they are registered with AMS, and I can learn from them! For example, Momina has a great experience, and I learned many tricks from her. After Momina I trained Seda from Chechnya. She studied fashion. Refugees have amazing culture. The women — they know how to use their hands, they know how to sew, they cook amazing food. But then they have to come to a new country fit into a new system with different standards. It is a very difficult work and takes a lot of time.” From your experience and what you’ve learned from your employees, why do you think it’s so difficult to fit into a new system? First of all, because it’s personal, it is about PEOPLE. Refugees are people, and everybody has their own way of coping with a new situation. I don’t really like the word “integration” because it implies there is a uniform which you have to wear to be accepted. Actually, it’s about refugees finding their place here. I can do something about that. Even inviting a woman from Syria to have a coffee with me and to make a bag together—for me it’s already amazing. To start with something small. So my idea was to put these three values together: to work with my hands, to help women and to change perceptions. I really believe in it, it’s my philosophy. How has Impact Hub had an impact on your project? “My next thought was how to employ women refugees on a permanent basis. My aim is to hire at least one person by the end of this year, renovate the space and make my project financially sustainable. I want Momina to have a fixed place. The public institutions offer work on a project basis for several months. I want to hire refugees for a longer period of time. That’s why we need a help of business professionals. It was a bit difficult at the beginning, because I felt a bit insecure and thought I was being too idealistic, a “hippe” thinking I could change the world. Fortunately, I met other people at Impact Hub Vienna who feel the same way I do, and who I can learn from. You can move mountains with that. How has participating in the found! accelerator program, which is made in cooperation with the Deloitte Future Fund, impacted your business? Photo credit: Andreea Goldgrabber.“In November of the last year I contacted Impact Hub and was invited to participate in the found! accelerator program supported by Deloitte Austria. This project is really amazing. Thanks to it, more people can learn about my story and my plans. They can see us, see the women and the bags they make. During the program, I also receive a lot of training and participate in workshops. I now have two business mentors from Deloitte Austria who are helping us with business and marketing plans. With this, I can go to business institutions with a serious business plan and seek investment. Tell me about your brand name, Bags with Legs. “My bags are quite big, and when a woman goes with such a bag, it seems that her legs carry that bag.” Annamaria makes bags mainly from local materials including leather and waterproof fabric. She explains, “The line is very simple. For example, the bag can be made from «golden» fabric, but if the line is simple, it looks modern. And I have direct contact with my clients – if something is happening with the bag, I am keen to repair it. It’s a human guarantee.” Check out Bags with Legs products and learn more on their Facebook page.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-9.13.35-AM-600x400.png","March 26, 2019","en",0.99551659822464,0.000165915542311268,0.546806119382381,0.000458753187558614,0.45256919786334
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/04/02/understanding-circular-economy/","ImpactHub","Understanding Circular Economy"," As the public calls for sweeping reform in how we as society produce and consumer goods, one clear answer emerges-building a circular economy. The circular economy is the conscious design and use of resources which allows for maximum sustainability, the antithesis of our current linear economy where we produce, buy, and dispose. The core principles of the circular economy revolve around reduction, reuse, and recycling. The way our current economies are structured is destroying the planet. We design products with planned obsolescence to encourage turnover. Think about fast fashion or even your phone–it’s not a coincidence that your clothes fall apart after a few washes and that you feel the need to upgrade your phone every year or two. Producers design things that won’t last, so you’ll purchase more. The circular economy wants to change all that. The idea is to design products and product life cycle systems which minimize and eliminate waste while allowing for the reuse and recycling of a product when it can no longer be used. For all you visual learners, here is a quick video to help explain: Back from the video? Good. Now, here are the principles of the circular economy. When producing new products (or buying products for that matter) products that contribute to a circular economy follow these principles. Biodegradable materials. It sounds like a no-brainer, but producers are not using as many biodegradable materials as they should. Circular economies build this core value into the manufacturing process ensuring that products at the end of their life cycles can return to the Earth in a safe and natural way. Renewable energy. It’s not just about the materials you use to manufacture products. The supply chain and manufacturing process should rely exclusively on renewable energy ensuring that the energy needed to produce a product does not hurt the environment and isn’t wasted. Reuse waste. If it isn’t biodegradable, it needs to be reused. It is critical in the circular economy that nothing is wasted and that non-biodegradable elements are reused in the next generation of products. Repair. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But if it is, then fix it. Things break down all the time but instead of throwing them immediately in the dump, we should fix them. Eco-design. This incorporates all the elements above. From day one, a product should be designed with a thorough consideration of its environmental impact pre-and post-life cycle. Rethink ownership. One of the main aspects of the circular economy is changing the structure of how we use durable products like washing machines and computers. Instead of being owners of our devices, we would lease, license, or share them and be users under the agreement that at the end of a product’s life, it will be returned and disassembled. Reusable parts would then be incorporated in the next generation of devices. Check out this diagram to see the principles of circular economy in action What’s next In order for the circular economy to succeed, it requires a substantial change in the way we do things. Manufacturers and consumers need to rethink their behavior for it to work. Producers need to recognize that resources should not be exploited but used responsibly. Consumers need to advocate and support products and systems that practice circular economy principles. For more information about the circular economy including case studies, check out the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Untitled-design-12-600x330.png","April 2, 2019","en",0.990137755870819,0.00367469131015241,0.770536720752716,0.00844753812998533,0.217341080307961
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/04/15/founder-spotlight-karina-lackner-kicken-ohne-grenzen/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Karina Lackner, Kicken Ohne Grenzen","Today we have the pleasure to feature another participant of the found! 2019 accelerator program. The project «Job Goals» provides vocational training and coaching to young people, whose families were forced to emigrate to Austria. This initiative is created by a non-profit association «Kicken Ohne Grenzen», which has been engaged in helping children and young people develop soft skills through football training for the fourth year in a row. We talked with one of the founders of this organisation, Karina Lackner. WHY FOOTBALL? Karina Lackner: Together with my college Alois Gstöttner we started this project in 2015 when the refugee crisis happened. We wanted to offer some leisure time activities for young refugees, and we immediately thought about football because we had made some football projects before and we knew that football can have an impact on young people. We started to offer free football training. At that time we all had other jobs, for example, I worked as a software developer, so it was a voluntary project for us – we did not have any funding, any organisation. Very soon we started to offer football training for women as well. We realised that this kind of training can give much more than just some activity in the afternoon, that it is also a great tool for empowerment, for building self-esteem, especially for young women with a Muslim background. We started to build our project around this. In the first year, we were looking for donors who could allow us to use football fields for free, and we also used fields owned by the city council. It was a mixture of different solutions. In the beginning, it was quite easy because the goodwill and engagement of people were very high. However, as we started to grow and run the project on a more professional basis, it became more difficult for us. Right now we are renting football fields regularly and paying the rental fee because it gives more stability and you don’t depend on people who give it to you for free. It gives more sustainability. Copyright Sebastian Wahlhuetter HOW DOES FOOTBALL TRAINING HELP THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR ASSIMILATION IN AUSTRIA? Football game allows delivering soft skills in a very practical way. It is more than just feeling and being healthy. We developed a concept of training, which includes decision making, conflict management, leadership, and also skills young people could use for employability. But still, it was a normal football training – for example, exercising and games with certain rules, based on decision making. And afterwards, people had the possibility to reflect on what they did, to talk about how to develop and use these skills in daily life. After 3 years], we became more experienced and also, together with a dozen other partners in the same field, we became part of an EU association for football for development. We are networking and creating exercises and collecting tools kits together. In our team, there are 25 people, including employees and volunteers – teachers, social workers and coaches. HOW DO YOU FINANCE YOUR ACTIVITIES? We have been lucky because we have got support from FIFA Foundation and also from SOL Foundation, which is specialising in sports for development. Recently we have got a positive response for a grant from UEFA Foundation for Children. These three foundations are founding the base program. Of course, we applied and have gotten some help from the City Council, and we also get private donations. CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR BENEFICIARIES? Now we have 120 beneficiaries across four teams, which means four weekly evening sessions. Two male teams, one group of young women and one kids team, with the children between eight and fourteen years old. Most of them have a migrational background. The first big group were young refugees, but now the teams are more open, more mixed, so we have young kids from different kinds of underprivileged communities. The teams are open to everybody, and we also have Austrians, who were interested in involving themselves in the project – it’s a great advantage for the other participants. Most of the kids who come to us are lost somehow and dropped out of the system. Some of them finished school or have never even been to school, and they are in some parallel culture where they just don’t know what to do. In the beginning, they don’t realise that they get so much more outcome than just running around with a ball by participating in our project. Copyright Petra RautenstrauchHOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO JOIN YOUR TEAMS? Actually, it works on a personal level. People bring friends and relatives – brothers, sisters, daughters, cousins. We also cooperate with charity organisations, for example with Caritas. So we never experienced the need to be active in searching for participants. Our doors are open, and in the beginning young people come to us just to play football, and in the process, we integrate them in our other educational offers, and also in the projects of the City, which sometimes cannot them reach so easily. A lot of women, who play in our teams can be with their friends, organize workshops or go for vocational job training – now we have all these additional educational programs. WHAT IS THE «JOB GOALS» PROJECT? As part of the found! accelerator program at Impact Hub, we developed a project called «Job Goals». It is aimed at young people between the ages of 16-24 who were participating in our football trainings for a while and are already empowered to have professional experience and who also have already a good level of German. They get a CV and job coaching: specialists from Deloitte give them pieces of advice on the interests they have and on what would be good for them to do. And then we connect them to companies, which give them vocational job trainings. All this started last year without any funding, it was a pure experiment. Until now, 15 young people have had a possibility to do it, and at the Impact Hub Vienna, we are developing a project, which would be more sustainable and would have a bigger scale and also funding, of course. We invite partners from companies, which support us or who would like to involve their employees as corporative volunteers. But it is still very connected to football because these are the people who were reached through football and who developed their skills through football. We know them – we have been with them for 3 years, we know their personalities, and the relationships are much deeper than for example, relationships they have built in AMS. Copyright Sebastian WahlhuetteAT WHAT STAGE IS THE «JOB GOALS» PROJECT NOW? For example, someone has a retail business and tells us: I need a young worker with good communication skills. And we think of who we have with these skills in our group and who would be interested in such work experience. So we connect them and they organize job training days. This is already happening. But the goal we are developing with Impact Hub is that every member of our teams could participate in this project. We want to have it more structured so that every week there are such trainings available. We want to establish a permanent course and the goals which the participants have to reach in order to finish the program with success and to become competitive on a labour market. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO INVEST YOUR BUDGET INTO NEXT? We will need 2-3 permanent employees for this project, and a part of this money would be spent on specific football trainings, because we still want to develop the life skills during this program. And we also want very much to involve some big companies in our project through the found! accelerator program. We have sponsors’ packages developed together with our Deloitte mentors. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT WIN THE FUNDING THROUGH found! ACCELERATOR? We have already started this project, it was not something invented specifically for this accelerator programme, so we will keep doing it anyway. Of course, we would like to have more resources. But we will try to find the money somewhere else. WHAT CHALLENGES DOES YOUR PROJECT FACE RIGHT NOW? The political situation is very difficult for us. Sports ministry was funding us but with the arrival of the new government, they cut the funding. That’s why we realised that our funding strategy should not be so dependent on the internal political situation and that we should look for international funding opportunities. And another problem is that women’s football in Austria is very underrepresented. Many people think: It’s a nice hobby, but you don’t need any money for it, just play football. But in fact, football is a really powerful tool for development.

It is the holy grail: work-life balance. Decades ago, futurists predicted how technology would liberate us from the drudgery of work. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes believed we would be working 15-hour weeks. Fast forward to the present, technology has advanced in ways few of us could’ve imagined. A computer has shrunk from the size of an entire room to the size of a human hand. And yet, most of us are working more than ever before. Technology has given work the ability to creep into our home life. But is it just an issue caused by the rise of technology? Or are we causing ourselves this mental strife? Some estimates say that over half of workers are burning out. The 15-hour week still seems a long way off so until it happens, let’s look at ways we can find a work-life balance and keep our sanity in check. Say no This is not the easiest thing to do and may not even be possible for most workers. But sometimes, you need to be the one to push back against your boss and tell them no to a project you know is going to eat more of your time. Sometimes, this ‘no’ is you saying it to yourself. Hard work does pay off in the long-run but at what cost? Ambition won’t get you anywhere if you burn out too fast. Life isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon. So pace yourself. And know that there are no shortcuts. Assess where you are right now Be realistic with what you can achieve. We all want to change the world for the better but if you don’t achieve it this second, the world’s not going to end. We all have deadlines to meet, meetings to attend, and KPIs to achieve. But if the stress is getting to you, try to step back and take an objective view. What’s the worst thing that can happen if you miss a deadline? And what is that worth to you? Are you just your job? With the continual fading of barriers between work and life, it’s easy for many people to make work their entire life and derive almost all of their value from it. But think about that for a second, are you just your job? Take some time to think about where that line between your work and your life should be. Look at the other parts of your life where you find value like your friends or sports. Reorganizing where you get value will also reorganize the importance you put on work. Start small You will probably need to restructure some aspects of your life. Whether it’s making more time for your friends and family or just making time for yourself. A complete overhaul is probably not going to be possible unless it’s absolutely necessary. So start small and make gradual changes. If you eat lunch at your desk to get more work done, that’s exactly the place to start. Exercise and meditate Exercise has been proven to be an effective relief for stress. Like the point above, start small. Go for a walk. Take 5 minutes and then make it 10. Pretty soon you’ll be in the swing of things and jogging for 30 minutes will be the norm. Meditation has also been shown to relieve stress. Taking as little as 10 minutes to center yourself and be mindful of how you’re feeling can do wonders. It might also reveal the next steps you need to take for the proper work-life balance. The way forward There are greater things in this world than work. While it gives many of us purpose, it can also grind us down. The points above are just guidelines. Since everyone’s different, you need to find what works for you. But the first step is always recognizing your needs. So start there.

He even wrote in his diary that “music is a stenograph of feelings” and committed long hours pondering the effect music has on human emotions. It’s difficult not to consider the very same sentence when one witnesses one of the spontaneous piano concerts in the city made possible by Open Piano for Refugees. Open Piano for Refugees, run in cooperation with the social music institute DoReMi where refugees are employed as music instructors, is one of the ventures participating in the found! 2019 accelerator program. The initiative places pianos in open public spaces to invite integration through music, strengthening the social participation of refugees and social cohesion. We spoke to one of the people behind this musical initiative – Lena Parzer. What inspired you to create an initiative that supports refugee assimilation? We wanted to inspire the public to enter into an exchange with each other, to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, and to give the refugees an opportunity to present themselves positively – through the path of music. Why piano? A piano stands out – it not only looks good but also reaches an unbelievable number of people acoustically. And that is, after all, the goal – to inspire as many people as possible with it. The piano functions not only as a musical instrument but also as an integration instrument. A piano offers the possibility to play it together, but also to play it together with other instruments or to accompany a choir or vocals. Photo courtesy of Open Piano for Refugees How did you create the network of partners you have today? Our motto is: Whoever asks wins. We presented our project to our current partners and everyone was enthusiastic about the idea right from the start. In the meantime, people know us, either because they have already passed an open piano and experienced the magic and dynamics of the project for themselves, or because they have heard of us from friends or through the media. We ourselves all have a connection to music and know musicians, who in turn introduce us to new people from the music scene. The big popularity results from word of mouth. What have been your biggest milestones so far? We could open our social music school DoReMi in March last year and can already teach 160 students in the 3rd semester on a “pay as much as you can” basis. Socially disadvantaged persons (with and without migration background) learn how to play an instrument together with another person, who is higher in income. We started with only 20 pupils, so this is a really big increase and shows us that there is a big necessity. Our students are all super motivated, as are our teachers, which leads us to expand this music school even further – we plan to be in other cities and even countries. Photo courtesy of Open Piano for Refugees What are the biggest challenges you have encountered? When founding an association, there are several bureaucratic things to consider. One has to deal with the requirements that such a foundation entails and then deal with employment etc.. However, there is no challenge in itself that cannot be mastered – we have many talented and skilful people around our core team who stand by us in the most diverse matters, should we not be able to cover them ourselves. What are the logistics of organising Open Piano for Refugees? First of all, we have to organise the location itself – we have to contact the shopping centres in the winter season and the public authorities in the summer season, to get permission to play in the streets. Then there is a grand piano to organize and in consequence the piano transport. And of course, we need a piano supervisor for each location to ensure that everything runs smoothly. How is found! supporting you? How are you utilising the programme? The people who support us at found! all come from the professional field – there is an incredible amount of input and very helpful ideas. We are currently working on the definition of the task packages, we are working on our organizational structure. In addition, we are currently setting up some marketing strategies, with the mentors of found! actively supporting us. Photo by Johanna Leitner The best moment of the program so far was… To get to know all the other great participants and initiators of the projects and to see how much time and motivation these people put into their startups to make the world a bit better! What’s next for Open Piano for Refugees? We are in the process of organizing the summer locations, from May on we will be hosting our Open Piano almost every weekend in a different city in Austria and Germany. The ‘We are Vienna Festival’ in June is also just around the corner, where we will be standing with our grand piano in every district for 23 days. And in the long run, the expansion of our music institute is on the agenda – we will not only leave it at Vienna <U+0001F609> Find out more about Open Piano for Refugees on their website, or follow them on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Piano-for-Refugees-Impact-Hub-Interview-1140x407-600x400.png","May 13, 2019","en",0.996459543704987,0.000451036783488235,0.661721140146255,0.00756228464888409,0.330265514552593

But there’s still more to be done and we are excited to help more founders to realise their ideas of making Vienna a better place to live,” added Ioana Constantin, Acceleration Unit Lead at Impact Hub Vienna Not surprisingly, the ventures for this year’s incubation track with Oeko Business Wien are addressing the circular economy, moving beyond single-use plastic, social involvement as well as sustainable local food.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/05/20/challenge-yourself-grow-the-experience-of-a-european-volunteer/","ImpactHub","Challenge yourself & grow: The experience of a European volunteer","For you personally, what does the Erasmus+ volunteering service stand for and why did you decide to do this type of volunteering? Alexandra Pediakova: For me, European Voluntary Service (EVS) is an opportunity to live in a different country, to be involved in activities I wouldn’t be otherwise, and to get to know great people. In addition, it’s a chance to interact with new cultural and ideological bubbles (and learn how to say bubble in different languages, like Romanian). I worked as a volunteer before in different organizations, so the idea of volunteering was nothing new to me. Nikola Simcuvova: EVS is an opportunity for young people to come into contact with different cultures and languages while acquiring new skills and valuable international experience. It’s also a great experience to be able to work on meaningful projects supporting the development of local communities. I decided to relocate to Vienna and do the EVS at Impact Hub Vienna because I was eager to try something new and curious to get to know the social business and startup scenes. Why did you choose Impact Hub Vienna and what were your tasks as a volunteer? Alexandra: I knew Impact Hub already from their location in Brno, Czech Republic and thought it was a cool place to spend my time. I wanted something meaningful, and somewhere I could practice my German language skills, so I decided to apply for the EVS in Impact Hub Vienna. At the beginning, I started as a host. It was the right job to get to know what Impact Hub is and meet different members of the community. Later during the program, I became involved as an Event Coordinator. This position helped me to be part of many diverse events. Nikola: I was pretty familiar with the global network of Impact Hubs, but I have never been a part of one before. I found it fascinating how business and social spheres could be combined and how Impact Hubs support startups via different accelerator programs, workshops, mentoring, community connections, etc. As a volunteer, I was a part of the Community team and had multiple roles which enabled me to try basically anything I wanted to. I organized community events, coordinated volunteers, administered social media and other online marketing platforms, facilitated connections between members and co-organized CEE Impact Day 2018 which is the largest social impact conference in Central & Eastern Europe. Looking back at the last year, what was your personal highlight of your European Voluntary Service? Alexandra: My personal highlights were the people I met and the atmosphere of Impact Hub. For me, it was important to meet people who care about the earth, other people spread a positive attitude and good vibes.Nikola: My biggest highlight of the whole EVS experience was the community. I met plenty of like-minded people and was constantly inspired by their personalities, stories, and accomplishments. The community is very unique in the way everyone supports each other, shares the same values and works hard towards the same goal is. It is, in my opinion, the core of the whole organization. From my personal perspective, I enjoying experiencing a significant amount of personal growth. I realized that I can basically do anything, even though things might have seemed impossible at the first, I always managed to navigate my way through difficult projects and tasks. I trust my skills and abilities much more now than ever before. What societal challenges in Slovakia do you think social entrepreneurship can help to address? Alexandra: There are big gaps in the educational system in Slovakia that social entrepreneurship can help (and has already started to help) address. In particular, I am referring to the Roma minority, challenges around integration and social inclusion. Of course, there are many other societal challenges that we have in Slovakia, such as health and well-being. Nikola: Compared to Austria or other EU countries, Slovakia has a low awareness and understanding of the concept of social entrepreneurship, and the infrastructure supporting social enterprises is very limited. In spite of that, I see plenty of opportunities to address societal challenges through social entrepreneurship. For example, challenges like the aging of the population, high unemployment in many regions of the country, as well as significant Roma community, are things that can be improved upon by the creation of social businesses. How would you finish the sentence “For me Impact is…” Alexandra: …thinking about the world I am living in and acting as a part of a community. Nikola: Making a positive difference, spreading good, leaving a mark. If you could recommend one thing to the next volunteer who comes to Impact Hub Vienna what would it be? Alexandra: Just do what gives you joy and don’t be afraid to ask for advice or help <U+0001F642> Nikola: Challenge yourself! Learn more about Erasmus+ here.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/06/04/four-tips-for-hosting-sustainable-events/","ImpactHub","Four Tips for Hosting Sustainable Events","If you’ve ever participated in a conference for work, you’ve probably noticed trash cans filled to the brim with catering containers, leftover food, and tons of trash. At Impact Hub Vienna, we host events on an almost daily basis, and for us, it’s really important to consider how we can make our events environmentally friendly. The question of how to make a positive environmental impact is also related to the events we host and the catering companies we work with every day. Even the smallest thing can make a difference. So how do we minimize our impact on the world with our events? Go local Our catering is provided by local firms which use organic, seasonal, and locally grown produce. Event goers will see that apple pies are in full swing in the fall, asparagus dishes can be found in abundance in spring, and there are no strawberry desserts for Christmas! Snacks and beverages provided for coffee breaks are also locally produced and we buy them in bulk so that we reduce CO2 emissions caused by the back and forth transport of food. For everything else that we need to make our guests happy and productive, we buy from the stores in our neighborhood to support local businesses. Also Rita Bringt’s, one of our caterers, brings food by bike, which also reduces our carbon footprint, and uses palm leaf plates that are biodegradable. Reduce plastic Plastic and package reduction is one of the biggest challenges we face. We are constantly trying to improve and think about how we can reduce that waste. We don’t use plastic dishes, cutlery, or cups we use napkins from 100% recycled materials and are always looking for ways to reduce the use of packaging of food and drinks. We buy our drinks in refillable glass bottles and our caterers bring food in reusable glass jars in order to reduce plastic packaging. We also have recycling bins in the event spaces to encourage our guests to properly dispose of their waste. Reduce food waste Food waste is an important and ever-present issue with events. We are very careful to order portions according to the number of event attendees. If there is food left over after an event, we usually offer it to our community. Also, the catering firms we work with often have their own solutions to preventing food waste from their services. Companies such as iss mich bring larger amounts of leftovers back to their kitchen or distribute it in town via foodsharing, which are the public fridges that are accessible to everyone. During the month of May, we collaborated with one of our ventures, Süd & Satz, to collect coffee residue in a special waste bin, which is then used as soil for growing mushrooms. Reduce meat consumption This topic is still a bit controversial, but we encourage our clients to opt for vegetarian and vegan-only catering. Of course, we have to meet all client needs but we always educate our clients about some of the amazing veggie catering options they have, and they are usually happy to use them. We’ve built a big network of catering suppliers that are vegetarian and vegan only, so there is a lot to choose from. If we still need to offer meat dishes, our suppliers use organic, and locally grown meat. Hosting sustainable events requires a little bit more planning, research and thought, but in the long run, once the foundation is there, it is easier to organize environmentally friendly events and reduce our footprint on our planet!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/06/11/storytelling-for-social-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Storytelling for social entrepreneurs","Recently, Davorin Barudzija, an integrative trainer, coach, and recruitment manager at Teach for Austria hosted an eye-opening skillshare breakfast about storytelling at the Hub. He drew upon his years of experience in adult vocational training to activate the innate storytelling abilities of all the attendees. Ever find yourself trying to tell an important story but tripping over the words? Things that were meant to be told at the end somehow find themselves in the beginning and the beginning all of sudden becomes the middle and before you know it, the story’s backward and forward at the same time and your audience is lost. Storytelling goes beyond one-to-one communication. Every startup has their story to charm potential investors, partners, and employees. If you’re a social entrepreneur, you have your story and nobody can tell but you. If you’re looking to inspire others to follow your lead, here are four tips to take your storytelling to the next level. Make it personal The more honest you are, the easier it will be to tell your story and the more likely a listener will be moved and connect with your story. Activate your listener’s empathy. We’re all different but we’ve experienced the same emotions. We’ve all been happy, sad, and somewhere in between. Build the bridge to your audience by opening yourself up. It might be scary at first to be vulnerable, but that’s how you connect with other people. Paint a picture Activate a listener’s senses. Where were you? What did it look like? What did it smell like? How did you feel? Painting a picture orients the listener and draws them into your story. They begin to see things the way you see them and feel closer to you. Have you heard the saying: “walk a mile in (someone’s) shoes?” Using descriptive language helps your audience to go for a walk in your shoes. Pause You’ve probably seen it in every TED talk: the dramatic pause. Notice how you probably leaned in to hear more, eager for the next words from the speaker. You should do that too. Why? Because it works. It allows the story you’re telling to settle in the minds of your listeners and builds anticipation to what’s coming next. You probably have a natural instinct to cover every bit of silence thinking that the audience is going to be bored if you stop talking. It’s actually the opposite. So take your time and remember to breathe at the right spots. Use silence to your advantage. Practice, practice, practice You won’t tell your story right the 1st time, or the 5th time, or even the 10th time. But every time you do, you’ll improve it in small increments. You’ll take all the cues and feedback from every listener and hone in on what works. So what are you waiting for? Go out and tell your story. Tell it to your friend or someone at the Hub. The most important thing is that you tell your story because nobody can tell it but you.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/06/26/social-challenges-innovation-platform-report/","ImpactHub","How the Social Challenges Innovation Platform Matches Social Challenges with Innovative Solution Providers","How do small and medium-sized enterprises and social innovation fit together? Often referred to as the backbone of the European economy, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a focal point in shaping enterprise policy in the European Union. In 2015, SMEs represented 99 % of all enterprises in the EU! While social innovation has become an established movement around the world, it has not yet managed to sufficiently penetrate the ranks of SMEs, the sector most relevant for furthering the development goals of the social innovation agenda. The Social Challenges Innovation Platform encourages sustainable, marketable innovations with clear social benefits by matching “Challenge Owners” – organisations with problems to solve – with creative entrepreneurs and social innovators. In a nutshell, SCHIP has created a matchmaking platform where social needs meet sustainable and innovative solutions, which you can visit under socialchallenges.eu. “As the City of Vienna and the environmental department is working towards a sustainable future for its citizens as well as companies, SMEs and start-ups, it is important for us to also have the right tools for their participation. The SHIP project was a perfect „playground“ for trying out an innovative online participation tool as a pilot project for further decisions and developments‘, commented Bertram Häupler from OekoBusiness Wien, one of the Challenge Owners. The Platform is powered by Meta Group, EBN and Impact Hub, under the management of the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME) and with the support of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme. Where a challenge is transformed into a new business opportunity When SCHIP launched in 2016, the objectives of the project were not only to create awareness and facilitate the interaction among a wide range of stakeholders relevant for the platform but also to identify high-impact social challenges Europe is facing today and kick-start a collaboration between SMEs and social innovators to address these challenges. Part of the SCHIP efforts is to provide financial support through grants in the amount of €30k each and six months’ worth of training and mentoring to help translate social innovators’ pitches into practical, marketable solutions. Today we are checking in with five social innovators who submitted their pitches to the SCHIP platform and who were selected to make their ideas a reality. Unverschwendet The challenge: Make conscious consumption mainstream in Vienna. Farmers are forced to produce up to 200% of the amount of fruit needed to ensure that enough of them meet the excessive market norms. The highly specialized requirements of supermarkets for shape, colour and size of fruits lead to a surplus of up to 500 kg per day for one small farm. In most cases, these surplus fruits are thrown away. Unverschwendet turns excess fruits and vegetables into delicious products such as jam, syrup, chutneys, pickles, sweets, ketchup, sauces and more. This culinary solution is a tool in the fight against food waste! In the long-term, Unverschwendet wanted to offer various large scale solutions for preventing waste of surplus food. The social enterprise is run by siblings, Cornelia and Andreas Diesenreiter, who are supported by a great team and partners. Some SCHIP Milestones: With SCHIP’s help, through their research and networking, Unverschwendet built partnerships with three well-established food producers who will help them to scale their production over the next three years. Unverschwendet won both start-up programs from the two biggest food retailers in Austria for nationwide listing and they are currently in the final stage of negotiations. Together with WWF Austria Unverschwendet launched an online campaign on food waste in order to inform people on the Food Overshoot Day. erdbeerewoche The challenge: Make conscious consumption mainstream in Vienna. erdbeerwoche is an innovative e-commerce platform that is both an awareness-raising tool as well as an online shop for sustainable feminine hygiene products. erdbeerwoche decided to create an extension to their offering – an e-learning platform for teenagers that educate boys and girls between 13 and 16 years about the topic of menstruation and sustainable feminine hygiene. With the prototype of an e-learning platform for teenagers “Ready for Red”, erdbeerwoche are the first to provide a holistic learning experience about menstruation and sustainable feminine hygiene by providing unique content in a way that teenagers like to learn: interactive, funny and with a lot of videos and games. Some SCHIP Milestones: erdbeerwoche approached more than 200 schools in Vienna and established successful collaborations such as the collaboration with the City of Vienna. erdbeerwoche developed a webinar series to train teachers on how to use “Ready for Red” in classes. The “Ready for Red” team trained 140 teachers in nine one- hour webinar sessions. One of the most valuable outcomes of SCHIP was that erdbeerwoche had the chance to test the prototype of “Ready for Red” and develop a business model that provides longterm sustainability and represents a completely new income stream for erdbeerwoche. “Ready for Red” won the Next award and has been nominated for the “Get active social business award” (October 2018). Wohnbuddy.com (by WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen) The challenge: Fight marginalization in Vienna. WGE is a social enterprise that matches the elderly and retirement homes via the wohnbuddy.com platform with suitable buddies for co-living. These co-living buddies are mostly young people, who provide time for common activities as well as everyday support for a low-cost room. WGE! developed a prototype of a new online platform called wohnbuddy.com to improve the matching process and vacancy management, enabling the company to increase its impact and to scale the business to other European cities. Some SCHIP Milestones: WGE! Met their initial objective, the development of a prototype of an online platform, at the end of March 2019. WGE! Was invited to participate in a panel discussion about “The Future of Living” organized by the Viennese People’s Party. WGE! met a lot of stakeholders and could acquire two new partnerships with well-established organizations from the area of Social Services in Austria through SCHIP. Kuorum The challenge: fight marginalization in Vienna. The City of Vienna is committed to reducing inequality, but the political misrepresentation of immigrants can lead to marginalization and social conflicts. The Integration and Diversity Unit of the city council of Vienna can benefit from implementing novel means of civic participation. But it is equally important to be able to measure the impact of those innovative solutions in order to monitor their achievements. Kuorum is a technology consultancy firm that provides solutions to support collaborative problem solving and citizen engagement. Kuorum’s technology – aimed at local governments, corporations and organizations – is free and the only charges applied are for customizations and ad hoc software development. Their submitted pitch was for an idea centred around fostering the diverse civic engagement through training and online debates among local politicians and young immigrants. Some SCHIP Milestones: The Engagement Platform was translated to German and launched in July. There was a severe delay in the selection of the training partner, which caused the training to start in January instead of September. After the initial training session, the youngsters started to participate in the platform. In March the youngsters met again with the training partner in order to work further on their proposals. Finally, some of the youngsters will present their proposals in front of district elected officials. Kuorum collected all the information from the training partner to produce a final report. Lesson learned: Without involving someone in the city council who is responsible for citizen engagement, dissemination is hard, as Kuorum didn’t have permission to use the official channels and logos. SHADES TOURS The challenge: fight marginalization in Vienna. SHADES TOURS organizes alternative tours and activities in Vienna on socially polarizing topics. The difference in comparison to regular tours is that the tours are guided by affected persons themselves and therefore provide a different perspective on the city. SHADES TOURS showed a proof of concept in 2016-2018 and began developing new ways to integrate marginalized groups back into society and back into the labour market. Their SCHIP proposal was to create a new product, “Tours Guided by Refugees”, and start working on the upcoming tour product on the topic of Drugs & Addictions. Some SCHIP Milestones: SHADES TOURS conducted focus groups and a survey with employees of different Viennese companies and another survey with social institutions. The employee survey delivered the prerequisites of Social Team Building activities, whereby the survey to the institutions provided a clearer picture of their needs. The newly developed tours and presentations were able to sell to 1,149 participants on the topic of refugees & integration. SHADES TOURS found a mentor Andreas Heinecke – founder of Dialogue in the Dark, who will help them develop the required legal and structural documents for the Social Franchise.

Not to mention starting a new business! The founders of KulturenReich know exactly how it feels. KulturenReich is a social enterprise built by foreign-born women, who, having faced the challenges of being new in Vienna, help other foreign-born women through their supportive community and an entrepreneurship academy focused on business skills. We spoke to Amarilla Nirmala, KulturenReich’s own Chief Marketing Whizz, about their idea, plans and their participation in the found! 2019 accelerator program. What inspired you to launch KulturenReich? KulturenReich started when Tila (Asetila Köstinger), who was a total stranger at that time, reached us through a Facebook group, asking about voluntarily activity for a social initiative. We first met in January 2018, all foreign-born Viennese ourselves. We, although never met before, talked about the struggles and challenges we had upon arriving in this beautiful city. We all have our own personal stories and realised how similar they were. We realized that complaining and whining won’t solve any problems, and this should be a mindset of all foreign-born and migrant women. Hence, we decided to take the matter into our hands, to help other ladies, who have similar struggles. KulturenReich isn’t only based on personal experience, but also through surveys and validation in foreign-born, expat, and migrant communities. They have experienced some bumps to start their professional lives again in Austria. Learning curve and uncertainty are real. So we launched KulturenReich as a way to support each other because we believe international talents with so much cultural understanding is one of the strong pillars in today’s economy. How does KulturenReich work? We support women through entrepreneurship academy, a supportive group and on-job training. We provide know-how tools about business, mainly minor, startup, and small businesses initiatives. Plus we are currently preparing our on-job training scheme, dedicated to bridge the CV gap and introduce the ladies to the Viennese work environment. Photo © Tamás KünsztlerAs foreign women in Vienna, how did you find the business registration process to be? Vienna offers many channels of support through the government, however, foreign-born women and migrants are often afraid to use these services or speak up. Often times the information is misunderstood. That’s why KulturenReich, since March 2019, is in an official agreement with Vienna Business Agency, and currently, they support our events, and workshops in a specific topic in terms of setting up a business. We would like to be more present and have more collaborative partners, so we can help more foreign-born and migrant women to get clarity and guide them in their entrepreneurial journey. From us, they will get a supportive group and know-how tools, and from respective partners, they will get thorough regulatory information. What stage is your startup at right now? We officially started in January 2018, we launched at the EXPAT Centre with support from Vienna Business Agency in June and officially registered as an association (Verein) in the same month. We provide our services and are currently focusing on revenue stream and sustainability. We are strengthening our community, and progressing to our fourth academy namely We DO Academy in Autumn 2019. What has been the response to your initiative? I think such an initiative is very much needed. When you move to a new country, there are many things to learn and absorb and often times it is too much. Foreign-born and migrant women need a supportive group where they can build each other and reach the top together. We have been growing our community to nearly 600 people organically, and with 30-80 people actively coming to our events. We would like to increase the number of participants at our academy, and as a community, we aim to double size this year. It is a warm feeling when people mention that they like our initiative. We are friends with the ladies, who use our services, not only as members but as a big family because we believe in cooperation. Which of the training programs you offer is the most popular? Pitching preparation, business model canvas, and marketing are three subjects that are most attractive. And as we are in collaboration with the Vienna Business Agency, the basic information about setting up a business is always interesting. What do you see as the main challenges foreign women face in Austria? The biggest ones are the language and network. What are the three most important skills would you say women entering the workforce in Austria should focus on improving? Networking, language, and to know your niche. Which part of found! program has been the most helpful? The Deloitte mentors with whom we have had a great time. We were able to get very much needed support from them, such as the preparation of a financial plan. Also, the workshop with startups during which we got valuable insights from other social entrepreneurs. Why do you think accelerator programs such as found! are important to start-ups? As Marieke Pluk, Impact Hub Program Manager responsible for found!, said, social entrepreneurs cannot work alone, we need partners and we need support. found! has been a great help for us because it increases our visibility not only as a social business but also it brings awareness that problems faced by our niche aren’t exclusive. This is a challenge, we as a community, -all Viennese- need to solve together What’s your main focus at the moment? We are preparing our upcoming event, Find Your Female Co-Founder #3, a platform to match entrepreneurs to meet their potential partners. Not only women but men are also very much welcomed at this event! Secondly, we are focusing on strengthening our community through breakfast meetups, where we share challenges and solve them together through our varied expertise. Thirdly, we are preparing our career incubator (on-job training). More information to come soon! Visit Kulturenreich’s website or follow them on Facebook, Instagram and/or LinkedIn. You can also register for their upcoming Find Your Female Co-Founder #3 event here!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Founder-Spotlight-Amarilla-Nirmala-from-KultuenReich-600x400.png","June 28, 2019","en",0.996347904205322,0.000727699283743277,0.640403747558594,0.00157348572975025,0.35729505866766
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/07/01/lets-talk-food-waste-in-austria/","ImpactHub","Let’s Talk Food Waste in Austria","Austrians throw away one-fifth of all food they buy (Source), of which 14.5% is avoidable or partly avoidable and amounts to 1 billion Euro per year (Source). Austrian consumers are responsible for almost half of the total waste, while agricultural production generates around 30 per cent of the total food waste. Farmers, manufacturers, retailers, and foodservice operators (e.g. hotels, restaurants, caterers) in Austria either produce too much food, which never reaches consumers, or experience food losses through inefficient storage, transportation, or demand planning. Local food loss and waste are never local – they cause ripples impacting market food prices and also contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions. Countries such as Austria, with its developed infrastructure and available economic and social resources, need to lead the way in creating solutions to systematic food waste. Understanding Food Waste First, a simple distinction: food loss vs food waste, as defined by FAO. Food loss refers to any food that is lost in the supply chain between the producer and the market. This may be the result of pre-harvest problems, such as pest infestations, or problems in harvesting, handling, storage, packing or transportation. Some of the underlying causes of food loss include the inadequacy of infrastructure, markets, price mechanisms or even the lack of legal frameworks. Food waste, on the other hand, refers to the discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption. In developed countries, at the retail level, large quantities of food are wasted due to quality standards that over-emphasize appearance. In developing countries, the problem is essentially due to inadequate harvest techniques, poor post-harvest management, lack of suitable infrastructure, processing and packaging, and a lack of marketing information (Source). Impact of Food Waste on Resources Globally, the blue water footprint (i.e. the consumption of surface and groundwater resources) of food waste is about 250 km3, which is equivalent to three times the volume of Lake Geneva. Produced but uneaten food occupies almost 1.4 billion hectares of land; this represents close to 30% of the world’s agricultural land area. While it is difficult to estimate the impact on biodiversity at a global level, food waste is indirectly linked to such practices as monocropping and agriculture expansion into wild areas. These practices result in significant biodiversity loss, including mammals, birds, fish and amphibians (Source). In 2011, FAO estimated that each year one-third of all food produced in the world for human consumption never reached the consumer’s table, but still generated 4.4 carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2-eq), or about 8% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. This means that the contribution of food waste emissions to global warming is almost equivalent (87%) to global road transport emissions. Source: Food wastage footprint & Climate Change http://www.fao.org/3/a-bb144e.pdf When considering food waste and food loss, we also need to look closer at the social and economic impact. According to FAO, in addition to the $1 trillion of direct economic costs per year, the environmental costs of food waste reach around $700 billion and social costs reach around $900 billion (Source). The costs associated with food waste for EU-28 in 2012 are estimated at around 143 billion euros. Two-thirds of the costs are associated with food waste from households (around 98 billion euros). This is due to households a) having more edible food waste than any other sector and b) the costs associated with a tonne of food accumulating along the supply chain (e.g. processing, packaging, retailing costs) (Source). Food Waste As a Byproduct of a Poor System It is true that, in Austria, consumers can significantly contribute to minimising food waste by changing their habits. However, the issue of food waste cannot be solved solely at the consumer level. Food waste needs to be tackled at policy and infrastructure level to prevent the loss of valuable resources even before they reach consumers’ houses. Raising awareness alone will not work if the evidence-based policies preventing food waste are not implemented to transform systems and processes. One of Vienna’s startups, Paradeisa- Der Online Hofladen, currently participating in RE:WIEN 2019 accelerator program, approached the issue of food waste by changing the way consumers in Vienna shop for local products. Austria is an agricultural country with an abundance of locally produced vegetables and fruits. But access to these products is limited – either because of availability in local stores or pricing. Paradeisa, run by Markus Sitek (Management), Isabella Schieszler-Lotschak (Market Development), Michael Apostol, and Vinzenz Schwarz (both Software Development), wants to close the distance between consumers wanting seasonal, regional food at fair prices, and the producers, who want to sell their goods. The direct selling method prevents food loss occurring through traditional retail channels. Paradeisa works together with small-scale enterprises in the region. “In Austria, we are lucky to still have a lot of small farmers who produce excellent food in our vicinity. Unfortunately, it is difficult for consumers – especially in urban areas – to easily get this delicious food. This is why I created Paradeisa. My vision is to make local and seasonal food easily accessible to a large number of people – at a fair price,” explains Markus Sitek, founder of Paradeisa Sustainable production methods and animal welfare play an essential role in the selection of producers. By reducing transport distance and avoiding unnecessary packaging, the carbon footprint of the company is significantly reduced. Becoming a Conscious Buyer Combating food waste in a country such as Austria heavily relies on raising awareness of what the food waste means to us and the actions an individual can take to reduce their waste. One of the ways to mitigate food loss at your own house is to become more aware of how much perishable food you buy and how fast you actually consume it. There is a financial incentive too: Austrian households could save up to €300 annually by planning what and how much food they buy (Source). “At Paradeisa the food producers only deliver what our customers ordered and paid for in advance. So they do not have to return home from the market with unsold goods. Furthermore, our clients consume more consciously. They only buy what they really need and are not tempted by big size offers and special quantity discounts”, commented Markus. Aside from controlling how much to buy, we also need to change our perception of food quality labels and how they dictate food purchases and consumption The countless number of quality labels and marks confuse consumers and lead to uncertainty on how to make purchase decisions. A homepage specifically set up by “Verein zur Förderung von Lebensmitteln mit erhöhter Qualität” (Association for the Promotion of Foods of Higher Quality, VQL) provides a good overview of the recognised national quality labels and EU marks for foods. The ominous “Best Before” stamp is a particularly problematic label. A recent study carried out by the European Commission, published in February 2018, estimates that up to 10% of the 88 million tonnes of food waste generated annually in the EU are linked to date marking (Source). The food expiration date does not actually indicate the timeframe for food being edible – the dates solely indicate freshness and are used by manufacturers to convey when the product is at its peak. Therefore, “Best Before” date should not be used as an indicator of when food should be thrown away. And let’s not forget about the infamous vegetable and fruit “beauty standards” enforced by big retailers… “Our clients also buy – and even appreciate – vegetables and fruits which are not necessarily „ideally” shaped,” added Markus. “Farmers are not forced to throw away a large part of their harvest only because their produce does not meet the standards of big retail companies. That’s why direct sales from food producers to consumers also have a huge impact on food waste mitigation.” The Food Emergency According to Future Agenda, the current predictions of population growth mean that by 2050 we will need 60% more calories every day to feed 9 billion people. If we cut current food loss and food waste, this gap will shrink by 22%. However, solving the issue of food waste and hunger doesn’t only rely on minimising the losses – it requires a major policy overhaul, especially in terms of making nutritious food accessible and affordable to everyone. Let’s not forget local farmers, who should become part of any sustainable fair food chain to support the growing demand for food. Only when we establish a healthy, circular, and resource-efficient food system can we talk about truly solving the issue of food waste in Austria and globally.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/07/03/founder-spotlight-philipp-etzlinger-from-uugot-it/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Philipp Etzlinger from uugot.it","What’s the future of language learning? Virtual reality, online classrooms, gamification, AI? While all of these exciting technological developments are happening, one cannot deny the effectiveness of watching TV with subtitles as one of the tools to learn a language. A Viennese start-up, uugot.it, decided to combine the TV approach with new technologies and developed an innovative streaming app, which uses subtitles to help people learn German by watching local TV channels. uugot.it also recently graduated from found! 2019 accelerator program. I spoke to Philipp Etzlinger, the founder and CEO of uugot.it, about his start-up. Impact Hub Vienna: Philipp, tell me a bit about yourself. What’s your background? It must be in technology… Philipp Etzlinger: No, actually, not at all. My background is in Finance. I worked for Deloitte in the auditing department for almost seven years. Later on, I moved to ecoplus, the Business Agency of Lower Austria, where I was a project manager in the investor relations’ department. So basically I was in negotiations with mayors of villages and investors, who would like to build plants and were looking for the right places for them and consulted them on public grants. These were the main areas I focused on. When I started ecoplus, I was already working on the uugot.it idea, but it took some time before we got public funding and to find the right people and the team. So actually we founded the company in April 2016 after receiving the pledge for grants in December 2015. That’s when we started developing the whole thing. Your idea had been brewing for quite a while before you founded uugot.it. How did you get interested in language learning? The roots of this idea reach back to my time in Paris. I was studying in Paris for some time as an Erasmus student. When I moved to France I realised that my French was not good enough to follow the lectures at Grande Ecole. For that reason I first decided not to move in with the other Austrians into a shared flat because that doesn’t force you to speak French. Instead, I shared a flat with a French woman. Most of French people do not speak foreign languages, therefore I knew I would be forced to speak French. In the evening I watched the news on TV. During the day I read “Der Standard” and “Die Presse” and by doing that, it was much easier for me to understand the French news as I already knew the context of what was going on. Anyway it was tough as I didn’t understand a lot of words – so I was sitting in front of the TV strapped with a biro and a notebook, noting down all the words I didn’t understand and looking them up in a dictionary at the same time. Of course, I missed a lot of words and had to realize that I’m not good with that kind of multitasking. The interesting thing was that I discovered that more than half of the international students improved their French in the same way. When I came back to Austria I didn’t think about that anymore. Then in 2013, I was working on another TV project. In a brainstorming session, I thought about what else can you do with a TV and I remembered my time in Paris in 2003. I thought that today, with all the new technology available, we could improve on that way of learning a language. I stumbled over a research study from Kaplan International, which discovered that 82 per cent of those who learn English as a foreign language, use the TV. I did it myself with French, international students in Paris did it too, we could improve that. The idea of the uugot.it was born then. It’s absolutely amazing that you held onto this idea and developed it when the technology came about. Yes, but the story continues. Afterwards I didn’t use my French anymore as in Finance and at Deloitte one only needs English. As a result, I lost a lot of French. I tried to catch on with songs but without subtitles, it was hard to stay focused on it. Same with English. Then I saw Netflix with the subtitles and, as we had a very basic demo, I tried to click on them but nothing happened. I thought that I would like to make my idea happen. And it wasn’t only me, who was struggling. In 2015, the wave of refugees arrived. We realised very quickly that TV is the mirror of society and if people watch local TV, they get to know what that society is like. They learn about traditions and customs. It was also a driver for me in France, when choosing to watch local channels – I wanted to know what challenges the local people faced and what happens in Bordeaux or Montpellier… I also found out that the integration courses in Austria are actually only eight hours. You can’t help people feel comfortable in a completely new culture in just eight hours. It’s a good start but it’s not enough. With a companion like uugot.it, when people can watch the local television, we tear down the language barrier, it’s easier to catch up with society. You mentioned that completing your team took quite a long time. Why was that? Did you have a very clear vision of who you were looking for? It was really important to find the right people to become crucial team members. You asked me before if I have a technical background. I don’t and it was mandatory to find someone who does. We also needed a linguist and someone specialising in didactics. So these were the key positions I was looking out to fill. It was very hard to find the right person for the chief technology officer (CTO) position – during the whole project, we’ve actually had a couple of different CTOs. And it’s tough if you don’t have money to pay people. I mean they lose confidence if you’re invited to present at business agencies and you are in the final jury hearing and finally you get negative feedback. The judges would say it’s a good idea but they wouldn’t believe in the method actually working. This is something we heard a lot and at some point, I decided that we needed research, academic research, to support our concept with, for example, the University of Vienna, and actually conducted one. Another feedback we heard was that people couldn’t imagine how uugot.it worked. So we’ve built a very simple demo that people could actually try out and see it. This took some time because I was still looking for the right people to work with. Either I had to discover that people do not have the required skills or didn’t fit in the team and our mission: h1elping to improve the integration process. I think most of the start-ups have these challenges, that the original founders split up because of disagreements. We had someone on the team, who wasn’t a good match. I realized that too late and, at that time, I was not the CEO of the company. So from the perspective of building your team for a project, especially technology-based project like uugot.it, how do you, as a start-up owner, make sure that this external feedback doesn’t put your team down? That’s a good question! It’s not easy to say what the right way is. I mean, I was kind of frustrated that I needed so many technical co-founders, people who were responsible for technical features and in the beginning, I couldn’t judge people’s abilities to build uugot.it, I didn’t have the insight I have today. And of course, what we developed was not an easy thing to build and we needed expertise from several different fields but didn’t have the budget nor the influence to have experts advise us. We needed to take this process, to build this team we have now in small steps, and eventually rearrange the team. One thing I think is really necessary for team building… When I studied I worked full-time, also beforehand, when I was doing my matura, so I didn’t have regular student life. I didn’t build my network because I was busy. So when I saw other founders, I was kind of jealous that these people “grew up” together, sometimes went to school together and formed their teams. They had deep relationships and “trust” in each other. And I think this is one of the most important things within the team, that you can trust each other. That you know that the other people are also committed 100 per cent and more – and I would not recommend to hire a consultant for your team. This never works. Speaking of trust, you mentioned earlier that one of the repetitive comments you received was questioning the viability of your method of teaching languages. How did you organise the research? This was actually quite simple. We received feedback that the method doesn’t seem right and I said, “Ok, let’s find out”. We researched how to fund a study. Then my first CTO recommended me to contact FFG Innovationsscheck and with the funding received from them, we financed the first study. We asked the University of Vienna, the Department of German Studies to do it, and wanted to get an answer to a very specific question, namely “Are subtitles an appropriate tool for learning foreign languages?”. Professor Dr Boeckmann, who led the study, conducted a meta-study, which comprised of about 50 different studies and the feedback was amazing. Results from 43 studies concluded that subtitles led to boosted foreign language learning. We also showed the researchers our concept and they agreed that interactive subtitles are the right way. They also helped us to improve our concept! Let’s talk about your application. How does it differ from other learning apps on the market? We do not see ourselves so much as a language learning tool even though we are connected to that as well. We see ourselves as a streaming tool – you can stream daily broadcasts and what we do is add interactive same language subtitles, intralingual subtitles, so German broadcast will be equipped with German interactive subtitles. The subtitles are generated by our translation algorithms, based on existing machine translation engines. How it works is when you don’t understand a word you click on it and the word will be translated in that very second. At the same time, each word you click on will be stored within the language learning section. You learn a language using uugot.it but for us, the focus is on the users getting information – you do something you like, watch a broadcast you like and you learn the words you don’t understand in a subconscious way – together with the message. And this helps you understanding Austrian peculiarities. What’s the status of the app right now? It’s usable but not rolled out for general use yet. We only did pilot phases, so far with over 650 people. We have been involved with Austrian educational institutions from a very early stage on, such as VHS Linz and VHS Wien, as well as three universities in Latin America, which already use uugot.it in German language learning. I’m very proud to say that Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the biggest university of Mexico but also the 4th university in terms of reputation in Latin America, is using uugot.it in their language learning courses. How did you establish these partnerships? I have been invited to be a speaker at different national and international conferences, German as foreign language conferences, which is how I made these connections. In terms of VHS Linz that was a bit different – we were part of a project, an incubator programme, which had selected people or firms from Upper Austria to help one start-up get more exposure. In our case, the office of the mayor of Linz discovered us and during a photo shoot, we got to show the first prototype to the mayor, who was very impressed with uugot.it. When I mentioned us doing a field test in a couple of months, he suggested to do it in Linz. Within two months we established a close relationship with the city of Linz and this led to other opportunities. Fast forward to today: where are you now with your start-up? We are in the seed stage. We have our first clients, for example, we have equipped Wissensturm in Linz with uugot.it. We have some announcements coming up in July with a press conference then we will roll out uugot.it. Many thanks for your time and sharing your start-up story!

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/09/27/migration-winedown/","ImpactHub","WineDown: Inclusive Societies and Migration – Impact Hub Vienna","Since 2015, Austrian society has been learning to coexist with an influx of migrants, and although there has always been a mixture of ethnicities, religions, genders, races, and nationalities in the city, the 2015 crisis threw a spotlight on what it meant to try and become a more inclusive society. But the evolution has been bumpy, to say the least. It’s left a lot of social entrepreneurs questioning whether or not innovative business ideas are capable of helping to better include marginalized communities, or if our society is doomed to become more siloed and biased. Last month at Impact Hub Vienna, we invited a panel of social entrepreneurs to speak at WineDown: Inclusive Societies. We looked at two often marginalized communities, women and migrants, and explored how the attitudes towards them have evolved. Each panelist had a unique perspective on what (if anything) had actually improved over the years, whether or not startups in Vienna can be successful in building a more inclusive society, and why our communities seem to be becoming more biased. The founders shaping a more inclusive society The founders on our panel had a variety of different experiences with the marginalized groups. All panelists were female entrepreneurs, and two of them were migrants themselves having come to Austria from Eastern European countries. They were also in different stages of growing their businesses, some later-stage founders and some just starting out. Additionally, each social business focused on supporting migrants and/or women in some way. Based on their unique backgrounds, personal experiences, and individual perspectives, here are a few of the insights they had to share: Annamaria Tolvaly, founder of Bags with Legs: “With the right support, migrant women can be empowered and grow.” Annamaria Tolvaly, founder of the atelier and shop Bags with Legs and a migrant herself, believes that we need to change the narrative we have surrounding migrants and in particular, migrant women. “I grew up in communism in a system where you had to use your own hands to create something. I use the knowledge passed down from my grandmother today in my business. I work with talented and skilled women from Syria and Afghanistan who went through unbelievable [challenges] and are here to learn. They don’t want to just stay at home. That narrative our society gives to migrant women doesn’t reflect them, and we need to change it. We need to show that refugee and migrant women coming from different cultures can adapt very quickly to this dynamic environment.” When asked if social entrepreneurship had the potential to change this perception, Tolvaly responded, “Yes, there is still so much to do. My job as a social entrepreneur is to do my work and create a new energy and attitude toward women with a migrant background.” Andra Weiss (Slaats), founder of Younited Cultures: “ It is time to engage the public and corporates more.” Andra Weiss (Slaats) is the founder of Younited Cultures, a fashion brand that highlights positive aspects of migration by telling migrants’ stories. During the panel, Andra Weiss (Slaats) argued that we as a society have the wrong perception of migration, which she considers to be an inevitable social phenomenon. She remarked, “It is worrisome to note that we are still discussing migration as a negative trend. Refugees and migrants are mostly young people who will invest in the economy. Journalists and the media play a major role in driving negative perceptions around migration.” She argued that social entrepreneurs can improve the lives of the migrants we support and can spread a positive message within that bubble, but there are sectors of society who simply aren’t open to changing their perception. “They aren’t willing to have a dialogue.” Katha Schinkinger, partner at Habibi & Hawara: Katha Schinkinger, another of the panelists, is a partner at Habibi & Hawara. Habibi & Hawara, a restaurant and catering service whose employees are refugees and migrants. In addition to employment, they also have the opportunity to acquire professional training which can be useful once they become independent entrepreneurs themselves. When responding to whether or not she believed that social businesses could be part of changing the perceptions around migrants she said, “We never thought that a little girl from Sweden could change the narrative of the climate crisis. Young people are deeply interested in politics, and they are pissed off. We need to empower them. It is hard, but we need to keep fighting for it.” Recognizing our own bias to foster deeper conversation During the event, our panelists often recognized the very liberal bubble that social entrepreneurs live in and the difficulty of changing perceptions outside that bubble. Francis Rafal, an entrepreneur who is currently running a variety of different ventures, shared an exercise with the audience to help them understand their personal bias and break their filter bubbles. He asked the audience to answer questions anonymously using their mobile device. He asked, “How biased are you compared to the average Austrian?” The result of this brief survey showed that just over 10% of respondents considered themselves to be more biased, 40% of people considered themselves equally willing or less biased and willing to express their affection based on their own opinion compared to the average Austrian. Those opinions are formed based on their experiences of the world, and we need to be open to hearing all sides of the conversation. Based on these results, as well as other indicators confirming such results, Rafal concluded. “Become aware of your bias, audit your environment and think of the five people you spend the most time with. Those people influence you the most. In the end, make active contact with people outside your own filter bubble because everybody wants to be loved and appreciated. If you listen to other people, they might also open their ears to you.” Want to be a part of future events at Impact Hub Vienna where we discuss topics like migration, social inclusions, and other challenges within our society?

Tackling the Difficult Problem of Single-Use Plastic Takeaway Packaging","You finally reach your flat after a full day, and the last thing you want to do is to cook. So you order your food online, the same way you have done many times before. It arrives in plastic, with plastic condiment packets, and wrapped in a plastic bag. Your stomach is happy, you are happy, our planet… not necessarily. Disposable food packaging used traditionally in restaurants, fast food chains and in the catering industry is usually made of inexpensive polystyrene or plastic. Both materials are able to safely contain food for transportation, don’t grow mould or bacteria, and have reasonable insulating properties. On the other hand, take away food packaging is supposed to be cheap and single-use, therefore it’s produced in such way that reusability is out of the question, and the resources spent on manufacturing such packaging are not worth recovering. The same packaging is also impossible to degrade naturally and remains in the environment for generations. As a result, we have produced literal tonnes of the stuff, and we cannot get rid of it. In March, the European Parliament approved a new law within the framework of A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy which bans single-use plastic items such as plates, cutlery, straws, food containers and expanded polystyrene cups by 2021 in an effort to tackle plastic pollution globally. What does the plastic-free future of takeaway food look like? Global plastic pollution According to the EU Commission, global production of plastics has increased twentyfold since the 1960s, reaching 322 million tonnes in 2015. It is expected to double again over the next 20 years. As of 2015, only 9% of plastic waste produced to date is recycled, 12% is incinerated, and 79% accumulates in landfills or the natural environment as litter (source). Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean (source) on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments – “60 % coming from uncollected waste or litter from land-based sources, 20 % from collected plastic waste subsequently leaking into the ocean environment, and 20 % from ocean-based sources such as fisheries” (source). On European beaches alone, plastics make up 80–85 % of marine litter, half of which is single-use plastics (source). Plastic takes more than 400 years to degrade (source), so most of it still exists in some form, such as microplastic. Polystyrene and plastic food packaging alike break down into smaller parts and enter digestive systems of land and water animals, either leading to their death or eventually returning to us in the tap water, in salt and beer, and even in the air we breathe. The effects of microplastics on human health are not yet discovered. But what about recycling? 2025 million takeaway containers per year are used in the European Union (EU) alone – if recycled, disposable takeaway containers could help reduce equivalent greenhouse gas emissions generated annually by 55,000 cars (source). However, takeaway food recycling faces many obstacles. Only 25% of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) used for food packaging in the EU (around 335 000 tonnes per year) is recycled; 30% is incinerated while the rest ends up in landfills (source). The main hurdles are sanitation of polystyrene packaging, which often comes contaminated with greasy food residues. In terms of purely plastic packaging, the Austrian recycling system doesn’t collect it – your “yellow bin” waste is supposed to be made up of plastic bottles and tetrapacks only. In countries such as Austria, where waste-to-energy plants became one of the links in the waste management chain, single-use plastic will travel to incinerators together with the rest of your household waste and burn to ash. However, in many other countries, single-use plastic traveling to landfills or unregulated dumpsites is a common procedure – in this case, plastic will either rot away in piles of thrash for thousands of years or leak into the marine environment. One of the ideas to combat the plastic waste generated by single-use takeaway packaging is to replace the throwaway boxes with reusable containers. Reusable food containers In Austria, around 900,000 tonnes of plastic waste accumulates annually, around a third of which is currently being recycled. Around 300,000 tonnes are packaging waste (source). “The idea for RePhil was born during a course at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. At our campus, there are more than 300 single-use takeaway packages consumed every day. We saw them lying around campus, the bins bursting with them and thought that there must be an alternative to all this waste that is created by takeaway packaging,’ starts the story Hannah Wundsam, one of the founders of RePhil. ‘We discussed why people do not just bring their own reusable boxes to the restaurants, and quickly learned that takeaway is mainly a question of convenience. Even though customers are bothered by the waste they create, it would be too great of an effort to bring their own containers, to wash them and constantly carry them around. When we talked about the topic in the hallway a student approached us, telling us that he overheard our conversation and that he is writing his bachelor thesis about single-use takeaway packaging on campus. The restaurants around the university approached the campus management to ask them for an alternative solution, and Professor Groschopf took the initiative to research about the amount of waste stemming from the takeaway at the campus and what kind of alternatives are out there. This is when we chose to work on a solution that will allow for the convenience of takeaway as we know it, but reduces plastic waste and plastic pollution.’ The team is made of up four members with versatile skills and experience: Cornelia Sochor and Hannah are master students from the Vienna University of Economics and Business and came up with the idea for RePhil during a course of their program “SIMC – Strategy Innovation and Management Control”. They both have work experience in banking, accounting, strategy, and sales. Xaver is a PhD student at the Technical University of Vienna and is responsible for the technology side of the business. Last but not least, Karin, a student at the University of Applied Arts of Vienna studying product design, is responsible for visual branding. The RePhil containers are made of polypropylene and can be reused up to 300 times – after only the 7th reuse, they are more CO2 efficient than single-use containers. But the circularity of the solution doesn’t end there – broken containers will be recycled and made into toys. Encouraging consumers to bring reusable containers to their favourite takeaway spots is nothing new. However, encouraging the restaurants to invest money and resources into providing reusable takeaway containers is a much more difficult feat. This is why RePhil wants to make it more convenient for both consumers and restaurants to drop off the containers and re-distribute them back to the network of partners in Vienna, increasing the convenience and attractiveness of the offer. ‘After having finished their meals, costumers return the empty reusable boxes in our strategically positioned drop-off stations. RePhil collects the dirty boxes, washes them and reallocates them back to the restaurant,’ explains Hannah. Currently entering the first market test, RePhil’s aspirations run high with the desire to replace all single-use packaging in the takeaway and food delivery market in Austria. And we really hope that their dream becomes a reality! Find out how to get involved as a restaurant, customer or a local company on the RePhil’s website.

We brought together investors, startups, executives, intermediaries, and policymakers to explore how each of us in our roles can contribute solutions to some of the world’s current challenges. Most importantly, we kicked off new collaborations and generated ideas to help these solutions truly scale. Here’s a recap of some of the highlights from Impact Days 2019. The day in numbers: 330+ people participated in the conference 3 separate tracks were hosted for deep learning and connection building 20+ countries were represented 25 impact ventures presented their story and work Here were a few key messages from the conference that inspired us: Charly Kleissner (Co-Founder Toniic & KL Felicitas Foundation; Board Chair ImpactAssets)Systems change only under pressure – we can’t predict when the change will happen but we know it will happen. This system doesn’t serve the population anymore. We can be victims or co-creators. I say we will be co-creators. David de Rothschild (Environmentalist and Explorer, Founder Lost Explorer and the Sculpt the Future Foundation)We need to start thinking about innovation. And not from the perspective that we need to design a new app. If you are an innovator you are a creative problem solver. The problems that we face today cannot be solved by politicians. Dr. Rüdiger Fox (CEO, Sympatex Technologies)Every change, especially a dramatic one, needs a lot of time. SDGs are nothing more than global goals for the global economy. A call to action We’ll borrow a few words from Katherine Milligan, (Head of Gender & Diversity, Bamboo Capital Partners) to close: “Talk was great, but now it’s time for action.” It is time to leverage your personal sphere of influence to scale social impact. How can you change your decision making in your personal and professional life to contribute to building a more inclusive, sustainable world? Which SDG can you impact and how can you support it? We hope that you’re asking yourself these tough questions. We hope you have the audacity to challenge the status quo and start scaling impact.

This inflatable device is designed to lift them if they fall and cannot stand up on their own. We talked with Andreas Braun about this startup. How did you come up with the idea for this tool? We did our civil service as paramedics at the Red Cross in Vienna. After a short time, we noticed that many older people fall down on the floor and they are not injured at all but just too weak to get up. Even if they live with a partner, the other person may not have the strength to lift them. So, what do they do? The classic scenario is that they call an ambulance. So, for example, the paramedics get a call, we drive through Vienna, and meet a husband who says, “my wife is lying down on the floor.” We pick her up, conduct a health check, and it only takes five seconds. Then we have to fill out a lot of papers and they pay 36 euros for assistance. And this happens, on average, once or twice a day for a paramedic team during an 8-12 hour shift. In one extreme scenario, a woman called us three times in one day! She just kept falling down. She was not injured, but she simply could not get up alone. And so we had an idea: maybe she needs a personal device that would help her to get up. And if a person is alone, can he or she use such a device? Yes. But the device should be close by. Otherwise, a person on the floor needs a partner to bring the device. Usually, the people who fall down are able to crawl or roll a bit. So the basic principle of our device is that when you fall down, a partner (who must be mobile) can bring you the device and roll it out for you. This process is easy enough that a physically impaired person can do this. Therefore, in this situation, no ambulance is needed. You roll to a flat mattress and the mattress fills up with air and expands to chair. When the problem is solved, the air gets removed from the device and its owner can fold it back and store it. We called our tool “LuftLift.” So it should have some button and work from some electric energy source? Yes, just one button up and down and a small air pump with batteries included and a remote control. Sounds like you have done some product development. What stage are you in now? We received our prototype (after a long long wait) on Monday, the 8th of October. After that, we will test two prototypes with different designs and also redefine our current prototype. At the moment we are using a pump produced by another company, but in the future, we will develop our own control unit for the up and down functions. We want to make our own because it should have several layers of caution that should be controlled separately. You can watch a video of our first tests, with an air mattress and a person lying on it. That’s our teammate actually on the video! As you can see, it’s just a normal mattress from a store, but in reality, it will lift much higher and will have hip support. Who will produce these gadgets? Our production partner is No Problaim. Normally, they make inflatable devices for other companies. For us, it will be custom made. As of January of this year, we have been participating in a program called AWS-first (more info here) which provides Workshops, Mentoring, expertise, and funding for us. How is Impact Hub Vienna supporting your project? We are members of Impact Hub Vienna, and the network gives us a lot of connections. We connect with other actors in the industry and other startups. We are all gathering under one common umbrella, so we can profit from one another. Who are you currently working with on this project? Right now we are in close cooperation with Red Cross, Caritas and other organizations that provide assistance to older people. They are quite interested in this product because many nurses have orthopedic problems due to the fact that they are lifting up people all the time. They already have machines that move people from bed to bed, but our project is the first one to offer a device to lift people from the floor. So we take our prototype, go to them, get the feedback and develop the device following their advice. We will continue working on the prototype until the moment they tell us that it is a viable product for what they need. We don’t have a specific deadline for this project, our focus is really to make it properly. Do you have a business plan and what will be the estimated price of «LuftLift»? Our goal is to sell one unit for about 500 euros, which includes a very slim profit margin. We would like to make it as cheap as possible, and the final price will depend on the number of devices being produced. What do you see in the future for your startup? Right now we are a group of four students, and we have not yet started any company, officially. It’s really our hobby because we’re also in university and have other projects going on. Of course, we are thinking about it, but we can not say how exactly we will develop the project in the future. We don’t know if we will go hard in the private sector. We want to check out our prototype and approach potential customers to see where the biggest need is. For example, if the nursing homes say they need it, it will be a focus.

To this end, the project welcomes EU-based startups with a product or prototype, with established founding teams or wishing to become engaged in product teams or wishing to become engaged in product field-testing. A selection of top 20-25 startups will be involved in a one-week bootcamp, where they will learn about business model innovation, startup methodologies and tools, get additional product validation, define the value proposition and prepare a business case which will be pitched to project representatives. The bootcamp is a competitive arena where only the brilliant and creative ideas will survive to the second stage. The best 5-10 startups, selected from Phase 1, will be invited to a highly intensive 3-month follow-up acceleration program to detail the technical solutions and business model that will make their transport poverty solution viable. During this period, entrepreneurs will be offered the chance to use an open toolbox developed by HiReach and gain a competitive advantage for accelerating novel mobility products. The best 5 startups, selected from Phase 2, will meet and network with decision-makers, consultants, customers, investors and industry operators to test-bed their ideas under real-life conditions, providing unprecedented international recognition and a fast-track to entering a huge untapped market. Impact Hub Vienna is the accelerator and will have the opportunity to impact the future of transportation, managing both a one-week bootcamp and 3 months acceleration program.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/12/09/have-a-very-sustainable-christmas/","ImpactHub","Have a very sustainable Christmas! How to make your Christmas celebrations eco-friendly and ethical in 2019"," It is impossible to think about Christmas in other terms than the times of opulence – we sometimes spend exorbitant sums of money on gifts, cook plenty of food, which often goes to waste, decorate our houses or flats with strings of fairy lights and plastic decor. The world does not let us forget that to celebrate Christmas is to eat, drink and be merry (and don’t hide your wallet). However, in the year 2019, can we ever lose sight of the climate catastrophe playing out in the background? Hey, it’s me, the ghost of sensible Christmas! I came here to remind you that in 2019 eco-anxiety and ecological grief creeped into people’s lives as the news of the effects of anthropogenic activities on our planet tumble in every day mercilessly. At the Hub we will find ourselves huddling over lunch talking about our worries and potential solutions. New innovative ventures come to Impact Hub with ideas addressing renewable energy and energy efficiency, environmental and social impact in Vienna, biodiversity, and literally every other concept advancing the global agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals. Yeah, the situation is dire. However, and I cannot stress this enough, you are the change maker, the impact bringer, the lovely Hubby creature, that knows that individual action means empowerment and that, in our community, individual action causes wide ripples. PS. If I had inadvertently rained on your parade, here are some tips on how to manage climate anxiety from a very smart person, Gillian Caldwell, in her blog “Coming out of the closet: My climate trauma (and yours?)“. Back to the matter at hand – Christmas! This year we shall make that extra effort and bring back the true spirit of Christmas in face of unrolling climate crisis – the spirit of unity with all beings, empathy, kindness and ethical living. We not only speak of sharing, reflecting and purely enjoying this magical time, but also about minimizing your waste, giving back to the society, and letting your credit card have a break. I searched far and wide to bring you the best ideas for not only sustainable but also ethical and eco-friendly Christmas, that you can implement in 2019 straight away! Opt-out of the Unnecessary Gift Shopping Frenzy I am probably a little bit late with this call to arms as the smoke billows over the virtual field of the battle of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, repeating this never gets old: buying should be the last resort. As the famous Buyerarchy of Needs by Sarah Lazarovic nicely visualises, there are many other ways to satisfy your needs. So what sustainable gifts can you magic up? Instead of going loco and worrying about gifting each person you know, collect a group of friends and family and organize Secret Santa. This way each person will give and receive one gift, which means everybody will be happy and you won’t be paying off loans long after Christmas. You can use this website to organize the participants’ list, set the budget and assign names. Make the gifts yourself. Have you been to Pinterest recently? Search DIY gifts and be amazed. Give time. Instead of buying presents, do something with people you care about. For example, go on a Shades Tour together. Why not combine a family outing with volunteering at a local charity? Ask for donations. If you have that family member, who will just not let go of the idea of giving you something (and the experience tells that you will not be happy about that something), ask them to donate to a charity of your choice. Shop preloved goods. Visit Humana or MA48 Tandler store, peruse Willhaben, Shpock, Facebook marketplace or ebay.at. Organize a Christmas gift swap for those, who prefer to not spend money. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. When you still want to buy a brand-new gift, support your local business. Buy gifts from local artisan companies, visit craft markets or support your creative friends’ businesses. If you are part of the Impact Hub Vienna network, tap into the community and ask them what they offer. They are many valid reasons you should be supporting SMBs with your wallet – they pay back into the community and, in comparison to international corporations, are much better in supporting local economy and making social impact happen. Give a gift that keeps on giving. For example: sponsor a meal for a child or seeds for a farmer through Caritas.at; prepare a clothes repair kit with threads, needles, scissors and similar to keep clothes in a good condition for longer; gift a voucher to a workshop from, for example, Zero Waste Austria or Bubbles and Kraut (co-owned by Impact Hub Vienna’s recurring design magician, Jo); gift a potted indoor plant; gift a library card or a yearly museum entry ticket; adopt an olive tree in Italy or a coffee tree (this one comes from Anna Arató from Impact Hub Global) – simply search online to find out how; adopt an animal through Caritas.at; or buy a wooden worm box for the green thumb in your circle. Ran out of time and will have to hit the high-street? Educate yourself beforehand – many of the popular brands we see daily are causing environmental harm and do not take care of the people powering their supply chain. Ethical Consumer and Konsument.at keep tabs on brands we should avoid and brands that do good things. Opt for battery-free gifts if possible. In the US the sales of batteries go up 40% in the holiday season. Batteries, made of toxic and non-degradable chemicals, often end up in landfill and pollute soil and water, not to mention poisoning animals. Re-gifting is okay. No, really. No, there isn’t a special ring in Hell reserved for those of you, who dare to pass an unwanted gift on. Ditch buying new rolls of wrapping paper. Use your paper waste (calendars, posters, maps etc), pieces of fabric, scarves, or glass jars instead. Recently I was in Tokyo – instead of buying wrapping paper, I bought a daily newspaper and used it to wrap and decorate the gifts I bought for my family. Save wrapping paper for the future! Not only the wrapping paper from your gifts – ask everybody in your family to make a pile of wrapping paper and stash it in a cupboard for other gift-wrapping opportunities. To make it easy to reuse wrapping paper, avoid sticky tape and replace it with strings of paper, thread or ribbons. Eco-friendly Christmas Cards Go paperless! Send a free Christmas e-card from websites such as Some e-cards, Blue Mountain or Jib Jab or record a video of yourself wishing your family and friends merry times. Alternatively, if you feel creative, design your own e-card in Canva. Still prefer to send? If you are not convinced by electronic Christmas cards (you have to admit that ‘elfing yourself‘ is pretty awesome) how about making your own Christmas cards from old magazines, wrapping paper, newspapers or…last year’s Christmas cards? Okay, you are dead set on sending Christmas cards. Check out your local charities to see if they sell Christmas cards. By purchasing cards from them you support social causes and give back to the community. In Austria there is for example Unicef at, which offers a wide selection of Weihnachtskarten, as well as SOS-Kinderdorf. Preventing Food Waste & Sustainable Christmas In Europe alone around 88 million tonnes of food is wasted annually, which has an associated cost estimated at 143 billion euros (data from 2016, read the report here). According to a 2019 IPCC land use report, between 25 and 30 % of the food produced worldwide is wasted. Food production is actively contributing to the changes in our climate. That pestering thought that Christmas cannot be enjoyed until the table is overflowing with food? Kill it. “Perhaps one of the most important reasons for food waste at the consumption level in rich countries is that people simply can afford to waste food,” reads FAO’s 2011 “Global food losses and food waste: Extent, causes and prevention” publication. In countries such as Austria, we are spoiled for choice and it makes us equally relaxed about the food we waste. It’s time to change our thinking! (Pst! I have written another article on the food waste in Austria, which you should check out.) Go meatless and/or dairy-free. Even a small change in your menu, which incorporates more plant food and fewer calories from animal products, could significantly contribute to agriculture’s pressure on the environment. There are plenty of delicious meat-free and dairy-free recipes for you to try out! Plan your menu in advance and make a shopping list. Planning what exactly you need to buy will prevent over-buying as shopping behaviour and retail environment have direct links to food waste. While you are in a planning mode, search for versatile recipes for food leftovers too. Love Food Hate Waste has plenty useful tools and tips on how to prevent food waste. Do not overbuy on products, which can go to waste quickly and make sure you store perishables correctly. This fantastic infographic will turn you into the next Martha Stewart. Cut down on packaged food. Here in Vienna, we have many fresh markets, where you can get plastic-free meat, fruit and vegetables. If you make too much food, freeze it or organize a potluck dinner with your neighbors. You can also ask your guests to bring food containers to take lefotver food home. Prepare big portions of mulled wine, punsch, hot chocolate or eggnog instead of buying cans or bottles of soft drinks. Be creative with your organic waste. Keep carrot and parsnip tops, broccoli stalks, potato peels, onion and garlic skins, bones, mix them in a bag, freeze and use as a basis for meat/vegetable stock. Add orange and lemon skins to white vinegar to create a naturally scented cleaning product. Compost the rest. Questions? Ask Pinterest. The Christmas Tree Debate: Plastic vs. Real. Even though plastic trees can be reused each year, their production, storage and transport use up non-renewable resources. Also, an artificial Christmas tree would need to be used for around 10 years for its environmental impact to be lower than real trees, says the Carbon Trust. Let’s be honest: it isn’t rare for plastic Christmas trees to be discarded due to repeated dismantling making them look unattractive, which results in more plastic polluting landfill because, how do I put it, plastic never degrades. If you can, buy a living tree. You can either get one small enough to be kept in a pot for a long time or get one you can replant in your garden. If you do not want to keep your tree after the Christmas season, drop it off at one of the recycling spots in Vienna. Make sure you read up on how to take care of your new green friend! Think of other alternatives. Does it have to be an actual tree? How about a tall pile of books wrapped in fairy lights or a wall decoration made with nails and a string? How about that overgrown house plant? Green Christmas Decorations Skip on the excessive outdoor light installations this year. You will pay less (whether in electricity bill or batteries purchases) and use less of the non-renewable energy. Buy LED fairy lights, which use 90% less energy than the traditional holiday bulbs. Decorate your garden trees with bird feed decorations. How cute are these?! Candles are much more sustainable sources of a warm glow indoors. Not to mention the atmosphere. Turn off the Christmas lights at night. Honestly, if everybody is sleeping, who will be admiring this magical show? Make your own Christmas tree and house decorations. Use dried plants, cinnamon sticks, pinecones, straw, branches of pine trees, paper and ribbons. How about dried orange slices with cloves hanging around the house? Beautiful aroma and pretty ornaments – checked! Gingerbread makes for awesome Christmas tree oraments. Check out this recipe. I hope that this list will give you some tips on how to make the 2019 Christmas season not only festive and filled with kindness, but also greener, eco-friendlier and not harmful to our beautiful planet.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/02/why-transport-poverty-is-an-issue-of-social-exclusion/","ImpactHub","Why Transport Poverty is an Issue of Social Exclusion","I come from a small village in the south of Poland, which does not have public transport. It also doesn’t have local government-funded transport connections to the bigger cities in a travelling distance. A private network of minivans, the only mode of transportation for those without a car, goes back and forth between Cracow and my home village, often filled to the brim with people. Imagine being squeezed into an overcrowded bus for almost 2 hours during peak times Monday to Friday and you will get the idea. The lack of reliable mode of transportation meant up to 3 hours of commute per day, five times per week, during my school years and being forced to pass up interesting job opportunities as the work schedule wouldn’t allow me to get to the bus stop in time to catch the last ride home. Eventually, in pursuit of education and a better future, I had to move. As the rapid urbanisation trend continues to climb worldwide – by 2050, 83.7% of people in Europe are projected to live in urban areas (European Commission) – more and more people are hit by the phenomenon called “transport poverty”. Countries are not developing urban and urban-adjacent areas fast enough to accommodate the influx and transit needs of the inhabitants, which leaves many people not being able to benefit from a better infrastructure. This problematic urbanisation by-product is not only a serious hindrance to the continuous economic growth – it’s also a major inequality and social disadvantage problem. Particularly affected are the vulnerable groups such as people with reduced mobility, children, younger and older generations, women, migrants and ethnic minorities, and citizens affected by low income or unemployment. What is Transport Poverty? At the time of writing this article there is no standarised definition of transport poverty. According to the Finnish Transport Research Centre Verne at the Tampere University, transport poverty can be defined as “phenomenon that consists of four concepts: mobility poverty, transport affordability, accessibility poverty and exposure to transport externalities.” This description has to be further elaborated on in terms of macro-scale factors (for example, the cost of car ownership or physical location) and micro-scale factors, such as the size of a household, income, street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety (Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice). HiReach, a three-year EU-funded Horizon 2020 project that focuses on the development of new tools and business models to improve accessibility for local areas and communities in need, compiled a list of mobile poverty qualifying components. An individual is transport poor if at least one of the following conditions cannot be fulfilled as they try to satisfy their daily basic activity need: Availability – No suitable transport option available Accessibility – Transport options do not reach destinations and opportunities Affordability – High cost burden Time budget – Excessive amount of time in travel Adequacy – Travel conditions are dangerous, unsafe or unhealthy for the individual Social Effects of Mobile Poverty In itself, transport poverty is a significant obstacle to the fulfillment of basic needs. Lack of suitable transportation means cutting off access to decent job opportunities, education, advanced health assistance and basic amenities available to city dwellers. Transport poverty also perpetuates poverty. For example, low mobility opportunities combined with the requirement to own a car gave rise to the phenomenon known as “Forced Car Ownership’ (FCO)”, which describes a situation in which an individual or a group spends a large chunk of the household budget on the purchase and operation of a car despite also reporting financial difficulties (Household car adoption and financial distress in deprived urban communities: A case of forced car ownership?). The underlying problem with FCO is that many people have to secure a mode of transportation to commute to work in an attempt to improve the financial situation and simultaneously bear the burden of spending large amounts of money on the vehicle as motoring costs increase every year. Transport poverty is a serious concern because it’s existence signals that we are not on the path to achieving equality and sustainability for all. Transportation system and accessibility are referenced as one of the key conditions required for the fulfilment of a wide variety of SDG’s progress milestones (Analysis of the Transport Relevance of Each of the 17 SDGs Report). Social benefits of accessible and convenient transport are explicitly covered by goal number 11- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, through the 11.2 target: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons (SDG Knowledge Platform). Source: SloCaTTransport-related social exclusion is highly individual-specific and takes on different forms as people, particularly the vulnerable groups, struggle to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Women in rural areas are more affected by time-constraints than their city counterparts, while women living in dense urban areas will have their transport decision heavily influenced by the question of safety of their respective neighbourhoods. The elderly or people with disabilities will weigh accessibility and comfort against the number of trips they are forced to make, even if the government waives their bus ticket fees. Further considerations have to be made in terms of income status, which directly influences access to potential mobility solutions, digital savviness or transit access. When any member of our society cannot rely on an affordable and convenient mode of transportation, we cannot talk about achieving inclusive societies. Can We Solve the Issue of Transport Poverty? In the spirit of Impact Hub Vienna, I say: Yes, we can! Transport poverty is not only a social problem, but also a market opportunity for new mobility solutions to reduce time and cost, or even trigger new mobility needs. It’s an avenue of opportunity for innovative transportation startups, which are working on business models that cater to the needs of the most affected disadvantaged groups. The HiReach Startup Lab is an Accelerator Program, which launched in 2019 targeting start-ups, which create mobility solutions for vulnerable groups. It’s part of the EU Project, HiReach. Find out more about the program here. HiReach reaches its last mile in 2020 and invites you to join the final virtual events, a series of two consecutive weeks appointments during which you will find out more about the startups, as well as the program.

It should come as no surprise therefore that the concern for the well-being of the city dwellers was manifested in one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. SDG 11 calls for improvements in air quality, waste management and waste collection, convenient access to public transport and public spaces among other things. Even though Austria ranks among the most liveable countries (with its capital – Vienna – taking the top spot in the quality of living survey), there is a large number of startups and social enterprises that strive to make living in our country even greater than it already is. From recycling to renewable energy systems to enhancing community experience through various social initiatives, these seven companies are trying (and definitely succeeding) to make the world a better place. 1. Wurmkiste With the rising popularity of Zero Waste movement, people are trying to minimize the production of domestic refuse. While implementing more reusable items into your everyday life is already a pretty good contribution, how about all the food waste each household produces? Instead of just throwing it away, why not try to “recycle” the produce waste? David Witzender, the founder of Wurmkiste, had precisely that idea in mind. Having studied agriculture at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, he created his first worm composting bin – or worm box (Wurmkiste) – in 2012. The science behind the box is simple: you either purchase wood and create the box yourself or buy a ready made one, lay it with wet newspaper paper and fill the box with your “starter population” of worms (approximately 500 little crawlers). Give them time to adapt to their new home and start feeding them with food waste coming from your kitchen. The result – in just about 3 weeks the worms will produce humus which can then be used either in the garden or added to the soil for indoor plants for better growth. 2. Urban Gold Another company successfully contributing to the reduction of the waste footprint is Urban Gold. The company is like the King Midas of recyclers – they are able to turn the electronic waste, or e-waste, into pure gold (as well as some other precious metals such as copper, silver, nickel, platinum and palladium – which are usually found in electronic devices). Electronic waste from developed states tends to end up in landfills in Africa or India where it is then recycled by hand in appalling conditions. It is also one of the fastest growing waste streams worldwide and one of the most complicated to recycle. Urban Gold, located in the Styrian town of Leoben, makes the process of extracting rare and precious metals from electric and electronic devices more efficient and sustainable. 3. Green Energy Lab Austria Green Energy Lab is a research initiative for sustainable energy solutions and it is the country’s largest innovation laboratory for renewable energy. The Lab is part of the Austrian innovation campaign “Flagship Region Energy” (“Vorzeigeregion Energie”) of the Climate and Energy Fund. Its test markets spread across 4 Austrian regions – Vienna, Lower Austria, Burgenland and Styria – and it caters to over 5 million customers! Green Energy Lab brings over 100 partners from research, energy industry and the public sector together with the main energy suppliers of the federal regions in order to provide better energy solutions to the users. By 2025, the Lab expects a fivefold increase of the days with 100% renewable energy consumption in the four regions. One of the many projects designed by the Green Energy Lab supports the development of the so-called positive energy districts – urban neighbourhoods with annual net zero energy import and zero CO2 emissions which are simultaneously working towards a surplus production of renewable energy. Who wouldn’t love to live in a city which not only uses alternative energy but also produces its own! 4. Lenkerbande Bicycles are undoubtedly one of the most convenient and sustainable ways to move around a big city. Vienna is no exception to that. According to the Copenhaganize Index – the ranking f the most bicycle-friendly cities on the planet – Vienna currently is in the top 10 cities that has a lot to offer to its cyclists. However, bikes need maintenance. And that is where Lenkerbande comes in. Lenkerbande provides all kinds of bicycle-related services, much more than a regular bike shop has to offer. The people of Lenkerbande fix, recycle and even donate used bicycles in DIY workshops in Vienna. So, not only does Lenkerbande contribute to sustainable mobility, it also makes the means of that mobility sustainable by recycling and reusing old bicycles. In 2015, Lenkerbande started their IntegRadsion project. The project aims at helping newly arrived refugees familiarize themselves with their new surroundings. How? By cycling around their neighborhoods and districts. Lenkerbande collects and repairs donated used bicycles which are then given to the people from refugee backgrounds. 5. MONTREET Sportswear As you can probably tell by the name, MONTREET Sportswear is a clothing brand which produces wind and water-resistant jackets for various outdoor sports, such as climbing, cycling and jogging. The philosophy behind the brand is simple, as Nadine Schratzberger, the brand creator states: why would you do outdoor sports while wearing something that might harm the environment in the long run? All MONTREET jackets can be recycled and reused and, a bonus point, they are even made from recycled polyester! But there’s another thing that make MONTREET jackets special: they are made using the colorful designs by the Viennese artist BOICUT. 6. Shades Tours Shades Tours is a social enterprise which offers educational tours in the cities of Vienna and Graz with the purpose of explaining the many shades of homelessness as well as presenting the multiple Viennese institutions that altogether form the city’s social net. As the guides themselves have been exposed to homelessness, they are the experts on the matter. As of recently, Shades Tours Vienna also offers tours about refuge and integration, and drugs and addiction which are also guided by the affected people. Shades Tours not only gives a chance to have a glimpse into the world many people have never experienced, but also helps people (re)integrate back into society by providing them with a job. Perrine Schober, the founder of Shades Tours, sees the main purpose of her project in bringing the complexity of homelessness, addiction and seeking refuge closer to the tour participants and make them realize that these issues can affect anyone. 7. Frag Nebenan Living in a big city can sometime be quite lonely. You live in a populated apartment building but usually don’t even know who your neighbors are. Frag Nebenan tries to help you get to know the people that live nearby better. After all, you never know when you might need to borrow some salt or need help with finding your missing pet. Frag Nebenan offers a platform that connects residents from neighborhoods who usually wouldn’t have a chance to meet each other. These neighbors are often people from diverse backgrounds and lives, with different talents, interests and needs. The platform gives the residents of the same district or neighborhood an opportunity to self-organize and help each other with various issues, such as babysitting, lending household appliances or helping neighbors that are sick.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sustainable-Development-Goals-and-Social-Entrepreneurship-How-7-Austrian-Startups-Are-Making-the-Cities-Smarter-600x400.jpg","January 8, 2020","en",0.992930173873901,0.00793452223297209,0.861164540052414,0.0227637034549844,0.108137216418982
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/13/your-impact-hub-vienna-membership-guide/","ImpactHub","How to Make the Most out of Your Impact Hub Vienna Membership [ 2020 Update ]","As of January 2020, we are a network of over 100 Impact Hubs in 55+ countries all over the world – home to over 16,500 members! Nothing to sneeze at, if we say so ourselves. While we all exist under the umbrella of Impact Hub Global, each Impact Hub is a unique place with an offering tailored to the ecosystem in which it exists. Impact Hub Vienna is a diverse community of founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs, which has been growing and flourishing in our quirky space in the 7th district for the past 10 years! We say that at Impact Hub Vienna people innovate with heart, balancing social responsibility with profitability to build a world that works for all. We would like to think that every single one of you, our members, takes full advantage of the opportunities you have at your fingertips. If you are wondering in what ways you can utilise the locally rooted, globally connected Impact Hub network in 2020, our team prepared a Hubby guide to our membership services. Here we go! Ask and You Shall Receive Impact Hub Vienna is many things to many people. For starters, we are a co-working space in Vienna. We are an office for those who buy the FIXED DESK membership. We are something of a temporary stopover for ventures that become visiting members for the duration of our accelerator programs. AND we are also a physical event location in Vienna for both members and nonmembers. Whatever your situation, make sure you take advantage of all the perks of your membership and inform yourself about the available facilities and services that suit your particular needs. We also want you to let us know if things could improve – we are a home to over 600 members and it’s important to us that all of you are satisfied! Have a question about your membership package? Contact your account manager! Contact us online (scroll down to the contact form at the bottom of this page) or come up to the front desk on the ground floor. Alternatively, you can always ask questions and share suggestions in the Facebook group for members – our team will be happy to answer your questions! Be Part of the Community Being part of a community might just be the ticket to help you survive the next decade. When the news feed is all doom and gloom, when you find yourself experiencing climate anxiety, surround yourself with people who are working on making their social impact count. And there’s research that shows there are clear benefits to it! Embracing your community is good for your mental health because it satisfies your innate need to belong. And it considerably increases your quality of life! The longest study on happiness conducted by scientists at Harvard concluded that cultivating relationships is the sure way to lead a healthy and happy life. Without a community behind them, entrepreneurs can often feel like it’s ‘me against the world’. When we factor in the positive social or environmental focus on top of that, that leads industry professionals to view social entrepreneurs as lesser entrepreneurs due to the priority of creating impact over amassing financial wealth, the problem can grow exponentially. Impact Hub Stockholm There’s more good news. According to a Northwestern University study, sitting next to high achievers can increase people’s performance in various jobs by 3% to 16%. Scoot over, Hubbers! Discuss solutions or distract yourself, find a new project to put your energy into or share your worries over a cup of coffee. No longer you have to be isolated at home with your thoughts – you can co-work the pain away! The Hub creatures can become a sounding board and support system for you, offering advice or opinions when you need it – something that is often missing when you work alone on your plan to make the world a better place to live. BE Part of the Community No, this is not a mistake. Being part of the community through working at the Hub is one thing, but actively carving a space for yourself within the living organism that constitutes Impact Hub Vienna is what we are all here for. Share your success stories with us so we can scream about them from the top of the (virtual) mountain because your victory is our victory. No, not in the “we shall steal your thunder” kind of way. In the Hubby “we are super grateful you are letting us share your journey, you glorious person, you” kind of way. Talk to us about your ideas about making Impact Hub Vienna better. Let us exhibit your art. Share something that recently caught your eye in the Impact Hub Vienna Members group. Basically, help us help you. C-O-L-L-A-B-O-R-A-T-E Our space is filled with some of the most talented and creative people the city of Vienna has to offer. Designers, innovators, storytellers, digital experts – people who join co-working spaces because they want to think (and work) outside the box to create something new. This creativity is infectious and can only have a positive effect on you and your work. Take some time to look at the projects of other members and be inspired. Seeing what is possible can help you break through any blocks you have in your own work. Like what you see? Collaborate! The collaborative nature of our communities creates connections that not only increase members’ social capital, but also help to diversify investment sources, accelerate growth and boost impact. According to the 2019 Impact Report, in 2018 alone 1,500 projects were started together by two or more members! That’s not all. The Impact Hub Vienna space located inside Vienna’s hip district is designed for collaboration. From the member wall overlooking the kitchen on the groundfloor, to success stories, cosy pillows, coffee spots, quiet working corners, and lounge areas – we are enabling connection. I think collaboration is really connected with emotions. I want to work with someone because I trust them. Creating this trust is very important and one of the most common things to start this process is coffee. Coffee connects people and having an area where people go to take a break allows people to have conversations which leads to connections and collaboration. Standing tables are also very interesting because it’s been shown that people feel more secure when they are talking while standing up. When you are sitting behind something or sitting down, you’re not as open as you are when you’re standing up. But ultimately, the most important element is to understand how a particular organization or space collaborates and go from there. Creating Collaborative Spaces: An interview with Daniel Utrilla Mellinas Being in the City is Good for Your Business! Physical location is an important element for determining the future of your business. First of all, majority of trailblazing and well-prospering companies are located in areas directly plugged into the innovative urban ecosystems.The cities are the hubs of opportunities! Paul Graham wrote an article Why Startups Fail in which he names remote location disconnected from lively business areas as one of the grave startup mistakes. In a city such as Vienna you have access to support services (Impact Hub Global, Impact Hub Vienna or Vienna Business Agency), you can interact with other founders, you have access to skilled workforce and events, which offer networking opportunities. Impact Hub Vienna can be your home from home when travelling to Vienna. Check out the membership options, which offer registered address and postboxes, as well as key for 24/7 access to the Hub. Host an Event Hosting an event is one of the best ways to showcase your skills and attract new customers while simultaneously contributing to the community. For example, Skillshare Breakfast is a series of 90 minute long workshops hosted by members of Impact Hub Vienna or external professionals, on topics especially relevant for social entrepreneurs. They are taught in the morning while enjoying coffee & yummy food. Skillshare Breakfasts take the skills and expertise present in our community and distribute them among all of us. Do you want to verify your business idea or practice your pitch? Maybe you want to invite people to a skill exchange? Every single membership option offers a discount on event room rental. Take the plunge and host your first event at the Hub! If you are wondering where to start, we have prepared a guide for organizing a successful event! You should also check these four tips for hosting sustainable events. Share Your Success Milestones are important because they provide a sense of achievement and progress. Not to mention a good success story is a powerful tool when you are a new startup without a strong online presence. We are constantly trying to bring our members forward and celebrate their successes on our channels to spread the word about you to as many of our followers as possible. In 2016 we created the Success Stories board managed by the Community Hosting team. It sits quietly in the corner on the ground floor, dressed up in stories from IHVmembers, who made an important milestone. Let us assure you – no success is too small to be celebrated! Whether it’s your personal victory or result of months-long team work, we want to hear from you! Do you want to celebrate your success with us? Send your story to your community team contact person and we will post it on our wall and online. Make sure to include some details, date when it happened and any photos that we could use – please include copyright information if necessary! Show up to Events Attending events at the Hub is one of the best opportunities to jump into the network with both feet. We aren’t saying this because we are trying to boost our foot traffic. You can always make a friend while working at the Hub – we encourage you to say hi to the person next to you – but sometimes context is really important. And, let’s be honest, you aren’t hanging out at the Hub with the goal to meet every single member. Themed events are your best bet to meet people with whom you share interests and let them know who you are! Do you feel like you need a little bit of help with taking your networking game to the next level? Read our guide to becoming a networking superstar. It is so easy to get caught up in our own bubble and forget that there is a whole world out there, full of new ideas and discoveries every day. Attending an event not only gives you the opportunity to meet others but also gives exposure to new ideas that could be implemented in your own business. Impact Hub Vienna prides itself on delivering useful and relevant content by speakers who are in touch with best practices and latest advances. Attending a Skillshare Breakfast or aWineDown could lead you to dramatically improving the way you do business, just by implementing a few key ideas. Our events team is constantly working on keeping the events calendar busy with Skillshare Breakfasts, Melange um Vier sessions, Afternoon Energizers and Koch Doch community lunches, WineDowns and more. Our events are not only about knowledge-sharing and networking – we make sure to keep reminding you that your are a valuable member of the Hub and we would love for you to contribute. Start with being present and see where it takes you. PS. Make sure to visit our calendar of local events, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn to see event updates in your feed.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/24/ecosystems-of-connectivity-unido-and-global-cleantech/","ImpactHub","Ecosystems of Connectivity – UNIDO and Global Cleantech","The United Nations Industrial Development Organization supports commercialization of innovative cleantech solutions by working with developing country entrepreneurs and taking them to the world stage as part of the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme. Impact Hub Vienna is usually buzzing with start-ups, entrepreneurs, experts, and investors. These impact entrepreneurs have gathered from all over the city, the country, and throughout Europe to create a home for their companies and their networks. The start-up ecosystem in Vienna is vibrant and filled with support in the form of accelerator programs, a supportive community, and inspiring space for like-minded innovators. However, in October, the usually busy entrepreneurial hotspot is full to bursting with global entrepreneurs and investors; with legislators from around the globe and subject matter experts supporting new start-ups. Impact Hub Vienna hosts their annual social and environmental innovation conference, Impact Days. The Impact Days event brings in more than three hundred entrepreneurs and investors together to celebrate social innovation and impact. In 2019, it became a truly global event. The Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP) of the United National International Development Organization (UNIDO), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), have partnered with Impact Hub Vienna to highlight start-ups from around the world that specialize in cleantech. The UNIDO-GEF Global Cleantech Innovation Programme is an initiative to promote affordable and scalable innovations for sustainable energy, enabling partner countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. Strengthening Innovation Ecosystems Partnerships and close collaboration with all national stakeholders are critical to maximize synergies and share knowledge and best practices that can help in enhancing the contribution of cleantech start-ups towards climate change mitigation, while increasing productivity and generating growth and wealth, is UNIDO’s primary claim. And nothing is a better example of this than the integration and partnership between UNIDO and government agencies in South Africa. Senisha Moonsamy, Head of Innovation Skills Development at the Technology Innovation Agency, part of the Department of Science in South Africa, and Susanna Petronella from the UNIDO offices in South Africa sat down to discuss the partnership and the high level of integration between the government, UNIDO, and the GCIP Accelerator. “This is grounded in South Africa’s national development plan,” Moonsamy says. One of GCIP’s highlights is the annual competition-based Accelerator, which identifies the most promising innovators and entrepreneurs in a country, and the selected number of start-ups benefit from a rigorous, competitive national acceleration programme that trains, mentors, promotes, and connects them to potential investors, customers, and partners. “For us, these companies are de-risked and ready to be taken further. The GCIP provides a level of assurance and due diligence,” Moonsamy says of the partnership. The high level of governmental integration means further support can be given to these companies to help them enter global and national economies with a high degree of training and confidence. An excellent example of companies and government working together comes out of South Africa. Simon Hazell is a young entrepreneur who founded Inseco with business partner, Jack Chennells. Their company received the Youth Entrepreneur Award and was the national winner in GCIP South Africa in 2019, as well as the winner of the GCIP Forum 2019. Simon Hazell explains that his company specializes in organic waste management. As is evident by the company name, they use insects in this process. They convert organic waste into sustainable animal feed using insects, specifically black soldier fly larvae. “This provides an alternative to fish meal,” Hazell states. “One tonne of protein in our process means three tonnes of fish are left in the ocean.” Considering the dire predictions of Sea Shepherd, that all oceans could be dead by 2048, this is good news for the global animal agriculture market. The idea came about when Hazell and his business partner were working on a wine farm in South Africa. “They generated large volumes of organic waste,” Hazell says, referring to grape leaves and skins left behind in the wine making process. “We wanted to turn it into something beneficial.” For Hazell and Channells the GCIP “provides them with a great opportunity to access other organization, which will enable them to find partners to assist in soft landing in new markets.” The GCIP accelerator provides training and mentorship to companies, who are ready to take the next step; for some companies this is global investors and partnerships and for others it is taking the first steps on their own with an innovative product. Not matter the stage of development of the product or stage of incorporation, there are experts working within the ecosystems strengthened by UNIDO and national institutions which can help these entrepreneurs achieve their goals. Local Solutions with Global Impacts This year the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme showcased several impact start-ups, which, while solving local issues, have created viable global solutions for some of our most difficult issues. It is a sunny and warm day for October and Boonyarit Soonphonrai, CEO and Founder of Hybrid Aerator in Thailand, a quiet unassuming man sits outside Sophiensaal in Vienna to explain his technical innovation. He has created an energy service solution for waste water treatment. This is a very complicated way of saying he can save companies money with a simple and small solution, which creates an oxygen rich environment for bacteria to treat wastewater. “During my lifetime you could swim in the rivers in Bangkok. You cannot swim there anymore because of the water quality. The poor quality is due primarily to waste water. People do not want to spend the money to treat it properly,” and so it is flushed directly into the river. Soonphonrai used his mechanical engineering background to create a prototype of his solution. He approached a pulp and paper mill to try his prototype and to measure the amount of savings they would achieve on oxygen cannisters, energy, and labour by employing his solution, which is like a distillation column and helps maintain an aerobic environment for bacteria by using the principles of fluid dynamics. This means no oxygen cannisters, which means less waste disposal, less money spent on expensive oxygen cannisters to create an aerobic environment in large vats of waste water, and less labour costs for people adding these cannisters in the process. The Global Cleantech Innovation Programme has provided Soonphonrai the opportunity to speak to other local governments through France, Austria, and other countries in South East Asia about his innovation. Several companies worldwide have adopted his technology to save money and the environment. On the horizon for Soonphonrai and Hybrid Aerator are expansions into vertical farming, as the technology can allow for greater heights in irrigation. Finding a quiet spot in Vienna’s Sophiensaal can be a bit difficult. And in a quiet seating area on the second floor Salma Bougarrani explains what drives her and her company forward. She is the founder of Green WATECH. The confident entrepreneur loved hiking and exploring and while trekking one day was shocked to see children swimming in wastewater in a mountain river. “Cholera is still a pathogen which causes many childhood deaths,” Bougarrani states. “I spend my holidays in rural areas,” where this is still a problem. “I was looking for a way to help my community,” she says of pursuing studies to a PhD level to find a local and efficient solution for wastewater treatment specifically adapted to Morocco. This is quite an accomplishment for a young woman, as there are a dearth of women innovators in the STEM fields and with women holding fewer than 4% of patents, as a US patent office report finds. Her solution is a multi-soil layering technology, which filters waste water through a series of gradient levels ending with the patented brick. The technology has already been installed in two villages and she says the GCIP accelerator supported her through the certification and prototyping process, and helped to develop the company’s readiness. Her technology can be implemented the world over, wherever there are waste water filtration issues which cause disease. Wherever there are water shortages. This technology is an important step forward for the future of the world. The start-up ecosystem for impact entrepreneurs in South Africa, supported by the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme and national institutions has enabled entrepreneurs with big ideas and global impacts to take huge leaps forward with their innovation and global presence. Two further companies working in the impact sphere were at Impact Days, AfroBodies and Trash Cane Burner. Peter Duncan is one of the scientists behind AfroBodies, along with wife and CEO Benedicta Mahlangu. Their company has created a synthetic biological product called an antibody – specifically, a recombinant alpaca antibody, which is also known as a nanobody. Duncan shares a table with Moonsamy and Petronella, and is discussing some of the benefits of his technology. The initial plan was for health care applications but stresses on fruit farmer income and drought in South Africa drove farmers and exporters to look for innovative solutions to create better income security within their industry. Fruit for transport is bathed in chemicals to help in preservation on the long route from South Africa to European tables. However, there is no precise timing for the chemical bath and no specific ratios for the mixture. As a result, “ten to fifteen percent of the fruit is over exposed to these chemicals making them unmarketable. This means farmers plant the equivalent extra in their fields to make up for the loss,” Duncan says. And in an already water stressed environment, this means more fields to irrigate. AfroBodies developed their nanobody and detectors to determine the concentration of chemicals used in these preservative baths to prevent over exposure. “It binds to a specific chemical and makes it detectable and measurable,” Duncan says. “This means more fruit gets to market, and farmers will use less water.” South Africa is currently a water stressed country. However, this also means less food is wasted and there is greater income security for farmers. The detector is the size of a credit card, making it an inexpensive, reliable, and easy solution to several problems. The applications in the medical field are also immense as it could reduce time to diagnosis for fatal long-term illnesses, like cancer, in rural areas by putting testing directly in the hands of local health care practitioners. Food and income security are not just a problem for fruit farmers in South Africa; the sugar industry is subject to extraordinary fluctuations in operating costs due to changing prices in the energy and coals markets. Wolfgang Bernhardt is an older, soft spoken gentleman with an important solution to tonnes of carbon emissions in sugar processing. The engineer, turned management professor, offers a truly unique system which creates a closed economy in sugar processing. He has developed the Trash Cane Burner, which is also the name of his company. “Right now, companies burn coal in the process of making sugar and the leaves are left in the field,” Bernhardt says. “But the sugar cane leaves are rich in energy and are left on the field.” The Cane Trash Burner is a huge piece of industrial machinery, easily filling the airy front entrance of the Hub, according to the dimensions Bernhardt gives. The cost of the machine and its installation means a $12 Million USD investment on the part of a company but it can increase revenue by 50% as it eliminates the need to purchase coal. This decreases the CO2 emissions of processing by almost half as processing plants can now burn the leaves for energy. The sugar and fruit industries are massive and global, and are export income sources for many in developing countries. The South African ecosystem offers a well-connected and well-supported environment for innovation to thrive, as exemplified by these impact entrepreneurs and their projects. Innovative Futures Many of the ventures discussed their next steps and what they hope to see in their future. The Global Cleantech Innovation Program will continue to offer entrepreneurs the benefits of a well-connected and global innovation ecosystem. South Africa is expanding the reach of the program, according to Moonsamy. The program now includes two-week placements at Oxford University and outreach programs to historically black universities in South Africa to redress the imbalances of the past and help move innovation forward. Moonsamy said they were working with UNIDO partners to implement new parts of the program elsewhere in the world. The global future of cleantech is bright because of the partnerships UNIDO has fostered with the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme.

Accelerator Program Announces the 2020 Finalists","The fourth round of found! has officially started! Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna selected the most innovative teams for their jointly organised social start-up program from numerous interesting submissions. The six ventures are now starting a 5-month incubation phase to work with experts on their business plans. Their unifying goal is to create opportunities for people with a refugee background. In cooperation with the Impact Hub Vienna, the Deloitte Future Fund has been supporting socially oriented start-ups since 2016 through targeted workshops, mentorships and professional advice under the umbrella of found! program. This has already created numerous jobs and better job market opportunities for refugees in Austria. This year, too, as the next edition of found! is officially kicked off, the business models of all program participants are geared towards this purpose. “Our finalists are committed to a common goal: to promote the successful integration of refugees in the domestic job market. The high relevance of this topic remains undiminished and we are proud to make a valuable contribution in this area, ” says Bernhard Gröhs, CEO of Deloitte Austria. The six teams will again be accompanied by experts from Deloitte and the Impact Hub. As part of a 5-month incubation phase, intensive work is carried out to optimize the various business models. The two most promising start-ups will be selected by an expert jury at the end of the program and will receive further financial support as well as pro bono advice. “We are happy that found! program is entering its fourth round and we look forward to working with very exciting participants again this year. We have a diverse cohort, a mixture of already established social businesses as well as promising projects in the idea development phase, ” explains Lena Gansterer, Managing Director of Impact Hub Vienna.

FoodStories is a kitchen hub where refugee women are employed as cooks and cooking instructors, cooking their traditional dishes for delivery and catering and running cooking classes for individuals and groups. The Connection has been helping young migrants integrate and acquire language, school and social skills for 8 years. The Vienna Hobby Lobby offers free leisure program for children and young people from a disadvantaged social background. For many families leisure courses are very expensive, so that they can’t afford them. We work with ambitious young people with migrant background to give these courses. ÖkonoWie? is a young start-up from Styria. The team wants to assist refugees and migrants in understanding the basic business and economic knowledge necessary for the Austrian labor market, thus filling knowledge gaps as well as offering additional qualifications.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/31/how-corporate-volunteering-can-benefit-your-company/","ImpactHub","How Corporate Volunteering Can Benefit Your Company","According to the Deloitte Volunteerism Survey from 2017, 9 out of 10 respondents believe that companies who sponsor volunteering activities offer a better working environment that those who don’t. Encouraging, supporting and coordinating employees to participate in volunteering events is not only a powerful way to give back to the community but also positively impacts the employees’ relationship with their companies. Volunteering increases one’s satisfaction and motivation, and as shown in the study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation, it is also a great opportunity for professional and personal development. Research done by Points of Light Foundation shows that well designed corporate volunteering program acts as a unique talent development tool, potentially replacing formal training. And we are talking about much more than just team building! Corporate volunteering is also a great way to boost interpersonal or problem-solving skills as most of the time volunteers are faced with challenges that they need to overcome with very limited resources. Did you know that active volunteers move more easily into leadership roles? That’s not all – by being able to volunteer on behalf of the employer, employees get to know each other in a different way, often eliminating the hierarchy and leading to stronger identification with the company. And all of these employee-related benefits have a positive impact on companies – corporate volunteering is a cost-effective way to develop employees, increase workforce engagement and eventually become a more attractive place to work. And let’s not forget about the initial beneficiaries – non-profits themselves that receive time and know-how support, opportunity to establish new personal relationships and find advocates for the mission as well as potential donor relationship. How to Make the Most out of Corporate Volunteering To reap the full benefits of corporate volunteering, it is crucial that the program is well structured. While employee volunteering is relatively new in the European market there are plenty of examples and experiences to learn from coming from the US. Corporate volunteering can take different forms: hands-on or high-skilled, individual or group, one-off or regular. Below are some of the most popular approaches to making a valuable social contribution in the form of corporate volunteering. Social/impact days: team building events for good, when employees spend a day supporting a chosen non-profit usually with hands-on experience such as cooking in a shelter, planting trees or joining environmental clean-ups. Hackathons: One-day event where employees & non-pro<U+FB01>ts work together to solve problems or boost non-profits’ growth. For example, new online presence, fundraising campaign or HR strategy. It can also have a form of a challenge or competition. Individual volunteering: time and opportunities provided and coordinated by the employer, which allow employees to independently schedule and manage their level of contribution. How to Link Corporate Volunteering to Your Business’ Growth While the social impact benefit of corporate volunteering is obvious, as a company you are also thinking about the investment such program will entail. Corporate volunteering requires time and resources to set up, as well as potentially some financial investment. No matter how your company decides to get engaged, it’s important to maximise the benefits of corporate volunteering by connecting it with your business strategy. Five points below sum up what to keep in mind when designing a corporate volunteering program. Set up clear goals – it is important to have different internal stakeholders aligned from the very beginning, HR and CSR should work on that together. Be authentic! Tie the engagement to the mission and vision of the company. Let the employees do what they are good at – be creative and explore different partnerships. Make sure the engagement is high – get the buy-in from the top and promote, promote, promote internally. Measure the impact (internally and externally) – well-reported programs can be tied to the business outcomes of the company. It will make it easier to invest in social engagement in the future. Designing such a program requires not only extra resources on the side of the company but also non-profits. Companies often face dif<U+FB01>culties in identifying and arranging corporate volunteering opportunity and assessing its impact. They often do not know what the possibilities are and are not fully informed about the questions they should be asking. Some nonprofits advertise their willingness to establish partnerships to make corporate volunteering easier, but many don’t have enough resources to make it happen. This is how organizations such as Social Held step in. To bridge the gap between the willing companies and non-profits that need support, Social Held provides the expertise and know-how to create a seamless experience in finding the right volunteering opportunity for your company.

It’s a major milestone for our community and we cannot really express how grateful we are to have been part of so many people’s lives. Right off the bat, a HUGE thank you! Right now it doesn’t seem like a great time to celebrate – so many of us have been affected by the novel coronavirus spreading in the world. It’s easy to forget that in January, our lives looked so much different. Yet, we do want to remind you that the community that grew at Lindengasse 56 has always been resilient. The social impact community have always gone up against challenges that seemed too big to handle but, brick by brick, since 2010, we build solutions that bridge gaps in the areas of education, social inclusion, food value chain, circular economy, technology, and many, many more. This impact story comes from Jakob Detering, Managing Director, Social Impact Award International. Social Impact Award, founded in 2009, runs education and incubation programs in more than 15 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia to support early-stage social entrepreneurs in developing and implementing innovative business solutions to tackle the most important societal challenges of our times. They do so by hosting events and organizing workshops to raise awareness for social entrepreneurship, teaching the necessary skills to navigate from vague intentions to promising ventures, providing access to networks and promoting the best teams with the Social Impact Award. Impact is…Community In May 2010, I heard of the Social Impact Award for the very first time. With only a week left until the submission deadline, I decided I want to apply with an idea for a social business in Romania. Not to really implement the idea, but rather to learn how to write a business plan with a social focus. I skipped all my university courses at WU Vienna that week and started writing my SIA application. On the last day before the submission deadline, the Impact Hub opened its doors for all students that wanted to apply at SIA. I went there and finished my application (sitting at the same table for the whole day with Georg Tarne, who, shortly after successfully founded Soulbottles). After I submitted my application with just 5 minutes before the deadline – Georg and I had a beer together. We felt very happy about finishing the application on time! In the following weeks, I didn’t think much of the application anymore. After all, I had accomplished what I aimed for: writing a concise social business plan. It was why I was really surprised when a friend of mine (Leon Rainer, who founded Impact Hub Berlin a few years later), asked me if I would join him to attend the SIA award ceremony. He mentioned they offered free drinks – I couldn’t resist such an incentive! It turned out to be great fun anyway; I was fascinated by the Impact Hub Community, by all the ideas flying around in the room and the diversity of stakeholders present at the event. I grabbed my free beer and listened to the announcement of winners. Suddenly, the moderator (Nicole Traxler, today at Erste Foundation and CEO of BeeTwo) called me up on stage and announced that my idea won. I hadn’t expected that at all. Not that I didn’t find the idea or the plan worth the award, but the social business was to be implemented in Romania, while I was living and studying in Vienna. I had simply assumed that the SIA jury would never take the idea seriously. Yet, here I was. I heard it right. They called my name and invited me to the stage. I went up and found myself standing next to Prof. Nikolaus Franke, whom I knew only from my entrepreneurship courses at WU. As it was a hot summer day, I was dressed in a summer shirt, shorts and flip flops. While standing next to Prof. Franke in his elegant suit and answering his questions about my idea, I realized that this was a quite inappropriate style. After Prof. Franke finished his short interview, the event photographer shot the picture: I still hold this picture dear to my heart, even 10 years later, as it was the start of my journey into the world of social entrepreneurship. I had no clue what I was signing up for. Everything was new and I was totally unprepared – a sentiment best illustrated by my dress code that evening! However, the Impact Hub community was so open-minded and inviting that I felt home from the very first day. Whenever nowadays I’m attending SIA events in Europe, Africa and Asia (which happens a lot), I’m sharing this story and the flip flop picture with the audience. And the message is simple: It doesn’t matter how prepared or ready you feel for changing the world. It only matters if you have a supportive community around that believes in your idea and your talent. The Impact Hub Vienna has been this community to me in the last ten years. I’m extremely grateful for that. Jakob Detering Managing Director of Social Impact Award International PS. We need your help! The novel coronavirus poses a threat to our health, its aftermath will shake up our society and impact our economy for a long time. And especially the field of social innovation is at risk to have its progress thrown back by years, should some of its most promising and impactful actors, as well as the many still small yet beautiful initiatives, be forced to end their endeavors. Our members are affected by the economic downturn and we want to help them get through the tough times. We launched a Solidarity Fund, open to all current members of Impact Hub Vienna.

With today’s conversation, we want to add to this list an important topic, explored by one of the participants of the 2020 found! program by Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna: barriers to leisure time. As Rosa Haltmeyer, one of the co-founders of Vienna Hobby Lobby said, “Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generating ideas.” With that, I invite you to find out how this Viennese start-up supports children from disadvantaged backgrounds in learning outside of school. * Please note that we recorded the interview in February 2020 and it doesn’t directly address the current coronavirus situation. * (Top row, left to right) Farah Saad (frida), Ariane Olschak (frida), Petra Aji (FoodStories), Rosa Haltmeyer (Vienna Hobby Lobby), Leila Salehiravesh ([email protected]), (Bottom row, left to right) Valerie Mühlenburg (the CONNECTION), Diana Reuchlin (the CONNECTION), Denise Diex (ÖkonoWie?), Jasmin Abou Ahmed (ÖkonoWie). Photo © Lea Fabienne Photography – View the press release announcing the 2020 cohortHi, Rosa! Thank you for meeting me. To kick off the conversation, share with us your elevator pitch. Would love to! We have to pitch all the time recently! The Vienna Hobby Lobby offers free leisure courses for children in need. There are 400,000 pupils and teenagers that live in poverty in Austria and, as I started teaching in middle school in Vienna, I realised that almost all of them could not afford to go to dancing lessons or to a football game. We decided to offer these courses for free because we want all kids to be able to have free time activities and something to do after school. We want them to feel inspired, to get to know other kids in their communities and their districts. Leisure time activities should not be a privilege and we saw that it almost had become that in the last couple of years. What I am hearing is that you have been a teacher before you founded the Vienna Hobby Lobby. What is your background? Yes, although it is a little complicated! I attended fashion school in Vienna Hetzendorf, and then I switched to a BSc in national economics. During my undergraduate study, I started to get deeper into social policy and also migration and the educational system in Austria. I wrote my dissertation about the latter and this is how I got to know Teach for Austria, which is a great program through which you can teach even without studying to be a teacher specifically. I entered Teach for Austria. On top of that, and it sounds a bit cheesy, I always wanted to give back what I received. I received a great education and I had that possibility too to harness the opportunities given to me because my family always could afford that. Even though Austrian education is free, you still need your parents’ support, for them to know about the system and how it works. To compare, getting a good education was much easier for me than for a child from Syria, that only got here three years ago and is facing different problems. I always wanted to go in that direction, in the direction of supporting children that needed the most support. It sounds to me that you are a multi passionate person! That’s correct! But it’s often hard and a bit confusing! (laughter) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vienna Hobby Lobby (@viennahobbylobby) on Mar 31, 2020 at 2:24am PDT You are one of the four founders of your startup. How did you meet your co-founders? I actually met them through Teach for Austria. I discovered that I had a student, let’s call her Amanda. She always stayed late into the afternoon at my classes even though she had finished school already. Amanda did not want to go home because nobody was home, her parents worked a lot and they did not have much money left to afford to pay for some additional activities in the afternoon. This is when I realised that there are so many children that need something to do after school. I started talking about the lack of possibilities in the afternoon, the lack of support, anything that me and my colleagues always had as kids. Some colleagues, my co-founders, agreed with me that there were so many issues with what to do after school with these kids, who would come back from their holidays and say “It’s great that we are back to school because there was nothing for us to do at home”. That’s what connected us and we started working together. It’s absolutely great to have them in our team. From meeting your co-founders through Teach for Austria to getting into social entrepreneurship, that’s a bit of a jump. What motivated you to turn this passion project into a business? I always was afraid of becoming a social entrepreneur. It’s honestly the thing that I never wanted to get into because I knew how hard it could be, how stressful and tough it can become. It’s not always easy and it’s not always as glamorous as we think. Social entrepreneurship is really hard to get into. With the team, we had started already in my second year of Teach for Austria program and the events we organised attracted so many kids. The instructors, who were working with us on a volunteering basis, were so passionate about the project. Then, last year, we got into the Social Impact Award 2019 final and won, which meant we received some money to put into the idea. This is when I thought that maybe I should quit my job and focus on the project full-time. It wasn’t the social entrepreneurship aspect that attracted me but the prospect of seeing my project grow into a bigger idea, a project that is accessible to children all over Vienna. Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generate ideas. We want to make all children access that, develop themselves, have the same chances. Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generate ideas. We want to make all children access that, develop themselves, have the same chances. This motivation pushed me to take on this burden, become a social entrepreneur and pursue the goal, which is bigger than the job. Tell me a bit more about the business side of your idea. How did you approach market research to further identify this market niche? We already saw the gap based on our experiences. We performed an analysis, did a thorough desk research and found some projects that were doing similar things. For example, Wien Extra, which is amazing but doesn’t reach the children we encountered somehow. We talked with a lot of youth centres and they saw the need for something with passion, something different, that would engage kids and not only fill their time but also connect with them. We created a mini-pilot phase from March to May 2019 with seven courses and went into the schools and pitched our idea. A few kids came in the beginning and then more kids showed up. Actually, the demand was so huge in the end that we decided that this is worth pursuing. In our second phase, from September to December 2019, we launched 13 courses and we had more than 400 applications out of seven schools in the 10th district, in Favoriten. Who is the target group of Vienna Hobbly Lobby? We actually have two target groups. One of our target groups are children, and then we also target kids from middle schools within the Favoriten district. Our kids come from different backgrounds; they are migrant kids and special needs children, kids from Austria, too. There is another dimension to our project. Some of our instructors are also refugees, whom I met through different projects I was involved with. I got to know their problems and about their lives in Vienna, how difficult it was for them to get the permit to work. I suggested to them to join us and, in the past, almost half of our instructors had migrant or refugee backgrounds. They became these amazing role models for the children because they connected through their cultures and their understanding of various cultures. Everything works fine – the Turkish photographer is amazing with Serbian kids, Austrian kids and Turkish kids alike. The kickboxing trainer is from Damascus and he treats everyone the same but he also understands Arabic. They have so many different stories and they are willing to get involved with the project to gain more experience, to work with children. So, this started as a program for children only, but now we also focus on our instructors too. What would you say, as an educator yourself, are the particularly useful skills for someone working with kids with refugee or migrant backgrounds? I don’t think you need any special skill set, kids are all the same. They are amazing, they are impatient, but also passionate. Some are loud, some are quiet. You have these amazing small people, who are developing in their own kind of ways. What you need is what every teacher needs: they need to respect you, you need to know their boundaries, to have the cultural understanding of what they are going through. This is how we train our instructors as well, to see how to deal with conflict and deal with different religions and beliefs in one group. It’s way simpler than it seems. In your journey to becoming a founder, you mentioned that you knew beforehand what challenges entrepreneurship brings. It sounds to me that you were already in the circle of social entrepreneurship. Yes, we were already quite connected through Teach for Austria, they provide information about what to do after the 2-years fellowship program. When we started to create this pilot phase we also talked about getting funding, how to finance the project and what we will offer. Through the workshop with the Social Impact Award we connected to this network and we got to know Impact Hub Vienna too. Being in the SIA community we got to know found! and someone approached us and suggested that we should apply to the program. And this is how we qualified! I also studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and knew a lot about their activities. Everything is so well connected and it’s fantastic that you can get to know the people and information so quickly. There is always someone to help you out and suggest a new route or a new program, a grant. I like that everyone is so helpful and supporting each other. Sometimes there are conflicts and jealousy. However, in general, everyone is cheering each other and working together rather than against each other. What were the most helpful elements that propelled you further on your entrepreneur journey? I think it is a little bit of everything. The people you get to know and the connections you make, the stories you hear. You meet these great people, everyone wants to help, has an idea or feedback. Sometimes it’s absolutely horrible feedback, it really gets to you because the project is your baby. But this kind of feedback helps you even more than the praises that you get. The colleagues you find are another helpful aspect of being part of this ecosystem, you collaborate and form friendships. Finally, it’s the methods and business skills that you learn during different programs. For example, writing business plans, how to pitch, impact evaluation, and how to think about your finances. I studied economics so I was fine with the business and financial sides, but had to learn more about applying this knowledge in a social entrepreneurship environment. There is so much to learn! Now you are part of found! accelerator program. First of all, congratulations on being selected! Secondly, how has it been so far? Thank you! It’s amazing, even if we discussed some topics we have heard about previously, it also brought new interesting insights and perspectives. New ideas were generated and so many great people join you in your journey. It’s one of the best aspects of the program that you get access to such smart people, who root for you and email you things to do, discuss with you. They cheer you on and are happy with you when you succeed, just like recently, when the Vienna Hobby Lobby received a 10,000 Euro grant from MEGA Bildungsstiftung! This spirit of support is really something special. It’s one of the best aspects of the program that you get access to such smart people, who root for you and email you things to do, discuss with you. They cheer you on and are happy with you when you succeed, just like recently, when the Vienna Hobby Lobby received a 10,000 Euro grant from MEGA Bildungsstiftung! This spirit of support is really something special. I just want to say that the Deloitte mentors are amazing! We have these three people, who are so deeply involved and share so much knowledge with us. It’s such a privilege! You have been running the Vienna Hobby Lobby for one and a half years now. What would you say are the biggest lessons you learned in that period? First of all, never give up. Our journey has been a constant of ups and downs, ups and downs, and after every lowest point there is an extremely happy moment two days later. It’s a rollercoaster. Then, I would say, enjoy the team spirit. You can learn something new from everyone within the team, everyone has a talent, a strength, that is useful. It’s amazing to see how much these different talents are needed within our team. The team spirit is everything, the project is only as good as the people who work on it. If you have a great team, you achieve bigger goals. Don’t forget to celebrate the successes you reach. Money is tight and this is true for everyone, who is an entrepreneur. You have to be creative, you have to think a little bit differently, to solve the issue of limited financial resources. There is one question that I have been meaning to ask you. At Impact Hub Vienna we talk a lot about being an entrepreneur and entrepreneurs suffering from burnout. How do you manage when things get harder? We talked about burnout and stress a lot during the Social Impact Award and back then, I still had my job and I wasn’t a full-time entrepreneur. Once that changed, almost a month into it, I crashed. I had panic attacks, everything was too much because being an entrepreneur is very intense. I completely forgot what I learned during SIA, to put the project aside, take care of myself. It’s really tough sometimes. I still feel very anxious, overwhelmed, and two weeks later I feel complete joy and happiness because the project is going well. I think that fear of failure is a real issue and the pressure of everything happening at the same time. We should talk about this more openly, talk about coaching and therapy because you can’t do it yourself. You need a coach, a mentor. I am super lucky because we had a great mentor during SIA and we got three amazing mentors now, through found!. It’s really helpful to talk to people. I also have a coach whom I see on a weekly basis so I don’t lose my sanity. We should focus on these illnesses that we do not see easily, the illnesses plaguing my generation especially. Everyone is stressed all the time. It’s really important to be at peace with yourself, listen to yourself and take time to recover. You seem to be taking a very proactive approach now to manage stress! Yes, now I am! It took me nine months to figure out how to manage my schedule, how I want to work, what my routine is, what my outlet is. I do yoga in the morning, before I go into the day, I will get up earlier if I have to because it helps me. And there is one more thing that really helps me – budgeting. It really helped me to put a good budget in place, to really think about the future and save money. As an entrepreneur, you are responsible for people you work with and removing the financial anxiety helps so much. This realisation came to me during the found! program, as we are tackling the financial side of our venture quite intensively with the mentors. We have already had some successes thanks to the program! Thank you so much, Rosa! It was lovely to chat with you and I wish you even more success throughout the found! program and beyond!

As the fifth week of physical distancing in Austria is coming to a close, many of us – social impact founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs that make up the Impact Hub Vienna’s network – are looking to get a sliver of normality back into our lives with the announced loosened COVID-19 measures. Impact Hub Vienna community like everyone else has been affected by the economic downturn caused by the novel coronavirus, in smaller or bigger ways. We see you! And as a community, we remain committed to pushing forward. We are not losing hope nor willingness to innovate, collaborate, support and ideate! And we are here to act. Here’s a list of do-good things that you can do right now to support the amazing change-makers in Vienna. #1 Think Be Local I am sure you have seen many calls to support your local businesses on social media – I have! However, as the messages to think about engaging with local businesses flooded your feeds, have you ever thought about the meaning of being a local? How well do you know your neighbourhood? Would you ace a quiz on the social impact scene in Vienna? Have you tried the delicious hummus from Habibi & Hawara? Or the burgers by Rebel Meat? Do you own a pair of socks from Younited Cultures? Have you gone on a tour with Shades Tours? Being a connected local extends beyond going to your supermarket two streets away – it means getting to know your environment, discovering your city’s hidden corners, being able to recommend places to visitors, supporting the social businesses that contribute to making Vienna a much better place to live. How to be local: explore your city on foot make a “to try” list join the „Ich kauf’ nebenan – Wien“ (Gruppe) Facebook group swap recommendations with friends, family and other Impact Hub Vienna members rave about the shops and brands you love online – social media and business listings remain the top source of referrals for local businesses make your “Favourite Viennese Businesses” list and share it online #2 Try Something New Right now, we all are looking for entertainment. Online subscription numbers are spiking, we are listening to more podcasts, trying out new furniture arrangement in our living rooms. This push towards trying new things caused by an abundance of free time is quite beneficial for our well-being due to the fact that our brains LOVE and reward novelty. Experiencing something new increases dopamine levels in our brain, a hormone and neurotransmitter also known as “reward chemical” or “happy hormone”. The next time you want to buy something different, new, exciting, peruse this list of Austrian social impact businesses created by our member, Reinhard Herok, from way to passion. Learn something new! Content Creation School, uugot.it, Zero Waste Austria, UpLeveled offer interesting online courses. #3 Make Use of Your Online Voice The strict no-contact rules that were implemented to flatten the curve showed us the possibilities of technology. The Internet became an even brighter and bigger window to the world. There’s plenty of things each of us can do to help social businesses survive through the lockdown and help them restart their activities in May.

If you can and want to, consider supporting social businesses directly by donating money to their causes. Donate to Impact Hub Vienna Solidarity Fund – we are facilitating donations to members, who registered their ask for support Donate to the loved and cherished multigenerational cafe project, Vollpension.

It goes like this: a person enters the social impact innovation scene through the WU or BOKU universities, or through one of our many partners. They weave through the common connections, eventually finding their way to Impact Hub Vienna. One of such stories comes from Alpengummi, an innovative Austrian startup that often is featured in many podcasts, articles, TV or radio shows nationwide. And it’s not surprising – Claudia and Sandra, Alpengummi co-founders, are making big strides in getting their product to reach as many people as possible. Recently, they launched a crowdfunding campaign to purchase two production machines for their business! View this post on Instagram Endspurt! Am Freitag, 15.5. endet unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne auf www.startnext.com/alpengummi, das heißt auch die tollen einmaligen Angebote, die es exklusiv für unsere Crowd gibt <U+0001F642> also schaut rein & sichert euch coole Alpengummi-Sachen! <U+0001F600> #crowdfunding #alpengummi #endspurt #lastchance #coolesachen #sustainablestartup A post shared by Alpengummi (@alpengummi) on May 11, 2020 at 8:03am PDT The story of Alpengummi is one of the beautiful environmental impact stories that we like to think about to get motivated. Without further ado, here’s how Claudia and Sandra remember their Impact Hub Vienna moment of connection! Impact is…Support Network We had the idea of a natural chewing gum, based on natural and regional resources, during our international studies of environmental sciences at the BOKU University in Vienna. Alpengummi started as an idea for a business plan in a lecture that was aiming at fostering innovations in the forest sector. After we had created our business plan and had finished our first experiments in our own kitchen – which, we can tell you, was a highly sticky process, as we use tree resin as the main ingredient for our gum base – we decided it was time to share our idea with others. We started to organize tastings and looked for feedback to improve our chewing gum recipe. At about the same time, in spring 2018, the startup competition innovate4nature started its application round. innovate4nature is an annual startup competition from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Impact Hub Vienna supported by the federal government and the European Union, which offers an accelerator path for ideas that foster biodiversity and promote responsible production practices in Austria. Although our product development was not finished yet, we decided to apply. We were selected into the top ideas of the competition and thereby won a 6-months program membership, which included free working space at Impact Hub, support by experts and in the form of workshops, as well as 5.000€. This allowed us to improve our business plan and the product itself. In the end of the program, we also won the finals, which has further increased our money pot by 10.000€. Now we had enough money to seriously start developing the gum recipe and start the preparations for selling our gum. In April 2019, we took part in the Austrian TV-Show “2Minuten2Millionen”, where startups can look for investors and present their ideas to the Austrian public. This was the moment when we started to sell our Alpengummi – first at Billa and Merkur, then at small shops all over Austria. Later, we also opened our own onlineshop at www.alpengummi.shop. During all this time, we were mostly a two-girl-team, producing all the chewing gums by hand (until today we have produced 50.000 packs of gums), while also organizing everything else that a company needs (from sales to marketing and beyond) – mostly doing so from our co-working-space at Impact Hub, where we constantly got useful feedback and made a lot of long-lasting contacts. At this point, we must mention that we also met our graphic designer at a skillshare breakfast at Impact Hub: Natalia Garcez, a Brasilian freelancer, developed the amazing design of our Alpengummi. We were lucky that another program opened up at Impact Hub Vienna in 2019 – the RE:WIEN program by Oeko Business Vienna and Impact Hub Vienna. This incubation program supports start-ups and ventures which are based in Vienna and have developed an innovative product or service with great market potential. It was simply perfect for us and allowed us to keep our working space there for another half a year, while getting further professional help and feedback for our business. We are very thankful for all the great support, amazing contacts, professional help and warm hugs that we have received over the past couple of years at Impact Hub Vienna. The time at Impact Hub shaped our business journey and we felt part of a big family of social- and environmental entrepreneurs. The Impact Hub Vienna is still using our chewing gums as a thank-you goodie for special events and we hope that we will keep up this flourishing collaboration in the future! Claudia & Sandra Founders of Alpengummi PS. Want to become a social impact supporter? The novel coronavirus poses a threat to our health, its aftermath will shake up our society and impact our economy for a long time. And especially the field of social innovation is at risk to have its progress thrown back by years, should some of its most promising and impactful actors, as well as the many still small yet beautiful initiatives, be forced to end their endeavors. Our members are affected by the economic downturn and we want to help them get through the tough times. We launched a Solidarity Fund, open to all current members of Impact Hub Vienna.

While we are more aware of the existing hurdles and manage to build bridges in the job market, we are also still innovating the best possible solutions to making the entry obstacles easier to overcome. For a person who arrives in Austria without knowing the language or the culture, the first contact with Austrian legal system and paperwork can be really tough. This is why social impact startups like frida are helping to increase inclusivity. frida offers free and independent legal counselling for refugees and migrants, combining the two areas of law. Today we are happy to share an e-mail interview with the co-founders of frida: Ariane Olschak, Farah Saad, Marianna Mkrtchyan and Philipp Schmidtmayr. frida is also one of the ventures participating in the 2020 found! program by Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna. Who’s behind frida? Our key team members of co-founders of frida are Ariane Olschak, Farah Saad, Marianna Mkrtchyan and Philipp Schmidtmayr. Ariane Olschak is frida’s chairlady and legal expert. She has a Law Degree from the University of Vienna. Ariane has been working in different NGOs dealing with Asylum Law and familiy reunifications, as for example the Red Cross, for the last four years. Before joining the Red Cross, Ariane had been the head of the legal department of Asyl in Not for a year. She is currently working at ARGE Rechtsberatung. Farah Saad has a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science as well as Transcultural Communication. Currently, she is doing her Master’s Degree in Clinical Social Work. She has been active as a volunteer in several organisations and fields, such as tuition projects for asylum-seekers and refugees, legal aid and projects for vulnerable women*. Marianna Mkrtchyan is also part of frida’s legal team. Born in Armenia, she went to school in Vienna and Brussels and is currently studying law at the University of Vienna. During her studies, she has gained four years of experience working as a legal advisor at the NGO Asyl in Not. Growing up in an international environment and studying as a foreign student, facing issues, such as limited access to the labour market, she provides an important insight for frida. Philipp Schmidtmayr studied Law at the University of Vienna and has four years of experience in legal counselling in alien and asylum law. Having not only worked for several NGOs, but also for law firms, he has gained an even broader insight into legal affairs.

Photo © Lea Fabienne Photography – View the press release announcing the 2020 cohortIf you were to explain Frida to a stranger, what would you say? Frida is an NGO that specializes in asylum and migration law. We are a group of people of different professional backgrounds, such as legal and social workers as well as translators, and we offer free and independent counselling for refugees and migrants. What might be surprising to some is that our clientele is pretty varied – we consult, for example, also EU-citizens, students or people wanting to reunite with their families in Austria. What was the initial feedback to your startup idea? We feel that people liked the idea a lot and also understood the general sense of our approach. We were also very soon confronted with questions in regards to our revenue streams, sustainability and recruiting more team members. How did you meet your co-founders? Most of us met professionally, though Marianna and Philipp were roommates before we founded frida. We got to know each other because each of us was working in different fields of legal and psychosocial consultation. Because there was no organization combining these different areas of law (asylum and migration law), we were already working together closely, while being employed at different organizations. We started meeting outside of work and became friends, and that’s when the idea of founding frida arose. What was the decisive impulse to become a social entrepreneur and, finally, a company? We were all working together before founding frida and were therefore very aware that there was no organization combining our different work fields. So the idea to start a new organization had actually been in our heads for a while. When the Austrian government announced that starting with 2021, funding for independent counselling for refugees will be cancelled and taken over by a quasi-governmental institution, we made the final decision to take action. Of course, the founding process required a lot of planning – we had to find an office, recruit more team members, set up a website etc. But the motivation was there and we’re very glad the idea was realized and the word about frida spread so quickly. What was the most helpful in your journey to becoming a social impact venture founder? Our team had absolutely no experience in founding a social business, so it’s been difficult at first. We entered the Social Impact Award Program in 2019, where we got to meet many experts on the topic, as well as many peers, who were also in the process of establishing their social business ideas. The program helped us a lot in terms of professionalization, as is the found! program helping us right now. A very important lesson we learned is to always get as many opinions as possible on issues we’re not sure on or experienced enough with and to always stay true to our principles and to who we are as an organization. As a social entrepreneur, what moments of your job keep you going? The answer to this question will probably be the same with everyone working in the social field: to see the impact you’re achieving with your project. Since most social businesses are non-profit– with frida maybe being even more of an exception, since we are not aiming to make any profit at all – making an impact is the motivation behind most of our projects. With frida, there is of course a lot of frustration that comes with the fields of asylum and migration, but we get a lot of good feedback from our clients, which plays a big part in staying motivated. Based on your experience, what legal issues are most common among the people you help? As said before, our clientele is very diverse and so are the issues that we help them to deal with. At the moment, a very common issue is that of status cancellations. In 2015, a high number of refugees came to Austria, many of whom now have international protection. For some reason, since around 2018, the authorities started to terminate that protection for many people and are ordering deportations. This is often not understandable to us as well as our clients, since the situation in their countries of origin is mostly the same as in 2015, if not worse. We support these clients in keeping their protection or applying for long-term residency permits – in these cases it has again proven very useful that we combined asylum and migration law, so we can offer them different alternatives. The found! program of Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna entered its fourth round this year. How did you hear about it? Last year, we were one of the teams to win the Social Impact Award, which is also part of the Impact Hub Vienna. One of our team members, Farah, went to the SIA Summit in Kiev, where she got to meet many other social entrepreneurs. She heard about the found! program there and got very positive feedback on it, so we decided it might be a good fit for us and frida’s further development. Your favourite moment of found! so far? We very much enjoyed the kick-off, because we had read about the finalists‘ projects beforehand, but were very curious to meet the members of the individual teams. As happy as we are about our mentors and all the experts offering their expertise to us, a big part of accelerator programs like found! is always connecting and learning from your peers. It was also one of the few times we saw each other in person, since everything is taking place online now, so that was much nicer as well! COVID-19 changed everything. How do you deal with the new reality? It does affect us of course – we usually have open consultation, meaning everyone can come without an appointment and just talk to an advisor. There is no possibility to offer that now. We are of course still reachable for our clients through e-mail and social media and we offer consultation via video chat in emergencies, but we would like to be as accessible to everyone as possible, so we are currently working on even better solutions. Since the COVID-19 measures have been loosened a bit in May, we can offer more appointments again and not just restrict it to emergencies. Thank you for taking the time to share the story of frida, Ariane, Farah, Marianna and Philipp! Good luck with the found! program jury event in June!

When erdbeerwoche became part of the Impact Hub Vienna community, they did it with a bang. Some members will remember the first reveal of the “Bloody Woman’ t-shirts <U+0001F609> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Menstruation & Monatshygiene <U+0001F353> (@erdbeerwoche_) on Sep 22, 2015 at 4:08am PDT erdbeerwoche is the first social business from Austria to specialize in menstruation with the aim of leading a change in the way society perceives periods and bringing sustainable menstrual hygiene into the mainstream. Just one year younger than Impact Hub Vienna, erdbeerwoche went from a period talk trailblazer to myth buster – and they continue to educate people in Austria on the role of sustainability and openness when it comes to menstruation. Dive into the impact story sent by the incredible co-founders of erdbeerwoche – Bettina Steinbrugger and Annemarie Harant. Impact is…Breaking Taboos While the ImpactHub Vienna celebrates its 10th anniversary (congrats, by the way!), we celebrate nine years of our company’s existence. Our social business idea grew alongside as we started dealing with the topic of menstruation, a topic considered a taboo much more back then that it is today. And it was nine years ago, in 2011, when we moved into a newly renovated Impact Hub Vienna. Menstru…WHAT?! At the very beginning, there was a lot of surprise on all sides: “What? You are dedicated to the topic of M-E-N-S-T-R-U-A-T-I-O-N??? And you want to sell organic tampons and menstrual cups??? Are you okay???”. Now, 9 years later, we have managed to educate millions of women; teach tens of thousands of young people; and replace over 7 million conventional tampons and sanitary towels with sustainable alternatives. In the meantime we are no longer looked at weirdly or smiled at with obvious pity or humour. On the contrary: the topic of menstruation has reached the center of our society and that’s a good thing! Founders of erdbeerwoche (from left to right) Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger. Why “erdbeerwoche”? We are often asked about our name, translated from German as “strawberry week”. “Is it about strawberries?”, people as us. No. The strawberry week is all about menstruation. And because a company cannot be called “menstruation”, we chose a term that gave this taboo subject a positive meaning and, at the same time, ironically alludes to the countless terms that were invented to disguise the unambiguous and uncomfortable terms. Other examples being “Tante Rosa” (Aunt Red) or “red Ferrari”. We, champions of open conversation and menstruation, call terms related to menstruation by their name, but still: “strawberry week” is a door opener that 90% of people, who hear it, will no longer forget. View this post on Instagram #FunFactFriday : “Breaking taboos about menstruation ” is the message our venture @erdbeerwoche_ wants to shout out to the world. When being at a fair and introducing their chemical free organic female hygiene products a women stopped and seemed very interested. Without further ado she unwrapped a tampon and used it as a pendulum in order to find auf if it had the right energy for her! Luckily she approved <U+0001F609><U+0001F52E> A post shared by Impact Hub Vienna (@impacthubvienna) on Feb 24, 2017 at 6:37am PST There’s one thing that we noticed, namely: anyone who deals openly with taboo subjects also gets positive feedback. We noticed this in our youth work program, our digital learning platform READY FOR RED, as well as in discussions with “old white” men. We always benefited from our approach of clarifying facts and doing so with humour. This way most people we interact with or who come in touch with our brand can really start diving into the topic and many are really thankful that they have finally found a sparring partner in us with whom they can also talk about such “sensitive” topics. The ImpactHub Vienna in particular was an important support for us, because we found many discussion partners there who were very open to the topic. Investment Ready Program In 2015, we then participated in the ImpactHub Vienna’s Investment Ready Program, which helped us critically examine our corporate purpose and also to further develop our business model. A lot has happened since then and our core business has continued to develop. erdbeerwoche’s business model is now divided into three areas: on one hand, our education platform erdbeerwoche.com, which also includes our passion project READY FOR RED: a digital learning platform that provides young people with everything they need to know about menstruation in an age-appropriate manner. Here we cooperate with public bodies such as the City of Vienna as well as with companies that have similar missions and that enable us to do this educational work. For example, in every package of the Italian menstrual products brand Organyc you will find a free access to READY FOR RED. Our second pillar of erdbeerwoche is our online shop, in which women can find everything a heart desires to make their period purchases sustainable: from organic tampons and menstrual cups to our specially produced fair trade period panties. Last but not least, the third element of our business model is made up of our political work and activism. We have been campaigning for the reduction of the tampon tax for years (already successful in Germany!) and for more transparency regarding the ingredients of monthly hygiene articles. Our current campaign called “Periods for Future” is organised in cooperation with Generation Blue, the water youth platform of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism (Die Wasser-Jugendplattform Generation Blue des Bundesministeriums für Landwirtschaft, Regionen und Tourismus). The campaign is aimed at educating people about the correct disposal of menstrual products. So there is still a lot to do overall and we look forward to continuing along this path with ImpactHub Vienna!

The coronavirus pandemic has been a challenge none of us was prepared for. When the pandemic turned from news stories into globally enforced lockdown measures, the innovative network of social entrepreneurs at Impact Hub Vienna saw their income slowly dry out or disappear entirely overnight. We cannot let this happen. Social innovators solve social or environmental problems using a collaborative, entrepreneurial approach while making their businesses work. They build businesses that support the creation of a more sustainable, resilient, and just world. This network has taken years to grow and losing it right now is not an option if we are to ever reach the Sustainable Development Goals. We have established a Solidarity Fund to make sure that the livelihoods of the many social entrepreneurs that are part of our beautiful network are secured. Watch the explainer video to find out more about the Solidarity Fund’s story: How the Solidarity Fund works This Solidarity Fund is our COVID-19 community support response, established by Impact Hub Vienna, run with the support of impactory, and operated by our – new – charitable Impact Hub Vienna Association. Solidarity Fund is facilitating donations. Everything that’s put into it, goes to the Members, who have requested help. Solidarity Fund is an ongoing fund. The set measures and their aftermath will affect us for an unknown period, so as long as there is momentum (and donation), the Solidarity Fund will be live and operational. For every member who needs it. Anyone, who is a member of Impact Hub Vienna and requests help, will receive it. There will be no questioning nor challenge from our side. With monthly payout. We don’t know how much it will be, but every month, starting May, we will look at the amount received, take 60% of it, divide it by the number of requests, pay it out in equal shares, and take the other 40% forward as a first building block for the next month. Operated in full trust. Yes, every request by a member will be accepted. Yes, everyone will receive exactly the same amount. And no, there will not be any selection nor assessment. We trust this community to assess how much everyone needs and / or can give. More information about this initiative can be found here. Support social entrepreneurs in Austria Take action now and contribute to the Solidarity Fund As a network of people, who believe in every single person’s ability to make a meaningful contribution to a better future for all of us, we are counting on you. Help our Members continue inspiring journeys.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/07/30/urban-innovation-covid-19/","ImpactHub","How Innovation Leads the Cities through the COVID-19 Recovery","Covid-19 is changing the way we see everything, from the importance of scientific and media literacy to logistics. “The new normal”, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says, is here and it seems like it will be like this for a while. And while we continue to confront this global health crisis, Covid-19 exposed some extraordinary fragilities in our systems and infrastructures and we will need the help of governments and social entrepreneurs to recover and ensure resiliency in the future. Urban spaces had not been prepared for COVID-19 There were news reports about animals coming back to urban spaces. Venice saw the return of dolphins to the canals and clear water, both rarities because of the amount of boats in the city and its harbour. A herd of wild goats took in the sites in North Wales. Deer foraged for food in the abandoned streets in Japan. Not everything was as cheerful as the dolphins and sightseeing goats or as calm as deer, despite the damage they did to people’s gardens. Barcelona saw boar come down from the mountains, and everyone saw the video of the monkeys fighting over food scraps in Thailand. These stories highlighted our interconnectedness with animals in the urban ecosystem and the damage we have caused with our sprawling presence. Early reports and studies from environmental researchers seem to suggest air pollution wasn’t as problematic during the Covid-19 precautions. Maps showing the near disappearance of dangerous greenhouse gases from the troposphere over China were released by NASA in early March. The curtailing of global tourism, high production levels, and decreased road traffic all played a significant role in the rise in air quality, globally. In Vienna, people opted for more cycling and walking rather than taxis and transit, according to ÖAMTC and this trend has continued afterwards, with more cycle traffic on Vienna’s streets. And this will influence how we see travel, consumption, and cars in the cities as we move forward. People moving through the city to meet their daily needs also became a concern during the precautionary measures. The longer a person was out, the higher the risk of exposure, and the more likely they could pass the virus to others but our need to use greenspaces and be outside, in addition to purchasing food and other supplies, did not diminish. Green spaces and their use have positive effects on our mental health, even just seeing them, in addition to helping with the climate crisis and positively affecting other environmental aspects of urban planning, including heat management, resilience to destructive invasive species, and biodiversity conservation within the urban ecosystems. Community Mobility Reports by Google show a month-to-month increase in the number of visits to green spaces in Austria since March 2020. Supply chain management and logistics became vitally important during the Covid-19 crisis as we saw worldwide reports of food wastage in some countries and extraordinary crop damage in others. We were also forced to confront the reality of how our food is harvested by low wage workers brought in from countries suffering from economic hardship in Eastern Europe. However, other aspects of the supply chain were brought into focus as toilet paper and other necessities sold out across the city within hours of precautionary measures being announced. And while the panic subsided after a few days and stores were fully stocked once more, it still affected vulnerable populations within cities in the moment. Which prompted countries following in the wake of Austria’s decisions to impose different restrictions, enabling the elderly and disabled to get supplies needed earlier than others. And further, we saw the neighbourhoods, globally, which were the hardest hit were the most impoverished. This exposed an on-going class divide across the world. In Paris, the suburbs with the highest infection rates were the over-crowded, ethnically diverse, lower income areas which were home to the people who were considered necessary to work during the outbreaks – cashiers, security guards, delivery people. Which means, they are the people most at risk of exposure in their daily lives, compared to people who were able to work from home in suburbs in which it was easier to socially distance. And for some in these neighbourhoods, and elsewhere across the world, this meant job losses because their job required them to be there in person or required less staff during restricted opening hours. In the United States and United Kingdom, similar reports flooded the media. This has fuelled discussions across the world about racism and classism and how we can better support each other as we move forward, as humans confronting this crisis. We are still living through a global cataclysmic event. Our mindset and thinking needs to change to incorporate these lessons learned. Which means many cities and nations are adjusting their thinking on urban development, across a whole host of issues, from socially distanced green spaces to new economic models. Biking on the rise in the European cities Across the world, governments are having to rethink their approach to issues. Vienna was given the distinction of being the World’s Greenest City this year. Its myriad of public parks and environmental preservation areas within the city contributing to this prestigious title, and to its much-coveted Mercer ranking as the best city in which to live. Vienna’s thinking on green spaces has long been evident in its urban planning, always ensuring there are easily accessible parks and playgrounds for everyone to enjoy. In the months before the Covid-19 crisis fully hit, Vienna unveiled two new programs to increase the green space and lower greenhouse gas emissions: increasing the pedestrian zones in the city and greening building facades. The new pedestrian zones would take accessibility into account, which meant evening out the roads and cobbles to make walking easier for everyone and extending the boundaries. Vienna has started putting up vertical gardens on building facades and partnered with Dachgrün, a Vienna based landscaping firm which has a full product range supporting green rooves and vertical gardens, to make it happen. However, these were all decisions made before Covid-19 necessitated social distancing. Precht, an Austrian based architecture firm proposed a design for a socially distanced park. The park is to be installed in a vacant lot in Vienna. It features wide, winding lanes separated by tall hedges and gates which would tell people if walking routes were occupied. Parc de la Distance would enable people to take advantage of green spaces for their mental and physical well-being while taking in their concerns about the highly contagious nature of the virus. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has committed to a more cycling friendly city to ease concerns about the communicability of Covid-19 on public transport. She has run on environmental platforms before but has increased her efforts and commitment since the Covid-19 measures were put in place. Hidalgo imagines what she calls “the 15-minute city” where people are easily able to meet all of their needs within fifteen minutes of home on environmentally sustainable transport, so on foot, cycling, or public transit. Which means better access to food, vital supplies, and medical care for everyone within the city limits. Amsterdam is looking deeper and tackling the issue of overall economic models in its post Covid-19 planning. It will be adopting the “donut model” of economics, developed by Kate Raworth at Oxford University. The model is designed to help cities, nations, and states to thrive in balance with the planet. Her theory is described as “a breakthrough alternative to growth economics” by The Guardian. In brief, the theory uses the United Nation’s sustainable development goals to define the basic standard for everyone and everything, which is the interior ring. The outside of the donut is the ecological limit of the planet; the boundary we should avoid crossing to limit our damage to the earth and its inhabitants. The dough which forms the ring, the tasty sugar confection we all enjoy, and the part we can still all enjoy. It represents economic stability, meeting the needs of everyone, and ensuring the planet thrives. The model takes into account everything from economic disparity to building new infrastructure using environmentally sustainable materials. City officials in Amsterdam are hoping this new economic model will help them navigate the post-Covid-19 recovery economy. Redesigning shared city spaces for safety It is more than just the overarching ethos of a city that is affected, whether it is green spaces, alternative economic models, or accessibility. Urban environments are home to large buildings which house lots of people, whether it is in flats, offices, or hotel rooms. During the precautionary measures for Covid-19 people worked from home, people shared spaces in their homes for longer lengths of time with more people than usual, and normal hotel operations were shut down and some buildings were co-opted as a place to house residents in quarantine or as surge capacity for the health care system. Enterprising design firms have already put thought into how these spaces might look as the world restarts after 2020. The London architecture firm of Weston Williamson + Partners has turned their considerable talents towards reimaging work places and office buildings. Their proposal takes into account more people working from home and allows for rotating use of the office space which enables larger gaps between desks and open spaces for socializing while maintaining social distancing. They are proposing environmental measures like bicycle rental and scooters to enable people to get to and from work with ease and building wider pedestrian sidewalks outside of new developments to handle the increase of people while maintaining distance. The say it is a chance “to green a city” according to an interview in De Zeen, an online design magazine. They also make space for food vendors, testing areas, and open windows to allow better air circulation rather than relying on climate systems which recycle air. Another UK based architecture firm, The Manser Practice, envisions a new way for hotels to operate in the post-Covid-19 environment. Their proposal includes automated temperature checks at equally automated check-in desks. And it incorporates individual exercise pods in rooms with spectacular views and old fashioned dumb-waiters to provide room service to guests. Woods Bagot, the global design firm headquartered in Australia, has put their considerable effort and talent behind devising a split-shift flat. The moveable modular flat incorporates space for exercise, play, and work. It has three modes, day, night, and play. The design firm also tried to address issues in fragile agricultural supply chains by incorporating aquaculture gardens in its proposal. Space for Social Entrepreneurs At Impact Hubs throughout Europe social entrepreneurs have been tackling the issues brought to light by Covid-19. Impact Hub Berlin held a hackathon to discuss and propose solutions to the issues the virus presented in Berlin. Their hackathon will present a series of innovative solutions to political and business leaders from the over 1200 submissions they received. The social entrepreneurs proposed everything from medical alarms to apps to connect you with local services to avoid an Amazon purchase. Urban connectivity, sustainability, staying local, and social impacts were the focus of these entrepreneurs. In Vienna, Lenkerbande is helping people access bicycles through the sharing economy. Which was helpful, given the Austrian government advised avoiding public transit during the precautionary measures and there has been no decline in cycling in the city since, one only needs to look at the morning bicycle traffic near Schwedenplatz to see it. This innovative start-up enables people to fix their own bikes and offers tools and expertise to help keep riders moving. They also repair donated bicycles, making them road ready again, giving access to people who might not be able to afford access to the expensive cycling market. This focus on sustainability and social impact is what will help Vienna navigate the post-crisis world. Vollpension, the innovative social impact cafe who employs grandparents to make delicious baked goods, needed to find a way to navigate the post-Covid-19 restrictions for restaurants but had the added difficulty of a vulnerable population making up part of their workforce. They came up with and tested a new business model, which included time slots for reservations and a fixed price set menu. They also offered delivery options during the precautionary measures. These social entrepreneurs were leading the way during and post-outbreak. The solutions, proposed by cities and design firms, can only address so much. Which creates a huge space for social entrepreneurs to work in and innovate complimentary strategies. The myriad of problems and the fragility of our existence exposed by the Covid-19 crisis mean that cross segment and sector cooperation is necessary to solve the issues. In an interview with the World Economic Forum Sarah Jensen Carr, an assistant professor of architecture at Northeastern University in Boston, says that illnesses like Covid-19 and other historical outbreaks have galvanized people to work together to create safer futures, better environments, and more supportive social ventures. Impact Hub Vienna’s entrepreneurs know their city unlike anyone else. They have already proposed ideas and solutions to Vienna’s challenges, from the invisibility of the homeless to using the coffee grounds from local restaurants to grow mushrooms. We know these groups will be able to propose new ideas to help Vienna navigate the post-outbreak world while improving our environment and creating social impact.

Webinars have become one of the most popular modes of interactive events. However, hosting a webinar using your laptop webcam is not the most efficient way of building your brand when the sound quality is bad, the computer image keeps freezing and the internet connection keeps failing. A poorly prepared or reviewed event will mean that in the future your audience may not choose you again or worse – go to your competitor! How can you host a professional webinar and attract your target audience? In this must-read article you will find 12 expert tips from Matthias Gritsch, CEO of Austrian Webinars, on how to prepare and host a successful online webinar that benefits your brand. Dig in! 1. Keep your webinar title short and snappy People move through the digital universe with a short attention span. So the most important thing is to create a short and snappy title for your webinar. Put yourself in the position of your target group and try to choose the title that sounds most promising. The title does not have to explain everything about the event, but should encourage further reading of the description of the webinar. Do not use abbreviations or terms that your target audience may not understand. Depending on the content and target group, you can also choose a provocative title. 2. Choose the right time and duration of your webinar Your webinar target audience may have certain habits. You shouldn’t schedule a webinar for teachers at 10:00 a.m., as they will most likely teach. Avoid lunchtime. However, when you are looking to engage businesspeople, try to schedule your webinars in the morning. Startups or young companies regularly open for business between 9:00 and 10:00. If you want to target customers, you should aim to host your webinar to fit into their free time – between 17:00 and 20:00. Topics that require the full attention of your target group should be addressed early so that their mind is still fresh and ready to concentrate on more complex ideas. Think about a reasonable length for the topic. Sometimes it’s better to have shorter webinars but run them as a series of events. 3. Marketing your webinar is key As with any digital content, you should start promoting your webinar very early. Write an expert blog entry and share it on social media – make sure to include a link to your webinar! If possible, make a video teaser that creates excitement and captures people’s attention. Create an opportunity for your target group to share the video, the blog entry or the registration link in easy to take steps. Make sure you do some active outreach too, for example, post an announcement about your webinar to relevant groups in your community. Comment on articles or create an event page on Facebook. Don’t forget that e-mail is still the most effective way to get in touch with your target audience to make use of your mailing list or plug your event into newsletters that amplify your reach. 4. Set clear goals, measure your success, and collect feedback Before you put a lot of time, effort, and money into a webinar, you should set goals and be clear about what you want to achieve with the webinar. It doesn’t matter whether you want to win new customers, train employees or sell products. After the webinar, it must be clear whether you have achieved your goal, what you can do better and whether you have met the expectations of your audience. 5. Always invest in good technology The quality of your video and audio stream are crucial to capture and hold the attention of your webinar’s participants. Poor sound quality is an absolute no-go. Do not use the integrated laptop microphone, but invest into a professional table microphone. Get recommendations from professionals as to which hardware is currently recommended or borrow a mobile webinar studio with a camera, table microphone and light. 6.Take care of the camera position and pick a neutral background The webcam should be positioned at your eye level. If necessary, place your laptop on a box or put a few books underneath it. The background should be simple and clutter-free. Avoid sitting with your back to windows or other sources of light – they will render your video too dark and negatively impact the quality of the image on screen. Don’t use roll-ups with a lot of writing or distracting elements in the back. 7. Use interactive options One of the reasons why webinars are better than live streams is that the audience can get in touch with you and interact with you in a structured way. Make sure that your webinar structure is clear to all participants and tell them at the very beginning about the possibility of interacting with you, for example, via a chat. Allow enough time for a Q&A session at the end of the webinar or answer the questions immediately as they come up. When you do answer, keep your responses to the point and brief. Sometimes, there might be no questions at the end of the webinar. Always prepare the most common questions yourself to go through them in such cases. This often brings up further questions from the audience. 8. Record your webinar Record your webinar and send it to all attendees, including those who have registered but have not attended. Make sure you edit the video to include a branded intro and outro! 9. Test internet connection and speed beforehand Make sure to check your internet connection before the webinar to prevent any technical difficulties. Make sure to be plugged into Ethernet instead of using a WiFi connection – the latter is often unstable. Only a sufficient upload speed guarantees the trouble-free and high-quality transmission of image and sound. 10. Keep your presentation simple Don’t shower your audience with too much text or elaborate animations in your presentation. A common question from your audience will be whether they can get the slides after the webinar. You can anticipate this question right at the beginning by telling the participants that they will receive the presentation as a PDF via email after the webinar airs. 11. The best comes at the end The content of your webinar should be absolutely relevant to your audience. Start by telling your audience what to expect. A good tip is to announce something relevant or interesting at the beginning of the event telling the audience that you will be presenting this exciting part in the middle or at the end of the webinar. This will increase their interest and the participants will be most likely to stay until the end. At the end of the webinar, make a call to action / offer for your products, services or advertise your next webinar. 12. Hire a webinar professional If you want to hold a professional webinar, it is worth hiring a webinar professional who will advise, coach and accompany you step by step through the technology and software.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/08/26/what-are-we-going-to-do-about-fast-fashion/","ImpactHub","What are we going to do about fast fashion?","Fast fashion is wasteful. I know, it is a line you have heard a million times before (or seen in print in a thousand different iterations). The problem is, we still haven’t changed, no matter how often it is said or written. So, it bears repeating. Fast fashion is wasteful. Just so we are all on the same page, we are going to define fast fashion. The term is used by the fashion industry to refer to designs which capture current fashion trends quickly, inexpensively, and in mass quantities. However, most people outside the industry who use the term define it as “the rapid turn-over of low-cost garments in the global clothing industry”, according to Smart Asset in a 2018 article on credit card debt. This definition encapsulates everything from the design through to consumer sales and the one we are definitely using here. There are a lot of issues with fast fashion, many writers have tackled the subject, and BookRiot has a list of the most eye opening books on the issue. A lot of these books cover the human cost but there is an environmental toll to pay as well. In her 2013 book, Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion, Elizabeth Cline attempts to give readers insight into some of the cost impacts, “[i]n 1930, the average American woman owned nine outfits. Today, we buy more than 60 pieces of new clothing on average per year.” This is in part due to the decrease in the cost of clothing, facilitated by fast fashion companies and brands. According to the European Environmental Agency, the price of clothing dropped 30% between 1996 and 2018. Which means we just purchased more clothing. The True Cost, a 2015 documentary film directed by Andrew Morgan that focuses on fast fashion, is credited by many as one of the moving forces behind uncovering the realities of fast fashion production to the public eye. According to Smart Asset, people buy five times as much clothing as we did forty years ago. And in an article Cline wrote for The Atlantic, she says that Americans send 10.5 million tonnes of clothing waste to landfills every year, according to 2014 research. Europe is no different, according to 2016 numbers, the EU textile industry sends 16 million tonnes of waste to landfills each year. This number does encapsulate the whole of the textile industry, which does mean the manufacturing process as well, so the waste which comes from cutting the pattern is wrapped up in this number as well. However, before we manage to rationalize half the environmental impact away and place it firmly on the shoulders of producers, we need to remember that wasted fabric is also wasted money for them. They will stretch the fabric as far as it can go and cut as many pieces from it as possible. And this is just what gets sent to landfills. The textiles people throw away because their jeans have a hole in them or they ripped a t-shirt at the seams. But what about the stuff we donate? The things in the back of our closets from a couple of seasons ago that we wouldn’t wear anymore because the trends have moved so far forward or because our weight has fluctuated enough to necessitate the purchase of a new wardrobe. We donate them in the bins conveniently placed throughout Vienna or to individual shops. But given the amount of clothing we purchase it means charity shops and thrift stores can rotate out stock which doesn’t sell faster than a major fast-fashion brand. This has created a whole global supply chain of second-hand clothing. According to the BBC there is a €3.6 billion global market in second-hand clothing. In his book, Clothing Poverty, Dr. Andrew Brooks suggests consumers are unaware of the totality of their impact on the global environment when they purchase clothing from fast-fashion brands. His research shows that anywhere from 10-30% of donated clothing is sold at shops. The rest is sold to clothing recyclers and the global market. He details where several items of clothing end up, like donated dress shirts often get purchased in bulk by dealers in Pakistan, winter coats by dealers in Eastern Europe, and summer clothing in the clothing markets in Northern Africa, where they are suffering from an influx of surplus second-hand clothing. According to Patrick Grant, a prominent fashion designer and judge on the Great British Sewing Bea, “we have enough clothing on the planet right now to clothe the next six generations of the human race.” And that is a lot of clothing when you consider the exponential growth rates we are currently experiencing. There is also just straight up pollution and resource use as an ecological impact. The European Environmental Agency reports 3500 separate chemical used in the manufacture of clothing, with 750 of them being hazardous to humans and 440 being hazardous to the environment. Their research suggests that 20% of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry, through dying or other chemical processes used in production. Furthermore, the report states a production of a tonne of textiles creates 15 – 35 tonnes of CO2. In 2017, they estimate that each person accounted for 654kg of CO2 as a direct result of textile consumption, which really just means purchasing new clothes. And finally, we come to microplastics. Oftentimes, cheaper fabrics used in fast fashion are synthetics, like polyester, nylon, and acrylic. The European Environmental Agency mentions this in their report. According to an article in Vogue earlier this year, clothing made from synthetic materials are shedding these microplastics into the water when they are washed and the air when they are worn. And researchers are not entirely sure how much is directly related to the clothing we wear, yet, but the current estimate sits at about 35% according to research published in the Environment Journal. But it is probably quite a lot. Given that a WWF report, as detailed in The Telegraph, estimates we consume the equivalent amount of plastic to a bank card every week. Policy Progress on Regulating Fashion Industry This is a huge problem, and one social entrepreneurs cannot be expected to tackle on their own. Fortunately, the European Union is already making policy recommendations and funding research and task forces. With the backing of the European Civil Society Strategy and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, who has a make fashion circular initiative, the EU is taking steps to change our current ideas about the economy of fashion. The EU initiative RESYNTEX, hopes to create a new idea for a circular economy for fashion. They are currently billed as a research project looking to understand how to keep “post-consumer non-wearable waste” from our landfills and incinerators. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is throwing their whole weight behind the idea of circular economies and waste reduction. WRAP is a new initiative at the EU level which is designed to fight clothing waste. The program has some high-profile influences, from the Danish Fashion Institute, the British government’s Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), and significant links to the Ministry of the Environment in the Netherlands. According to the WRAP reports, if the SCAP 2020 targets are met this would mean saving “16,000 tonnes of waste (equivalent to over 1,300 double decker buses), 420 million m3 of water (or 160,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools) and 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (or the annual emissions of almost 250,000 cars).” In September 2018, the Danish government released their strategy for a circular economy. The plan aims to have businesses incorporate circular economic models into their business plans and manufacturing processes. This cross-sector, multi-level strategy represents the Danish government’s commitment to decreasing waste and wasteful practices by changing mindsets throughout the consumption process. And, from a policy perspective, this followed shortly on the heels of Sweden’s policies on tax breaks for repairing clothing and household items in 2016, which the government did as the first steps towards creating a circular economy. However, this idea of environmentally friendly clothing and lack of waste in the fashion economy has affected some high-profile brands. Patagonia has won the circular economy multinational award at the economic forum in 2017. If your Patagonia gear is ripped, worn, or broken, they will repair it. They want to help keep customers using their high-quality products for as long as possible. “Repair is a radical act,” their website Worn Wear states. Not only do they offer the repair service but they also offer blogs on how to extend the life of your gear and how to care for it so it won’t need to be repaired for a long, long time. Vienna’s Forward-Thinking Fashionistas Impact Hub Vienna’s social and environmental entrepreneurs are creating new brands which are sustainable and circular. If you want something fashion-forward and forward-thinking then these brands and initiatives can help you find a sustainable solution to enjoying fashion responsibly. Endlos Fesch – Vienna’s Fashion Library is the ultimate in sustainability. This pop-up library lets you rent clothes. Need a drindl for Wienner Wiesn’ Festival? No problem, you can rent one for €45 for the whole month. Need a ball gown? They have them. The founders say the library allows us all to enjoy our soft spot for fashion while keeping our environmental impacts low. MaMaMu and The Shirt System enables shoppers to mix and match various designs to create their own shirts. They have worked with artists to create a variety of eye-catching patterns which can be snapped together to make endlessly interesting designs from a few articles of clothing. Meaning your look can change but your ecological footprint doesn’t. Kindby takes the hassle out of buying environmentally friendly baby clothes when you already have so much going on. The birth of a little one can be stressful enough without having to think about how your choices for your baby’s clothes affect the environment. Every month, they put together a box of clothes from environmentally friendly producers in your baby’s size which are seasonably appropriate. They choose clothing made to last, so the next little one can wear them too. Fitico Sportswear makes all of their sportswear from recycled plastic fishing nets. They design their clothes in Austria and then they are made in Portugual. The brand is ethical from start to finish. “In all we do, we put people and planet first.” And they have you covered from head to ankles, with headbands, tops, jackets, and leggings. So, get moving with your favourite environmentally sustainable exercise and fitness clothing brand. Montreet offers so much to the environmentally minded consumer. From repairs and make-overs should the item be worn out or damaged to rentals of their clothing if you are a fair-weather climber or event only jogger. They use resource saving materials and processes to craft their fashionable sportswear and encourage consumers to purchase a single jacket to cover off every sport, weather it is climbing, jogging, cycling or other outdoor activities. New Drivers for a New Accelerator These brands all contribute to positive environmental impacts, whether it is through renting clothing or removing plastics directly from the oceans, they are all making consumers lives a little better and easing out minds. But these are well-established brands within the Impact Hub Vienna network. Some of them having been with us for years and we have watched them grow through accelerator programs and flourish in the new environmentally-conscious market place they are helping to shape. And while, they are doing their part and helping you to do yours, there are still gaps in the ethical fashion market. Impact Hub Amsterdam, supported by Impact Hub Vienna, developed a new accelerator program to facilitate new social and environmental entrepreneurs entering this market; The Fashion Accelerator for Better Business (FABB). The start-up accelerator is aimed at companies working in the Netherlands or Austria in garment production which incorporate circular economies and/or sustainability into their business models and planning and sell directly to the end consumer. This new program will be bringing new brands and entrepreneurs into the spotlight in a challenging market segment which must compete with the juggernauts in the fast fashion industry. Both Amsterdam and Vienna are placing a high degree of importance on sustainable fashion, according to the accelerator’s Netherlands counterpart, which make them the best places for new brands because of the high degree of government support for environmentally sustainable initiatives and companies. Environmental Impact and You Outside of shopping these brands and keeping tabs on the new developments from Impact Hub Vienna, what can you do? “Make and mend” is the term used in the Navy (notably Commonwealth of Nations navies) for an “afternoon off”. It is derived from the time of sailing ships when sailors would, occasionally but regularly, be allowed time to “make and mend” their uniforms. (Wikipedia) “Make Do and Mend”, which means fixing our clothing rather than throwing them out and getting something new. Patagonia offers the service at an international level for their clothing, and locally, so does Montreet. Patrick Grant, British fashion designer and owner of bespoke tailoring services in Saville row, recommends picking up a needle yourself to repair your clothes. There are so many ways to do this. If you were one of the many who took up sewing during the covid-19 precautionary measures, then you probably have learned some skills. This includes the new class of “Sew-Bros”. But if you didn’t, there are other options. The trend of visible mending is on the rise, everything from iron patches, sewn on appliques, and traditional embroidery techniques can be used to patch up a few holes and give your clothes a bit more longevity. This is an art form which used to be employed all over the world. Not confident wielding a needle at all, Vienna has a venerable tradition of tailors and dressmakers who can help you out for reasonable rates. Vienna has an excellent repair network which is featured on the European Union’s Circular Economy Stakeholder website. Or, if you happen to know a Sew-Bro or anyone else who has the confidence, offer a trade for services or teaching, just like in the repair cafes. Take conscious stock of your purchasing habits. How much clothing do you own? Do you need to buy more? Can you access a service for it instead, like Endlos Fesch? If you need to replace something, can you afford to invest in a piece you would rather care for and repair rather than something you would consider disposable? Is there a consignment shop or thrist shop option instead? We all need to ask ourselves these questions and more as we approach textile consumption. The waste is just too much to not. Pool wardrobes with friends. Sometimes, but not always, we need a suit. Sometimes, but not always, we need a ballgown. Again, Endlos Fesch and Montreet offer a library of options but what if you want something a little more permanent. My grandmother and three of her friends who were getting married in the same year and were all relatively the same size, purchased a wedding dress together. All four wore it. When my friends started having children, they decided to share the expense of maternity clothing. Sometimes closet swapping is a great way to refresh what you are wearing. No one in your office has seen your friend’s pieces. Hand me downs worked for us for years before, all of us in an older sibling’s clothing or something from one of our parent’s friend’s kids, we can do the same thing for us and our families and reduce textile waste in the process. Besides, pre-worn jeans are the best feeling ones. We are always looking for the best ways to help you create a social or environmental impact, either through our forward-thinking entrepreneurs or through savvy suggestions like the ones above. We are eagerly awaiting the new brands and entrepreneurs from the first iteration of the FABB accelerator.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/09/10/thought-provoking-podcasts-that-will-fuel-your-social-impact-aspirations/","ImpactHub","Thought-provoking Podcasts That Will Fuel Your Social Impact Aspirations","If you’re in the business of fixing the world – in other, more practical words, if you’re a social entrepreneur – you know that success doesn’t come handed on a silver platter. At times, you get tired, you run out of ideas or solutions, and the world seems like a big pile of mess that you just cannot fix. What you can do, however, is look beyond your immediate circle to the wider ecosystem. There is a wealth of knowledge out there, obtained after much trial and error. Explore other stories and let yourself be inspired by them! One of the easiest (and trendiest) ways to do that is by listening to podcasts. The wonderful thing about them is that you can basically squeeze in an episode anytime and anywhere you want to. Whether you’re lying on the couch, feeling guilty about that business plan you’ve been avoiding, or you’re bursting with motivation during your morning run, you can just put your earphones on, press play and let the voices of the people at the other end of the recording draw you in. It will almost feel like you’re being let in on a well-kept secret. So, if you are on the lookout for high-quality options, here is a list of 10 podcasts every social entrepreneur should listen to. Most of them even have a touch of Viennese Schmäh and a number of guests you may have already met at Impact Hub Vienna. Future Weekly – der Startup Podcast! Every week, Daniel Cronin and Markus Raunig take a seat in front of their mics to discuss the most interesting news and developments concerning Austrian startups, technology and the future as a whole. The topics presented in Future Weekly range from the power exerted by tech giants to the explosion of e-commerce and even the more lighthearted TikTok dilemma. Needless to say, there are plenty of lessons to learn from these experienced entrepreneurs, especially as they engage in dialogues with their Rockstars of the week – the changemakers who have excelled at bringing about a positive impact. > Listen to the Future Weekly podcast Gründer und Zünder He shares his knowledge because it brings him joy – this is how Florian (Flo) Kandler, entrepreneur, book author, “pitch doctor” and the mastermind behind Gründer und Zünder describes himself. In this podcast, he interviews startup founders, experts and investors from Austria to give you an insight into how you can build fundable companies and ensure long-term growth. If you’ve kept an eye on our community, some of the guests’ names might even strike you as familiar: Ali Mahlodji has been featured with tips on how to understand innovation and prepare a good talk; and Michael Kowatschew, the creator of the Contract Tracing App Novid-20, has recently given some practical advice on how to put together a large team in a matter of weeks. > Listen to the Gründer und Zünder podcast Inside Impact – der Podcast mit Wirkung Produced by the Social Entrepreneurship Center of WU Vienna, Inside Impact – The Podcast with Purpose focuses on four main topics: Organizational Resilience, Volunteering, Impact Investing and Social Entrepreneurship. Each of them comprises analyses of trends, developments, the difficulties one might encounter when in charge of a social impact initiative and the qualities needed to change the face of the communities we live in. With this in mind, it should not come as a surprise to you that Impact Hub Vienna is well-represented too: Lena Gansterer, our Partnerships Director, was invited to talk about how and where social impact entrepreneurs can find support for their ideas (Spoiler alert: Lindengasse 56 would be a good place to start). > Listen to the Inside Impact – der Podcast mit Wirkung podcast Thinking twice This time, sustainability is the key word. Thinking twice, the podcast hosted by Sophia Ernst, sets out to motivate listeners to start their own sustainable business by finding out about the blunders that other social impact entrepreneurs have had to overcome and the lessons they’ve learned. Whether we’re talking about fair fashion, environmentally-friendly hygiene products or the fight against plastic spoons, there are plenty of stories and initiatives for you to explore. Our personal favorites? There’s no room for debate here – Claudia Bergero and Sara Falkner, the creators of the sustainable chewing gum Alpengummi. > Listen to the Thinking twice podcast There is a wealth of knowledge out there, obtained after much trial and error. Explore other stories and let yourself be inspired by them. One of the easiest (and trendiest) ways to do that is by listening to podcasts. Carpe diem Being in charge of a team, finding investors, handling logistics, generating an actual income while saving (at least a tiny fraction of) the world, all of this can feel quite stressful at times. What you may need in order to wind down for a little is for someone to remind you this: Carpe diem. Seize the day! Daniela Zeller and Holger Potye are there to do just that. In their feel-good podcast, they sit down with a variety of people from all possible fields to help you find balance and enjoy life. Plus, they happen to have celebrated their 50th episode with a guest we believe is particularly special: Perrine Schober, the founder of the social tourism initiative Shades Tours. > Listen to the Carpe diem podcast Die Ali Mahlodji Show Yes, we’ve already mentioned his name and you know he is a cherished member of our community, but there is a reason why he is thought to be such a good speaker – he can speak. And he can also make other people speak, asking the right questions and prompting them to share their stories. In his podcast, Die Ali Mahlodji Show, Ali engages in in-depth conversations with politicians, journalists, researchers and even teenagers so as to show you that you have the power to design your own future. In case you’re wondering, we recommend that you begin exploring this podcast with Episode 15, which features DariaDaria, the best-known sustainability influencer in the German-speaking area. > Listen to the Die Ali Mahlodji Show podcast beatframes Inspiration with a parallel to media and communication: this is what Maximilian Hecke and Matthias Neumayer promise to deliver by means of their podcast beatframes. Once you’re done dancing it out on the energizing intro tune, you will discover success stories from household names such as Rainer Nowak, Matthias Strolz or Julia Dujmovits. There are special treats for social impact entrepreneurs too: Episode 26 features Philipp Stangl, who explains why weighing up on your consumption habits is worth the effort and talks about his (mouth-watering) business Rebel Meat. > Listen to the beatframes podcast Startup School Radio We’re getting a bit nostalgic with this one, as the last episode hit the podcast scene 4 years ago, but trust us, it’s worth taking a listen. Startup School Radio was a weekly podcast broadcast from the very campus of the Wharton School in San Francisco. In the 49 episodes, various partners from Y Combinator took turns to discuss the difficulties of managing a company alongside startup founders and investors. At the time, some of the initiatives presented were just taking off, but now they are well-established businesses whose strategies you will definitely want to hear about! > Listen to the Startup School Radio podcast The Tim Ferriss Show The Tim Ferriss Show has been ranked the no. 1 business podcast multiple times, so there is probably no need to introduce it anymore. There are no less than 456 episodes teeming with knowledge from personalities such as LeBron James, Jamie Foxx or Malcolm Gladwell, and the topics put forward cover everything from supporting doctors during a pandemic to writing powerful books. There is honestly little more you could ask for from a podcast, especially seeing as many of the interviews are so open and raw. > Listen to the Tim Ferriss Show podcast How I Built This We thought we might go out in style, so we picked this podcast to remind you that, whatever problem your social impact business is devoted to, you are building a movement. Produced by NPR and hosted by Guy Raz, How I Built This is all about sharing the stories of the entrepreneurs that have turned an idea, sometimes even a mistake, into a brand many of us now know or use: from Instagram to Airbnb, from Canva to Zumba, they all started out as a mere thought, were pulled back by various obstacles and yet made it to the top. Who’s to say you are not headed there as well? > Listen to the How I Built This podcast Want to go from listening to podcasts to producing your own podcast? Together with zimtfilm and Austrian Webinars, Impact Hub Vienna has prepared a web conferencing equipment offer to help you take your events online!

They were children of the Great Depression and wars which left the world resource-poor and economically damaged. Looking around the marketplace today, we see a world ravaged by a global health crisis and two successive recessions a little over a decade apart. Consumers worldwide are looking for different and more affordable solutions for their needs. Frugal Innovation sounds like something we should all be saying and here’s why. Impact Hub Vienna defines it as an innovation process resulting in “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” In essence, this means Frugal Innovations provide radically affordable products to a large number of consumers in previously untapped markets. They require gaining an in-depth understanding of the requirements of the target market to provide a product or a service that is specifically needed, with quality and cost in mind. While these innovations must keep the needs of the consumer first and foremost in their development and sales, they can also have significant impacts on the environment. Frugal Innovation in Practice Austrian companies working with partner organizations have been active in the field of Frugal Innovation for more than a decade. Helioz, founded by Martin Wesian and supported by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), provides a low-cost solar water purification system to many households throughout the continent of Africa. The company got its start after Wesian suffered from cholera while travelling in Venezuela and drinking contaminated water. He started looking for solutions and found one which was inexpensive and easily deployable, solar water disinfection. Now his UV measurement device is used in households across Uganda and Kenya to provide safe drinking water. They work with designers and social scientists, at home and abroad, to ensure their products are adopted by the largest number of households in their target markets. It should be noted, not every solution in the field of Frugal Innovations requires advanced engineering knowledge. Bosnia Grows Organic has been leasing land from Bosnian families to grow organic medicinal herbs. The team cleared the debris from unused arable land and took soil samples to determine what herbs would best grow in specific locations. The project, also funded by the ADA, came about after Ivana Stjepanovic had a discussion with her sisters about returning to Bosnia and their memories of organic farming before the country was torn apart by war. The company aims to return the land to the families after the end of the lease, more valuable than when they received it; creating farmable land once more. The project wants to help Bosnia develop economically by providing help and expertise to support what was once a flourishing organic farming industry. And, with the help of Austrian organic farmers, they are doing just that. Frugal Innovation as the Answer to Consumer Demands for Affordable Quality Products In the current economic climate of high job losses and the threat of whole sectors of economies going under, Frugal Innovation can and must apply globally. In the article “Relevanz und Potenziale frugaler Innovationen für Österreich” the authors, Rajnish Tiwari, Stephan Buse, Katharina Kalogerakis, Jakob Scheitza and Cornelius Herstatt, as the title suggests, discuss the relevance of Frugal Innovation for Austria, from the perspective of selling to the Austrian consumer and abroad. Their example is older consumers and technology. “Many users, especially senior citizens, feel overwhelmed by the (avoidable) hyper-complexity of technical solutions. They desire simpler and more robust products, and see the practice of planned obsolescence skeptically”, the authors state. This statement applies to any consumer who does not want to spend money on the latest cell phone model, regardless of the size of the marketing campaign and has managed their fears of missing out. Other consumers “are utilizing frugal products and business models (…) there is a growing trend in certain sections of the society for voluntary simplicity and more moderate lifestyles”. In other words, there is an emerging consumer who would like to spend less and save more but still have access to quality products. And in still another case, there is the conscious consumer who wants something affordable, durable, and of high quality to last several years so they are not substantially increasing their ecological footprint with the purchase of a new product. It is through these consumers that the authors of this article specifically tie in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), “ecological considerations necessitate a significant reduction in the consumption of finite and depleting natural resources, globally. Engaging in frugal innovations, therefore, contributes positively to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals”. What does all this mean for a social entrepreneur, the SME, the tech-savvy start-up, or the subject matter expert? Well, it means new markets are developing both locally and abroad. Consumer profiles are changing and entrepreneurs from Austria and the Western Balkans are well-placed to break onto the scene with novel solutions, inside and outside their borders. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by ADA and FFG to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. Implementing partner Impact hub Vienna is organizing three online information sessions on October 8, October 29, and November 19, 2020, for organizations and individuals who would like to learn more about the project. Each of the three events focuses on one theme that was selected after a series of interviews with stakeholders from the Western Balkans and Austria. Join the online information sessions to learn about frugal innovation and its potential for the region, find out more about the project and funding opportunities, ask questions to representatives of ADA and FFG, get feedback on your project ideas, and network with potential partners in Austria and the Western Balkans.

So much so that the popular English newspaper The Guardian adopted an updated set of terms to better reflect the gravity and the urgency of the situation. Indeed, they are suggesting to refer to it not as ‘climate change’ but instead ‘climate crisis’ or ’emergency’. Emphasizing the myriad of evidence proving it, they are calling those who are opposing the human role in the process ‘climate deniers’ and not ‘skeptics’. Still, with an abundance of information about climate change’s economic and ecological effects, there is somehow an overlooked aspect of the current climate emergency: its social impact and the fact that it most affects already disadvantaged segments of the society. Many experts agree that those especially vulnerable to climate change are the people who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized. In other words, those same people who have least contributed to climate change in the first place. Numbers can help put things into perspective: according to Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index, 33 countries are labeled under the extreme risk category. 27 out of these 33 countries are located on the African continent. When we compare the risk levels on a regional scale the picture gets even clearer. Europe and North America are getting the lowest risk scores, 8.13 and 7.81 consecutively (10 being the lowest risk and 0 being the highest), while Africa (2.89) leads the high-risk-region league with a significant margin to its closest successor Central America(4.05), followed by the Caribbean and Oceania, consequently. Climate Change Vulnerability Index 2017, Source The contrast is stark considering that North America is home to only 5% of the world population but emits nearly 18% of CO2 while Africa, for instance, has 16% of the population but emits just 4% of CO2. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the citizens of the developed countries will be safe from harm or won’t be affected by the negative effects of climate change. Studies suggest that even in industrialized and wealthy countries climate change will reinforce inequalities within the society. If anything, this index proves that the burden and the responsibility to stop this crisis and find solutions to mitigate its effects rely mainly on the shoulders of the high- and upper-middle-income countries. Returning to our main subject, the social impacts of climate change can be better understood by analyzing various topics individually. The following paragraphs will cover the risks and challenges the climate change poses on: health systems, food security, employment, gender equality, and education. Health and Nutrition Besides the direct hazardous effects of climate change such as heatwaves, floods, and storms, it is also expected that it will inevitably affect, via more complex pathways, the basic requirements for maintaining good health: access to clean air and water, the procurement of sufficient food and adequate shelter and freedom from disease. It is indeed suggested by the World Health Organization(WHO), that in the long run, the greatest health impacts may not be from acute shocks of natural disasters or epidemics, but from the gradual build-up of pressure on the natural, economic and social systems that sustain health, and which are already under stress in much of the developing world. “To understand the kind of damage that climate change will inflict, look at COVID-19 and spread the pain out over a much longer period.” – Bill Gates Just like the COVID-19 pandemic we’re experiencing nowadays, the health effects of climate change are expected to be more severe for elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Children and women living in poor countries are also in the high-risk category. To draw attention to the ruinous effects of climate change and its repercussions on health, Bill Gates makes a striking comparison in his personal blog Gates Notes, between COVID-19 and climate change, and claims that it will hurt the poorest people in the world the most. He even suggests that “[t]he loss of life and economic misery caused by this pandemic are on par with what will happen regularly if we do not eliminate the world’s carbon emissions. Strongly connected with the subject of health and not less important is the topic of nutrition. According to OXFAM, a confederation of 20 independent charitable organizations focusing on poverty eradication, already 60 million people around the globe are facing a food crisis. Currently not getting the public attention it deserves, this problem is only destined to worsen in the following decades unless drastic measures are taken no later than today. For instance, droughts, as a result of extended periods of decreased precipitation, combined with other extreme weather events, are causing the loss of livelihoods and devastation of harvests, leaving local residents with a dilemma: leaving in search of other livelihood opportunities or staying and facing hunger. Another direct consequence of these events is food price spikes which are evident to have dramatic effects on low-income families and individuals on a global scale. Prices of some of the most essential crops such as rice, wheat, and maize are estimated to increase by up to %150 by 2060. Employment The negative impact of climate change on employment is expected to be on various levels. Once again, these effects will be particularly harsh for some regions and economic sectors as well as for some portions of the society. Both in urban and rural labor markets, extreme weather events are likely to cause job losses. As a result of this and assuming a global temperature rise of 1.5°C by the end of the twenty-first century, the International Labor Organization(ILO) estimates a global productivity loss equivalent to the loss of an astonishing 80 million full-time jobs as early as 2030. In terms of financial loss, this equals US$2,400 billion, an almost ninefold increase from the previous projection of US$280 billion made in 1995. ILO experts also underline the fact that this is rather a conservative estimate as some climate scientists even predict temperature rises by as much as 3 degrees Celsius for the same time period. The ILO report titled “Working on a warmer planet: The impact of heat stress on labor productivity and decent work” further suggests that the sectors most affected by the rising temperatures will be the agricultural and construction sectors as workers in these sectors are highly exposed to outdoor work. Other sectors highly dependent on natural resources and climate such as energy, tourism, and transport sectors are also to suffer the consequences of climate change. Geographically, the ILO report suggests that the most seriously affected regions will be southern Asia and western Africa, while European subregions are expected to experience a smaller impact. This inevitably brings a further widening of the inequality gap between low and high-income countries. Furthermore, ILO points out the high impact risks on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to their vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. On the other hand, the adaptation policies to reduce climate vulnerability may have the potential to create positive effects and stimulate demand for labor. In their guide titled “Adaptation to Climate Change and the World Of Work”, the European Trade Union Confederation(ETUC) brings attention to the benefits of the adaptation policies. These policies, according to ETUC, may contribute to preserving existing jobs and stimulate demand for labor and for new types of goods and services. Depending on the average annual spending on adaptation measures for EU countries, such implementation could lead to the creation of between 500,000 to one million direct and indirect jobs in 2050. July2014, Assessing the Implications of Climate Change Adaptation on Employment in the EU. SourceGender Equality The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges that disasters affect men and women differently on a number of levels, including economically, socially, psychologically, and in terms of exposure to risk and risk perception. (link) The experts, however, seem to agree on the fact that there is a need for further research on this subject and draw attention to gender aspects being generally neglected in international climate policy. Another important point to be kept in mind on the subject of gender equality is that gender norms and values are not fixed and evolve over time. This means the adverse health consequences resulting from gender differences and gender inequalities evolve as well. Women are often considered to be more vulnerable to climate change than men. Sometimes this is due to gender norms in a particular society that dictate acceptable behaviors for men and women. An example of this can be found in some Latin American and Asian countries, where women and girls are often not taught to swim for reasons of modesty, making their chances of survival in flooding disasters significantly lower. DW reports that, according to a UN Population Fund report, women and girls are 14 times more likely to die than men during natural disasters. In most cases, however, it is their lower socioeconomic status in the society that makes women more vulnerable. They make up the majority of the world’s economically poor, doing most of the agricultural work, bearing unequal responsibility for household food security, carrying a disproportionate burden for harvesting water and fuel for everyday survival, and relying on threatened natural resources for their livelihoods. Not to mention their lack of access, control, and ownership of these resources and their exclusion from important policy-making processes. Education There is strong evidence suggesting it is children who will be hit the hardest by the effects of climate change. In its publication titled “Our climate, our children, our responsibility”, UNICEF UK draws attention to the detrimental effects of climate change on livelihoods. Some of these effects, the publication suggests, may make it more likely that parents remove their children from school – and in most cultures, this will almost certainly mean removing girls first – so that they can work to supplement household income. Another possible outcome is that entire families may need to migrate in search of food, water, and employment, pulling their kids out of school. “Indian women born during a drought or a flood in the 1970s were 19 percent less likely to attend primary school when compared with women the same age who were not affected by natural disasters.” – Human Development Report 2007–2008 The physical harm brought by extreme weather events on the educational infrastructure is, of course, another challenge that needs to be addressed. ‘Climate change proofing’ of educational infrastructure seems like the most logical first step in that regard. Climate proofing is defined as, “(…) the explicit consideration and internalization of the risks and opportunities that alternative climate change scenarios are likely to imply for the design, operation and maintenance of infrastructure. In other words, integrating climate change risks and opportunities into the design, operation, and management of infrastructure.” in the UNDP report “Paving the Way for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure”. Local Perspective: Climate Change in Austria Since the mid-nineteenth century, records indicate an increase in the average annual temperature in Austria of about 2°C. Compared with a global increase of 0.85°C for the same time period and considering that approximately half of that increase is recorded after 1980, it is clear that Austria is among the countries most affected by climate change in Europe and also on the global scale. This is also reflected in Germanwatch’s Global Climate Risk Index(CRI) 2020 report, where Austria is ranked as the 10th country in Europe and overall 49th among the 183 countries that most suffer from the negative consequences of extreme weather events. The index, developed by Germanwatch, combines the impact of extreme weather events both in terms of fatalities and economic losses. Given experts’ expectations towards further temperature increases in Austria in the following decades, the already substantial economic and social impacts of climate change seem destined to grow. The Austrian Assessment Report on Climate Change, published in 2014, draws attention to this fact stating that “(i)n addition to extreme events, gradual temperature and precipitation changes also have economic ramifications, such as shifts in potential yields in agriculture, in the energy sector, or in snow-reliability in ski areas with corresponding impacts on winter tourism.” (link) The report also warns against the risk of significant increases in events such as landslides, mudflows, and rockfalls in mountainous regions as well as the reduction in surface area of glaciers in Austria. After Us, the Flood Illustrating the complex correlations of the climate crisis through photography and video, Kunst Haus Wien, which holds the honor of being Vienna’s first green museum, hosts the exhibition titled ‘After Us, the Flood'(Nach Uns die Sintflut) until February 21, 2021. Featuring 21 Austrian and international artists, the exhibition shows the ecological consequences of our growth-orientated economic system at the global level and highlights the need for urgent sustainable action. One of those artists is the young Iranian photographer Solmaz Daryani, who through her photograph series ‘The Eyes of Earth(THE DEATH OF LAKE URMIA)‘, ongoing since the year 2014, documents the vanishing of the largest lake in the Middle East with its repercussions on agriculture and tourism, of which many inhabitants of the region depend upon. Another artist, Angela Tiatia, in her twenty-minute film ‘Tuvalu‘, shows some of the daily effects of rising sea levels on Tuvalu, a low-lying island in the Pacific. This small island represents many others facing to be overcome by the rising sea levels, as people in different parts of the world continue to produce waste and live unsustainably, unaware of the severe effects of these actions on their neighbors in the Pacific. Also in the context of the exhibition, there will be special events such as guided tours, reading classes, and an open-to-public panel named ‘Future Talks’, where experts, artists, and activists will discuss the relationship between climate and various topics such as the economy, legislation, and fossil fuels. The Cure for Climate Change: Does It Exist? Luckily, not all predictions are pessimistic: according to the Austrian Assessment Report on Climate Change mentioned earlier, various scenario simulations show that emission reductions of up to 90% can be achieved in Austria by 2050 through the implementation of additional measures. This, however, seems only possible with what is described as a social-ecological transformation, a paradigm shift in the prevailing consumption and behavior patterns, and in the traditional short-term oriented policies and decision-making processes. An essential part of this transformation will be the establishment of new business and financing models, promoting environmentally sustainable development, and a circular economy. Therefore, the thing that is missing is not a cure for injustices and inequalities brought by climate change. We already have the cure in our hands. Indeed, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), contained within The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, already provides the blueprint for a prosperous and peaceful future. But instead, what is missing is the will to put theory into practice. A roaring pressure from the silent masses which will force politicians and big corporations to put things in the right perspective. The real question now is, whether we will achieve that before it is too late.

BauKarussell – a RE:WIEN 2019 accelerator program alumnus – was awarded third place in the competition. BauKarussell (c) OekoBusiness Wien – Frank HelmrichBauKarussell made it into three award-winning projects out of 73 submissions for the Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize 2020. During the pitching event, which took place mid-September, Markus Meissner (pulswerk; Resource Manager and head of BauKarussell) presented the social urban mining concept to a jury panel of European experts. BauKarussell was awarded third place and granted with 10,000 euros as prize money. ‘The Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize raises awareness of the essential role small start-ups play in making the circular economy a reality. The award shows that other experts confirm our idea,’ says Meissner. The award was announced by EIT RawMaterials. EIT RawMaterials (initiated and financed by the EIT – European Institute of Innovation and Technology – of the EU) is the world’s largest consortium in the raw materials sector. The competition was organised in collaboration with ICLEI, RREUSE and POP UP (Veolia), with the aim of finding top innovators working on new business models that promote the repair, reuse and sharing of products as an essential part of the circular economy. The ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) network https://iclei.org/en/Home.html promotes sustainable development at the local level; the City of Vienna is also involved in the ICLEI-led initiatives of the EU Commission, the “Big Buyers Initiative”. Taking this into consideration, BauKarussell shares common interests with the organisations of the competition and receiving the prize is all the more important. First place of the Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize went to Thrifify (digital second-hand trading platform for charitable organizations, Ireland), while the second prize was given to Tournevie (development of the circular material hub Tourneville, Brussels). The implementation of social urban mining requires strong partnerships. BauKarussell therefore invites project developers to consider implementing social urban mining in their projects. BauKarussell sifts through local social economy companies in the vicinity of the construction project and works with them in a potential analysis on how project development increases cost-neutral resource efficiency, promotes circular economy and, at the same time, creates important jobs for the disadvantaged groups in our society.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/10/21/circular-food-management-in-the-urban-regions-of-austria/","ImpactHub","Circular Food Management in the Urban Regions of Austria","Food waste is one of the most pressing problems of our time. Especially within cities, the disposing of food, that would have still been edible, is a common concern. However, what if food waste could become a resource? Circular economy models promise that the loop of nutrients related to the food system could be closed and the cycle of matter can be partially closed, depending on the reuse of food. These circular models involve an enhancement or renewal of our current linear systems. Where do we start with implementing a resource recovery-focused approach? Begin with supporting local food systems as they have strong potential for increased environmental sustainability through nutrient cycling and waste reduction. Strengthening local and seasonal elements in short-supply chains, reduces storage and transportation times resulting in less waste and a lower carbon footprint. Austrian start-ups participating in the 5th edition of RE:WIEN, such as deli*MAT and Fine Food For Busy People are committed to making fresh, sustainable and local food more accessible, in quantities we need instead of overbuying; Bienen-Retter Honig is dedicated to organic food production and biodiversity protection; and 2nd chance cereal is giving unsold bread a second chance. Let’s Talk Numbers Approximately 30%–50% of food intended for human consumption is wasted at different stages of the food system, such losses might be due to storage, transportation, processing, packaging and sorting in the agricultural operation and on the market (Felicitas Schneider, Lebensmittel im Abfall – mehr als eine technische Herausforderung). Food waste causes around 8% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions and is responsible for 70% of the fresh water consumption. In Austria, up to 521,000 tons of edible food is thrown away annually. On average, the Viennese throw away around 40 kilograms of food each year that could have been eaten. These numbers show an inefficiency in the food economy, where the consequences are a loss of energy, biodiversity, natural resources, productivity and money, and not to forget about the pollution and greenhouse gases that are created as a result of these processes. The WWF views food waste as one of the greatest ecological threats for this planet and calls for actions to be taken, for food wastage to be reduced by 2030. What is Circular Economy and How Can it Help Manage Food Matters? Circular Economy applies the theory and principles from industrial ecology, which aims to close the loop of substances and materials to consequently reduce both resource consumption and discharges into the environment. Circular economy intends to optimize and enhance the systems by reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products. That which was regarded as waste – becomes a resource. Circular Food Management refers to the circular economy that is most concerned with the management of the food system. This involves the reduction of waste generated in the food system, re-use of food, utilization of food waste and by-products, nutrient recycling, and changes in diet toward more diverse and more efficient food patterns. Image Source: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation As far as we know, the loop of nutrients related to the food system can be closed and the loop of matter can be partly closed relating to the reuse of food, and the utilization of by-products and waste. To avoid food waste, all the different stages of the food system must be considered, and measures must be adopted by the producers, distributors as much as by the consumers. Urban Regions as Catalysts in Changing the Food System Looking back a century the amount of waste produced in Vienna was quite limited and stable, compared to today’s standards. Food was often kept for longer or reused for later meals. However, as times have changed, the world population is growing and more people are moving to live in the cities, the amounts of waste levels have been steadily increasing. The high proportion of the food that flows into cities is processed or consumed in a way that creates organic waste in the form of discarded food, by-products or sewage, endangering human health and leads to a loss in biodiversity. Cities, as core population, innovation and development centres, bear the responsibility to minimise food waste as they have the resources and infrastructure to do it. The rising population leads to a greater demand for food and higher consumption rates in cities, which our current model for managing food no longer fits. Every action is needed to minimize food waste. “Cities, as core population, innovation and development centres, bear the responsibility to minimise food waste as they have the resources and infrastructure to do it.” This contribution could start by supporting local food systems as they have strong potential for increased environmental sustainability through nutrient cycling and waste reduction. Local food is not only fresher, but more regenerative and balanced, as it combines local and seasonal elements in short-supply chains – reducing storage and transportation, while providing better demand-supply balance. Strengthening localized food systems is a significant contribution to food waste prevention, food security and sustainability. Austrian Startups That Embrace Food Circularity deli*MAT, led by Karsten Michael Drohsel and Irene Lucas, is a start-up that produces solar vending machines, which are placed throughout Vienna as street furniture, and stocked with products from small local food producers. “The daily experience of poor local supply with high-quality and healthy products from small producers made us rethink. Especially local and regional food providers are particularly close to our hearts, i.e. smaller neighborhood shops that have/have had a particularly difficult time surviving during the corona pandemic. We want to encourage local and national consumers to develop sustainable and social awareness and to support local providers and their shops in their everyday lives.” The project is framed by a comprehensive educational program, which Karsten and Irene are currently developing and doing in Sandleitenhof (16. district).

Our contribution to reducing food waste is portioned food and intelligent forecast AI models that enables us to learn taste patterns of offices. This enables us to minimize out of stock and overstock,” commented Stephan Haymerle, the founder of the venture. All food that is not sold is donated as portioned food to charity organizations. Kantines will throw away a ton of food every day to avoid going out of stock – we use every dish for our customers or charity.” If you like it sweet, you might like to support the regional organic honey seller Bienen-Retter Honig (behind which stands a large team of Marian Aschenbrenner, Nalini Basedow, Sophia Rut, Christiane Aschauer, and Martin Manyet) that puts their sales back into maintaining the organic honey production, as well as the protection of wild bees.

Photo by Lea Fabienne for RE:WIEN 2020Another way to contribute to food waste reduction is to give food a second chance like the start-up 2nd chance cereal does. Sarah Lechner and Michael Berger produce granola made from unsold bread to reduce land use, water consumption, emissions and improve food availability by reducing food waste. Sarah Lechner & Michael Berger. Photo by Lea Fabienne for RE:WIEN 2020“It all started one afternoon in late 2019,” reminiscence Sarah and Berger .Sitting together with our son Luca, playing a game naming food made from cereal, he claimed that cereals are made from bread, which was obviously not true at that time. Later that day a long forgotten line came up to our minds. Vienna is disposing as much bread as Graz consumes. Several months later we launched 2nd chance cereals in the Austrian market. The Granola is currently handmade in the 10. district of Vienna, while the bread comes from the bakery Geier.” The Future of Circular Food Systems Startups such as the aforementioned, are enhancing the current management of food and are working towards implementing resilient food systems, leading the way towards a change at the local/regional level. If we make use of food waste as a resource to grow food and understand it as a precious asset, we can cut costs, prevent energy loss and reduce the carbon footprint.

Ten years seems a short time, yet peculiarly long, when we rekindle all those memories of transformation, ideas that have evolved and people’s lives that have been impacted in subtle, amazing ways. To highlight one such transformational story, I had to interview Theresa Imre, the founder of markta, a quickly growing digital farmers market that combines the rural supply of high quality sustainable food from the farmers with the flexible urban demand created by us the chic and trendy consumers. markta was part of one of the accelerator programs (innovate4nature) at Impact Hub Vienna and has recently developed as a wildly successful brand through the pandemic as people moved to the online market to virtually shop for their groceries. This is an alternative option for the supermarket-goers; specifically to get their food fresh from the farm and a push towards a growing community of people who love sustainable food that in turn empowers the farmers. You can read more about story leading up to me discovering markta, finding out how we shared a rooted cause oceans away and my fun experience meeting Theresa in this blog article. I’ll directly take you now in this article to the venue, amidst the lively and chatty bars of the dimly lit and often chippering Yppenplatz square, as me and Theresa are sipping our fresh spritzers. Now hold on tight, Acio! The Early Days Stanish: So Theresa, where did this all start, why do you feel like you want to make an impact? Theresa: I was actually living in the countryside, living around farms and was used to how people produce food in a natural way. But that is just one part relating to my roots; the other part relating to my heart, my energy and my motivation is that I never understood why as a child I had all this education, food and everything while so many people did not have access to all that and this gave me a clear and naïve perspective at a very young age. I realized that I wanted to make an impact, and spend my lifetime with leading a change. That was my big motivation for being an entrepreneur and doing business. That is why I went to business school did business administration and then followed that with economics with the understanding that “I needed to grasp the structure at first and then I could change something, not the other way around.” A lot of people feel something in the world is going wrong, but not a lot of people have concrete actions on how to change that system. That is something that shaped me from very early on, that I always wanted to just make things happen. Photo by Anna ZoraPhoto by Pamela Rußmann Are you a careful person? (Almost instantaneously) I think a lot, I would say I am a thought-through person but not so much a careful person. “I think you need to try and fail otherwise you are not going to learn fast enough.” Talking about failure, who is part of your support system? Most definitely family, the closer part of my family. The tougher things get, even leading to certain parts of anxiety, the smaller group gets you. In terms of friends, I have a few, and you need that back up knowing whatever goes wrong there are these people out there. I love your urge to address problems, was there a reason why you chose this very specific cause among all the problems our society is facing? Food is just so easy for everybody to understand. It’s about sustainable consumption and how we shape our future when we are deciding what we consume and what we do not. Food is something that everybody has to buy, or grow or digest every day. We just have to have food! So in my thinking it’s a basic thing to start with. Food is so much easier for everyone to understand and also there is a big problem surrounding it and especially in Austria. Because of the big structures of the supermarkets and industries, many small family farms are not able to survive with the price pressure. Agriculture changed within the last 40 years. Farming was initially very family- oriented and provided for the villages locally. This trend however has been on a decline for example, in the last 30 years, the number of farms in Austria has reduced from 400. 000 to 160,000. That is when I realized, ‘Nay-nay-nay-nay we have to change something’. Big industries earn 80 percent and the farmers get 20 percent, and from a calculation basis, if a farmer sells an apple to the supermarket he just gets an approximate 18 cents, and there you can already see this big gap of difference. A farmer earns for the entire span of an animal as much as 6 euros sometimes, and all of the efficiency oriented approaches which the industry has been promoting has resulted in that the farmer has become the weakest link in the entire food production chain. And you are right there Theresa, the farmer is the weakest link in our society. It is great that your idea seeks to empower them. Going back to the early days, the starting phase that shaped you, who were the mentors supporting you? I worked in a business consultancy before, which helped me gain an insight into how other companies worked. I worked there for about four years, and that is where I learnt how you get have funding, how the business model is developed. We were specializing in consulting startups. That was quite a good start for me in my business career on how to set up a company. And both my bosses invested in me, in markta and that was something that has pushed me very often and I was quite happy they recognised my energy and my eagerness. Photo by Lukas Ilgner Theresa, what do you think is one thing your bosses would say about you if I met them.. I think they would be quite proud and they are fascinated about the network and reach that I grew. On the other hand, I knew that I needed a lot more expertise in management, for example, since I had never managed people, but that is something you need to learn on the way and on the go. I think your talent is a combination of what you bring to life in a certain way with what just comes naturally to you, how easily you can pick up stuff that is important to learn and understand, and how some other things should be done by other people because you yourself can’t do those things. So both of my bosses are pushing me in terms of management. So you’re still in constant touch, I find that invaluable, you apprear to have crafted your own role in markta… Yes we have a good board that supports me and of course there is my markta team. As a founder, I do the ping pong, managing the team, and thinking strategically with the board and other stakeholders. One of the other challenges I have to take up is financing that has always been a big thing especially in Austria and especially when you want to do something sustainable. Seems to me you’re a working link between the ideation and execution… I see myself as a communicator, I really believe that my biggest skill is communicating and talking to everyone on one level because at times it can really happen that sometimes I am at the farm with the farmers and then I am at Hofburg meeting the President on the same day. And this is also because women are lacking on panels, especially focusing on agriculture and IT, which are particularly male dominated. Impact Hub Vienna Days That’s true but it looks like things are slowly changing. So how did then Impact Hub Vienna come into the picture? They actually had a program called innovate4nature in collaboration with the WWF where the topic was biodiversity. Oh, where Lena Gansterer was part of the jury panel? We had talked briefly and she mentioned she coached and worked with markta. Yes and the nice thing was that five of the startups that participated received coaching and mentoring and that is what I did at Impact Hub Vienna then, when I was still in the process of developing the markta idea. We were still developing between 2016 and 2018, and through this program we had a lot of coaching especially in business modelling and finding the right finance partners. We had the concept of marketing and brand feel all figured out by then, which was in fact one of the first things, since that aspect comes naturally to me. I must say I do like the brand design appeal, it was also one of the first things I had noticed. Theresa, what was one thing probably different that you felt being in a place like Impact Hub Vienna with you being exposed a lot to the startup industry already… I know the startup sphere of Austria, this sphere is very often focussed on short term business modelling and an exit focus where everyone thinks I need to build up a bubble and somebody else is going to invest into that and things like that. At Impact Hub Vienna I felt that it was truly something much more on the ground, in terms of, “let’s really make some change” and let’s create business models that are not just there in order to gain more investors and make more profit. Impact Hub is really completely different in that focus. I think social entrepreneurship has a key role to play. And I think social entrepreneurship also includes environmental entrepreneurship. I knew about Impact Hub Vienna and I also knew about the workshops it was providing and it was very welcoming and open. Impact Hub is also welcoming people who are not in their programs because you can just rent a desk or be part of a program or in general just join certain evening events and be part of the community, for anyone who wants to be in that area. Photo by Stefan Diesner Right, and how was the growth of markta during this period because this was right after the initial development phase so there were newer frontiers to look at… I would say we did a lot of interviews at the farms and then we saw the chance with the digitalization of these processes. That’s where, even in the beginning, I already saw that my biggest impact would be, with helping those small family farms become more professional and have more efficient ways to sell their food. I felt like it was the empowerment of the farmers and that was the motivation for me thinking, ‘Hey, you can free all the farmers’. And businesswise it is a niche area: connecting farmers to people digitally… It is a niche area, yes, with the people involved. This concept involves the food that we all eat and impacts the way the farmers produce this food. And the people I met at the Hub, even though you are not closely working with them, like Lena Gangsterer, Christoph Richter, they just stick, they just have the same heart beat in terms of the direction it beats. In a sense, we are all there and we are all working on something great together. Lena did mention you as a “True entrepreneur”… What I understand, the mentorship in terms of the business to sharpen the vision and execution was an impact from the Impact Hub Vienna. Definitely as well, I would say we were doing the program and it made me refine my business model and made me question the small things. The real acceleration we had was during the pandemic. And something I learnt a little after the encounter with Impact Hub Vienna is that we met the needs of the producers and not of the consumers in terms of timely delivery, packing and nobody did this fulfilment in between. We started to draw concepts with 45 farmers to set up a fulfilment structure for farmers where we got funding from the EU for that and we built up an entire logistic system to enable our own fulfilment process and that was our big breakthrough. So we selected 100 farmers around Vienna and also for the special products, like bread and vegetables in a circle of 50 km, and we set up a system where all producers deliver between 5–7am in the early morning and on the same day we are packing the goods and delivering them to reach in the afternoon. I would say this is our biggest innovation with our just-in-time principle. A lot is thrown out in the evening in the supermarkets, and by proactively ordering from the producers, only what the consumer orders each day is harvested by the producers in the night. We only order from the producer only what consumers ordered. This reduces the huge waste that happens in supermarkets. There is this one statistic that Vienna throws away as much bread every evening as Graz actually needs. It is just cheaper for industries to produce more food and throw it away rather than not stocking and preserving it. That’s a good innovation, It sounds to me similar to what Uber tried to do in the automotive industry… I think Impact Hub Vienna provided me the metrics and tools in order to measure the impact, and that has really helped me. There is, for example, Werner Krendl, who told me about the impact framework, with IRIS from the GIIN that explains how you actually define and measure your impact because impact is such a vague word. So these are tools that really helped me present better in front of the impact investors as I got challenged with questions. Hat of Spontaneity with Theresa Hey Theresa, your documentary is going to air in a bit, how about a quick rapid fire? Yes! (And very exuberantly) Values and virtues from Impact Hub Vienna… Combination of ideology and feasibility. One thing you are grateful for… Understanding that I have so much to give, it fosters all my energy, I feel as a thankful child. markta in the future… Revolutionize the entire world food structure. We have a franchise concept, and we want to provide an operational logistics concept. Farmers are everywhere, we just need to connect them better. Role of a global network in going international… Definitely these structures will help a lot. Knowing all of this, is there anything you would have done better… Many things of course, thank god! Otherwise I would not have learnt. There are so many “this little thing” that I will do better next time. How you see Impact Hub Vienna… A nest you can get back to. Any questions on sustainability it is a go to place. Why the name ‘markta’? It is actually ‘Market’ in German, but sounds like a woman. It took me 8 weeks to think about the name. We had other names like pro-local before, describing what it actually meant. I was always thinking how it would work internationally, and really in the shower one night, as I was thinking that I needed something easy, and something everyone remembers, it hit me and there it was! It was initially for a woman who could as well be in the market and one who could represent us. But it is the many we stand for and not just the one and that is why now we have a picture of the producers to represent us. Do you value diversity in the company? At certain stages we had more people from all round the world than just from here, but diversity for me is not just where you are from, but also gender, which comes naturally as a woman in the business, and sexual orientation. We have a drag queen in our team and we are very transparent about it. Diversity also in terms of personality, I wouldn’t want employees who are all like me. Thank you for your time, Theresa! Photo by Jenn and The CameraThere are often times you’d hear about a good idea and then there are times you’d meet an idea and you feel somethings going to be changed because the people behind are willing to go the mile to make it happen. Approach is something that counts and as I was on the tram heading back to my apartment scrolling through the documentary of Theresa, I pondered this was perhaps the one thing that has driven Markta’s growth and I scribbled a note to myself to keep in touch with Theresa and follow Markta’s story and order my first groceries online!","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stefan-Diesner-1-600x400.jpeg","October 27, 2020","en",0.995351195335388,0.0756178330921102,0.339089918881655,0.126884840748971,0.458407420199364

This is a climate action slogan. A reminder that we have only this one earth. This perfect planet which grows our food, gives us water, and even manufacturers the air we breathe. This is it. And we are quickly destroying it. Plastic fills our oceans. There will soon be more of it than fish. Cities are so polluted landmarks are not visible any longer. This is our everyday reality and it isn’t getting better. Frugal innovations are inherently environmentally sustainable. Environmental concerns in emerging economies are fuelling more frugal innovations. Whether it is a product or a process, frugal innovation is changing our relationships to the environment for the better. Impact Hub Vienna defines Frugal Innovation as an innovation process resulting in “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” The relationship between frugal innovation and environmental sustainability is directly stated in the definition. If fewer resources are used to make a product or as a result of a service then, in some measure, the product or process is more environmentally sustainable. As Mathias Weichhart from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) said, using frugal innovation automatically makes something sustainable because less resources are used when focusing on the features that are really needed. This is a bold statement which also happens to be true. The scientific and sociological literature is actually very clear on the real and strong partnership between frugal innovation and environmental sustainability, it is even considered “straightforward” by some scholars. So, let’s look at some examples locally and globally where companies are using frugal innovations and increasing their positive environmental impact. Environmental Impacts Stemming Directly from Frugal Innovations Companies the world over, from global furniture giants to Vienna’s own local clothing makers are using frugal innovations. One of the easiest and most visible environmental impacts is waste reduction. It is measurable and visible. Frugal innovations help companies save money by reducing resources used and waste outputs. One of the best examples of frugal innovation in media is Ikea. The Swedish furniture manufacturer has been changing their packaging, products, and shipping processes over the last decade so that there are less resources used and less waste. One of the biggest changes and one of their most famous frugal innovations was the shift from the Expedit shelves to the Kallax. The Expedit was known for its square shelves and chunky frame. But that required a lot of wood for the veneers and chipboard construction. But it also needed a lot of cardboard for the packaging, which meant a lot of consumer waste. Ikea designers removed a few centimeters from the chunky frame, making essentially the same product (just a bit shorter and thinner). The thinner shelves enabled them to use less wood, which saved on material costs (fewer trees were cut down for the wood and to make the cardboard). Considering Ikea uses over 1% of the world’s wood supply, this is significant. But there was still more cost saving (and environmental impacts) to be had. Ikea was able to reduce its shipping carbon footprint as the smaller design meant more Kallax shelves could be shipped at one time. It is amazing the savings, both fiscally and environmentally, the reduction of a centimeter or two can make. Waste reduction immediately brings to mind consumer waste, like fast fashion and electronics. Circular economies are a frugal innovation and a waste reduction process. Companies can expend fewer resources fixing something rather than designing and shipping an entirely new line. And consumers get to keep a product they love and save money at the same time through repair rather than purchasing new. It can be difficult to innovate clothing. A t-shirt is a t-shirt, after all, the design hasn’t changed since 1898. So sometimes, it is about using frugal innovations to create new consumer services. Montreet, one of Impact Hub Vienna’s own, and Patagonia both offer repair services for their clothing. Reducing consumer waste by extending the longevity of products. Not a hiker but your company is doing team building on a trail? Montreet also offers rentals of its clothing. This circular economy approach is a great example of frugal innovation being applied to a business model. The service saves the consumer money and prevents clothing waste from ending up in a landfill. Environmental Drivers for Change Some companies start out with an environmental problem. Like Green Watech, Salma Bouagarrani looked at her home country and saw environmental devastation and a lack of clean drinking water as a result. So, she decided to do something about it, she worked with partners to create a low-tech and low-cost filtration methodology which uses materials from the region. The system is accessible and maintainable. It is used to filter the water for 10,000 homes currently and they are expanding. Coal is used to power sugar production in some of the world’s developing economies, and these countries are often the most polluted. The sugar cane is harvested and the leaves and stalks are burnt in the field to make the sugar more accessible. Then the sugar is processed in coal burning plants. The minds behind The Cane Trash Burner offer inexpensive (relatively) factory retrofits to enable producers to burn the biomass for production energy. The companies doing the processing do not have to purchase coal, saving money, and do not have to use it, saving the environment. Additionally, the biomass from the leaves and stalks is technically renewable as they will be continually growing more. While this process doesn’t eliminate carbon emissions it certainly reduces them significantly. However, sometimes frugal innovations can be applied broadly, from medicine to farming. AfroBodies set out to make a low-cost and low-tech diagnostic tool for physicians in remote rural locations. It would enable rapid diagnosis. However, what the company has is that and more. There was an added benefit, their nanobodies could be used to test pesticides and other chemicals used to process fresh fruit, easily and inexpensively. Too many or too few chemicals mean the fruit cannot be sold on the international market, which means food waste and environmental waste from land and water use. And the farmer loses income. If all the fruit can make it to market, it means less land needs to be developed for farming, less water is used, less food waste, and greater income security. The environment as a driver for change has led to some of the most flexible and easily implementable frugal innovations. These dynamic start-ups have changed the way we view innovation and their economies made frugality necessary. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in the Western Balkans. For projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from key actors and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, at €200,000 or 50% of direct costs. And there are further provisions for feasibility studies. Implementing partner Impact Hub Vienna is organizing a final online information session on November 19, 2020, for organizations and individuals who would like to learn more about the project. Each of the three events focuses on one theme that was selected after a series of interviews with stakeholders from the Western Balkans and Austria. Join the final information session to learn about frugal innovation and its potential for the region, find out more about the project and funding opportunities, ask questions to representatives of ADA and FFG, get feedback on your project ideas, and network with potential partners in Austria and the Western Balkans.

You have been up for twenty hours. And really, you haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since you launched your business. The endless worry, the never finished to do list, and the emails, which never seem to stop, all have you burning the candle at both ends and then adding string along the sides so the whole thing is a tower of flame. Everything to get your business off the ground, make your dreams come true. You are passionate about your cause. There are people you want to help but now it is all becoming too much. And you can’t bring yourself to care about the newsletter you need to send and it takes you forever to get to your desk to update your website. You start to think no one will read it and you aren’t having an effect so there is no point. Does this sound familiar? This is burnout. And you might have it. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines burnout as a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. They list three characteristics: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one’s job or feelings of cynicism related to one’s job, and reduced professional efficacy. Burn Out Amongst Entrepreneurs According to Jennifer Moss in her article “When Passion Leads to Burnout” for The Harvard Business Review, purpose driven work, the work which drove you to become an entrepreneur in the first place, is one of the sectors at high risk for occupational burnout. As she says at the beginning of the article, “do what you love and you will never work a day in your life” is the messaging we are exposed to constantly. There is even merchandise which says if we are passionate about helping communities, people, or the environment then it will never feel like working. You will do it all the time and feel good about it. But that is simply not the case. A 2019 study at the Vienna University of Economics and Business looked at burnout in Social Impact Award alumni. They found that more than 40% of social entrepreneurs in the program experienced some level of burnout with 5% having experienced severe burnout. Those are some big numbers in a small population. Some of our highest profile entrepreneurs have been speaking out against burnout for years. Mike Lanner, the founder of Vollpension and Gebrüder Stitch, said in an interview with Die Presse, “if you define your self-worth through performance and work, you will never stop working” and that he believed a lack of self-worth and wrongly learned belief systems about working drove him to burn out. “It’s not external pressure but mostly the pressure you create inside your own head.” Ali Mahlodji, founder of watchado, stated that the younger generations adopted old belief systems which perpetuate a culture not suited for today’s circumstances in an interview with Weiner Zeitung. “They feel overwhelmed in a culture that doesn’t meet their needs which often leads to burnout.” I can hear you start to object, saying you made your own culture because you own your own business. However, these two social entrepreneurs are referring to a pervasive idea of workplace culture. According to Moss, “burnout can show up when leaders equate long hours with getting ahead”, when you expect yourself to show up every day regardless of physical or mental illness, or when you have pushed your relationships to the side and are lonely. These are just as a big a risk for social entrepreneurs as it is for large, multinational organizations. Building Up to Avoid Burnout Social impact entrepreneurs want to make a difference. They want to help. However, new research suggests the only way they can do this is by drawing healthy boundaries. Dr. Edward Ellison ‘stresses that they can mitigate this “always-on” mindset by being aware of when passion becomes a double-edged sword. “If you are so inspired to do what you do, then you’re not necessarily good at setting boundaries. We need to teach people that setting boundaries is OK. It’s not selfish. It’s actually selfless. It allows you to be more effective at what you do, and to better [help] those you wish to serve.”’ Impact Hub Global has teamed up with other partners to create The Well-Being Project. The tagline on the website is “well-being inspires well-doing”. “We are catalysing a culture of well-being for all changemakers”. There are articles and webinars on well-being with a specific focus on entrepreneurial wellness. A healthy entrepreneur means a healthy business. Being in good mental health makes us more resilient, able to tackle new challenges, and lets us think through problems and find more solutions. The 2020 edition of RE:WIEN accelerator program (which is in fact its 5th cycle) incorporated a pilot wellbeing program in collaboration with the Hil-Foundation in the accelerator’s curriculum. The wellbeing-centred modules aim to drive a cultural change in the way entrepreneurs perceive, approach, and manage their wellbeing. Led by the theme of “Healthy entrepreneur equals healthy venture”, the Wellbeing Program teaches entrepreneurs the holistic approach of building personal strengths and resilience through a series of hands-on workshops. While the pilot is currently implemented only in RE:WIEN, the long-term intention is to include such training across all startup programs. What Can Individual Entrepreneurs Do? Shockingly, foster friendships. Go to board game nights, play video games over the internet, have a stitch and bitch, host a cookie exchange. Do anything to keep yourself connected to your friends. This is your support network outside your office and you need it. Nurture it and it will nurture you. Talk about it. The Schwab Foundation found that almost 50% of social entrepreneurs experienced burnout. That means one of the people sitting on either side of you at Impact Hub Vienna is either going through it now or has been through it. Talking about it removes the isolation and the stigma. It might also help you make a new friend (see the paragraph above). Make an actual work day. Set hours. Only respond to business enquiries during that time. This is part of boundary setting, which Dr. Ellison says is necessary. Everything outside of those working hours is meant to be for you. Time to eat, time to spend with friends and family, time to sleep, time for sport. This will keep you refreshed and ready to tackle any issues. Exercise. Take a walk in a park. Go for a run. Go hiking. Studies suggest that exercising, especially outdoors, can have a significant impact on mental wellness. Some researchers have found that outdoor exercising can help you feel more revitalized. Many psychologists suggest walking therapy as an effective treatment of burnout. Remember, a healthier you means a healthier business and a healthier community.","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Entrepreneur-Burnout-When-Too-Much-is-More-than-Enough-600x400.jpg","November 25, 2020","en",0.997420966625214,0.00765547908667941,0.388609379529953,0.0079435906445724,0.595791473984718
"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/11/30/the-social-impacts-of-frugal-innovation/","ImpactHub","The Social Impacts of Frugal Innovation","The world is full of really great combinations jam and bread, Batman and Robin, and social impact and frugal innovation. These combinations are natural and the separate pieces feel odd without their partners. And while that last one is new to the list; we are certain you won’t ever think about them separately again after reading this article. The definition used at Impact Hub Vienna explicitly links social impact and frugal innovations: “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” Therefore frugal innovations are, by definition, linked to positive social impact. The affordability aspect is what makes frugal innovation particularly relevant in the current climate. There is a high demand for low-cost quality products at the moment as people are confronting increasing financial difficulties due to nationwide economic stress and global events far out of their control. Large companies are reacting to increased demand in emerging markets, providing targeted and market driven solutions while keeping quality and the needs of the consumer foremost in their planning and development. Mercedes, Siemens, and Google have all jumped on the frugal innovation trend and their range of products and services in these markets reflect the quality the brands are known for while keeping their products affordable. But does this emerging consumer-focused methodology have the capacity for social impact? The answer is: yes. The Best of Partners: Social Impact and Frugal Innovation Social Impact is a nebulous term, encompassing everything from more inclusive policy changes to environmental sustainability. However, the accepted definition is the positive effect action (or inaction) it has on communities. These communities can be global or hyper-local. What matters is a pressing social need within the communities is addressed through inclusive means. When Mercedes Benz was looking to create a cost-effective truck for the Indian market, they spent time with truck drivers all over the country to understand their needs and design a product which matched. When Martin Wesian was personally affected by cholera while travelling, the need to create a cheap, efficient, and accessible solution for clean drinking water became clear in his mind, and so he developed WADI, which is now in use in Uganda and Kenya. Graggar Bakeries in Vienna helps disadvantaged communities by designing and building specific ovens to bake bread and consulting in the development of business plans to make the effort sustainable in the long term. So, what do trucks, clean water, and bread have in common? While these are all frugal innovations, they are inexpensive trucks, disinfection systems, and ovens. They are also so much more. They have massive impacts. In order to build the trucks for the Indian market, Mercedes Benz built local factories. Which have now expanded to manufacturing buses as well. Creating well paid and safe jobs. While these are still fossil fuel powered, they use less fuel and produce less emissions than their counterparts in the region. WADI and Helioz have worked hard to ensure clean drinking water is available in Uganda and Kenya, reducing the effects of water borne pathogens, like cholera, hemorrhagic e-coli, and dysentery. Creating healthier communities. Graggar Bakeries enables income generation and self-sufficiency in some of the most economically depressed areas of developing economies. They work with communities to design ovens specifically tailored to the area’s needs and resources, including fuel sources. They work with communities to develop business plans to support long-term sustainability of the local bakery and a community reinvestment plan for the profits. That is already a lot. Locally, Graggar Bakeries works with some of the most disenfranchised members of society, persons with cognitive disabilities. They provide apprenticeships as bakers or confectioners, enabling and empowering people. They work with Caritas in a number of countries, especially in the Balkans to provide support and programs. These are companies, through their products and services, with massive social impacts. From job creation to economic empowerment and healthy communities to reinvesting in development. These are the impacts every social entrepreneur strives to achieve. Solving a local issue using innovative processes and enabling people to build stronger communities and economic partnerships. Their use of the frugal innovation concepts enabled them to create products and services which the communities needed. Their targeted consumer driven processes mean their solutions were the most usable and meaningful. As mentioned before, it will be hard to separate frugal innovation from social impact. They are made for each other. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by ADA and FFG to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The political situation throughout the Western Balkans is stabilizing and the economies are growing. Austria is uniquely positioned, with traditional trade ties and a significant start-up eco-system, to partner with Western Balkans entrepreneurs, start-ups, and subject matter experts to create new and innovative solutions for existing challenges. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in the Western Balkans. The details for the funding packages and eligibility requirements are on our partner websites. But we have a quick summary here: for projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from stakeholders in the Western Balkans and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, at €200,000 or 50% of direct costs. And there are further provisions for feasibility studies. We know products and services developed using frugal innovation have the potential to make huge impacts on the economy and the quality of life of people who use them.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/12/10/innovation-vanguard-technology-and-frugal-innovation/","ImpactHub","Innovation Vanguard: Technology and Frugal Innovation","The tech sector is always innovating. Always giving us something newer, better, faster than the previous version. The sector spans everything from cell phones to industrial power convertors. We have better medical imaging equipment, smarter cars, and adaptive prosthetics. And the technology industry has been one of the first to adopt frugal innovation practices. Tech products are some of the most expensive items in our homes and pockets. Think about the technology you have around you, computers, televisions, cell phones, games consoles, tablets, cable boxes, and the list can go on and on. However, savvy consumers have started looking for less expensive alternatives to high price tag tech. And some companies are delivering, from industry giants to start-ups. Frugal Innovation in the Consumer Marketplace Earlier this year, Google announced a pared-down cell phone offering. The Verge stated, they “stripped the phone to just essentials, but gets them right”. The consumer gets a good camera and a decent battery life but loses out on wireless charging. For the €340 compared to other phones currently on the market, it doesn’t seem like giving up a feature we are not quite used to yet will have much impact on our daily lives. Google also did things like reduce colour options to only black and reduce the size options to make the mobile phone more cost efficient. Thanks to frugal innovation, which enabled better understanding of the features users want, Google was able to offer an affordable product which enabled more people in the cash strapped post-covid economy to access the technology which has quickly become vital to our daily lives. Medical Technology and Frugal Innovation Medical Technology changes as quickly as research allows. This market segment is constantly pivoting to meet the evolving needs of consumers around the world, from state-of-the-art medical imaging and interventions in cancer care to the basics of medical imaging for maternal fetal medicine in rural areas of developing economies. Each is equally important for this industry. GE Healthcare has worked to provide diagnostic imaging solutions across the spectrum of clinical needs, everything from complex cancer care imaging to basic sonographs. GE’s handheld ultrasound scanner “was specifically designed to enable earlier identification of at-risk pregnancies so that they can be addressed to reduce the mortality rates”. GE developed a product which “addresses key challenges in maternal care faced by emerging economies around the world” because of its thorough consultation with stakeholders and users. A competitive advantage, according to the Global Information Exchange. Their goal was to address the lack of medical care during pregnancy in developing economies. Women do not have the option of early care or, sometimes, any care “due to lack of access, shortage of physicians in high mortality, low resource areas, lack of tools to detect complications and make referrals, as well as high cost and fragility of typical medical devices.” According to Global Information Exchange, “Vscan Access overcomes these challenges via its simple and durable design, which provides excellent clinical utility at an affordable price.” Vienna is no stranger to medical innovation, in fact it has a long history of it, from the first steps to improve maternal survival rates in the 1800s through hand washing to some of the first surgical quality improvement programs. A local company is changing the way we think about diabetic care. MySugr, wants to “make diabetes suck less”. They aim to “improve the lives of people with diabetes by providing our users with a quick and easy solution to collect all relevant therapy data in one place.” They offer personalized coaching packages and interfacing and data collection from glucose monitors which empowers patients to make healthier choices over time. Rather than rely on expensive in person clinics with high overheads to offer their services, they went with the much less expensive service of offering care through video chat technologies. They took advantage of new less expensive technologies to create a better, more accessible patient-centered model of care. The side benefit to this is improving the care of diabetes in rural areas across the world, where care is not always accessible. This unique service and web-based technology is providing better access to coaching and education. Diabetes is on the rise, the world over, and developing economies are seeing steep increases. MySugr, and other services like this, make it easy to access high quality and evidence-based medical care. The app and the coaches behind it provide support to patients struggling with drastic lifestyle changes and education to make better choices; improving clinical outcomes for patients across the world. Frugal innovation in technology is helping health care providers the world over better care for patients and populations. Commercial Technology and Frugal Innovation The commercial technology sector is constantly evolving to meet the needs of consumers all over the world, whether someone is in Vienna or rural India. Siemens is perhaps the best example of providing technology to a specific market. They have used their own “SMART” approach, Simple, Maintenance-friendly, Affordable, Reliable, and timely to market. Felix Scheffler says, in an interview with The Guardian, “[i]n the past, perceived quality was more or less attached to the technological sophistication of a product, the highest number of features, [now] less is more. And this definitely calls for a huge change in mindset.” A great example is the power converters imported from Germany to China. They were deemed too costly and broke down frequently. This led to a perception amongst Chinese consumers that Siemens products were of a lower quality. An investigation conducted by Siemens found that the high level of dust pollution in the area was adversely affecting the products. They went back to the literal drawing board and created a simpler converter which malfunctioned less; because it had fewer features it also cost less. The decreased cost and increased reliability made the consumers happier, enabling a greater market share in China. Frugal Innovation, Impact Hub and The Innovation for a Better World Project These are stories of mega tech giants. They and their products are known all over the world. Many of us even have them in our homes. These companies have massive impacts on our daily lives. However, local companies are now able to access new funding opportunities. The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency to help organizations from Austria, the Western Balkans and beyond to make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in emerging markets in the Western Balkans and Africa. The details for the funding packages and eligibility requirements are on our partner websites. But we have a quick summary here: for projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from emerging economy stakeholders and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects through the impact innovation funding scheme. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, ranging from €20,000 for feasibility studies to €500,000 for multi-stakeholder strategic alliances.

What’s a single person’s impact?“ Sure, we recycle our waste to the best of our abilities, and we board night-trains instead of planes when possible. Reducing CO2 emissions feels good! Yet, there is this constant lingering question accompanying us: „Is it enough?“ The answer certainly is unfortunate. While every individual’s effort is an important step in the right direction, this society and planet have reached a precipice. We know that change has to happen. We know that it has to happen now. But change has to happen on a larger scale, on a Corporate-, Asset- and Entrepreneurial level. Role-Models encourage us to see things from different angles, to leave the beaten path and maybe find an even better one. They are trailblazing and showing us that change can happen, even more that it is already happening. What started as a trend is now a movement. Entrepreneurs putting their visions of a better future in the centre of their endeavors. Corporates empowering their employees to initiate change towards sustainability in their daily work. And last but not least Asset Owners, increasing their investments in the areas of social- and climate impact. To support and bring recognition to those best practices, Mercer and Institutional Money have initiated the Money 4 Change – Impact Awards, which will be presented in four categories: Asset Owners This category recognizes asset owners who already have an increased focus/adjustment to SDGs and/or are making increased investments in the area of Social/Climate Impact and/or take climate risks into account in the decision-making process. An ESG process has long been established. Corporates This category honors corporates that use sustainable people management to help ensure that the people in the organization are treated responsibly and can therefore act responsibly themselves. The focus is on corporates that consciously encourage and empower employees to initiate changes in their daily work towards sustainability. Entrepreneurs This category honors entrepreneurs who have put their focus on Social or Climate Impact. With their innovative impact solutions they support the SDGs. Collaboration (Corporations which have a measurable, sustainable and positive impact on the SDGs) This category honors asset owners, companies and entrepreneurs who have jointly (with at least 2 of the categories listed) achieved a successful implementation of one of the DSG goals or jointly implemented innovative solutions. To be eligible for application, Asset Owners, Corporates and Entrepreneurs must have: Created an alignment with the SDGs (the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations) – having max. 3 SDGs in focus Implemented innovative ideas to solve climate/social problems and challenges Developed and shaped an impact strategy or process A (measurable) sustainable and positive impact on the SDGs Collaborated with each other and achieved one of the above mentioned (optional) The minimum requirement for Asset Owners & Corporates is a Membership of UNPRI and/or UNGC (or planned membership until May 30, 2021 or nomination of an existing member of UNPRI/UNGC to submit the award). For Entrepreneurs the business solution must focus on Social or Climate Impact. The call for application will be open until April 16, 2021 here. The jury process will take place in two stages: a pre-selection of the nominees and the subsequent final selection of the award winners. The Evaluation is based on the 5 Dimensions of Impact (IMP): Level of Impact: What change/impact has been created? What problem has the Asset Owner/Corporate/Entrepreneur identified and what was the solution? Stakeholders/Beneficiaries: Who has benefited from the change? Who is the target group? Level of Outcome/How much: Has the outcome target been defined and measured? What’s an evaluation possible and how? How deep/marginal was the change if measurement was possible? Level of Contribution: Was the contribution marginal or significant/innovative? Is the company a pioneer when it comes to the measures taken? Any other factors which have been supportive? How important is impact when it comes to the decision making process? Level of Risk: Has the defined target been reached? We’re there any challenges during the implementation/delivery process? The jury focus will lay on the implementation of the respective strategy/process/solution and the resulting impact. In April 2021, a short list of twelve finalists – three per category – will be disclosed. The three final winners will be announced at the gala evening during the „Institutional Money Congress“ in Wiesbaden on May 26, 2021. In addition, the winners will present their solution this year at the „Impact Days“ in Vienna. Meet the Jury: Institutional Money The leading trade magazine for institutional investors from German-speaking Europe also organizes the annual Institutional Money Congress with 1500 participants, and provides profound analyses and breaking news for their readers.

A striking number, but in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C (as agreed on by 195 countries in the Paris Agreement), a decrease in emissions at that scale is required every year of the upcoming decade. History tells us that emissions tend to bounce back quickly (like after the Financial Crisis 2008-2009). Failing to reach the 1.5°C goal will not only lead to harsh consequences for societies and eco-systems, but furthermore pose significant risks for investors. The Cambridge Institute for Sustainable Leadership found that substantial climate related losses in portfolio value could already show in timescales that are relevant to all investors, not only long-term investors. There is a growing consensus among leading investors that we are moving towards a low carbon economy, and it seems unlikely that the motor of economic growth will continue to be predominantly powered by fossil fuels. In fact, according to recent reports, the industry has reached a turning point, where ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) and non-ESG products begin to converge, and fund providers find it increasingly more difficult to sell non-ESG funds. European ESG assets could reach up between 41% and 57% of total European mutual fund assets by 2025 (up from just 15.1% as of the end of 2019). A fundamental change is on it’s way. Over a period from 2010 to 2019 ESG aligned funds already cumulatively outperformed traditional funds by 9%, with different analysis showing that close to 60% of sustainable funds delivered higher returns than non sustainable funds. With the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been increased concern that ESG issues would be set aside, but the resilience of ESG funds has been demonstrated even further, proving that investing in sustainable funds doesn’t come at cost, but can future-proof investments and boost returns. 88 percent of sustainable funds outperformed their non sustainable counterparts in the period of January 1 to April 30, 2020, shows a report of Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager. There is a fast increasing interest in sustainable investment, with a clear impact on the industry. With companies being put “on watch” by investors for failing to take climate risks fully into account, management’s risk being voted against at future shareholder meetings if climate risks are not addressed. Investor demand is surging, and leaving the industry with little to no choice but to become part of the change. Capital is allocated in a sustainable manner and more and more investors are turning to ESG. In 2019 flows into European ESG products represented 19,8% of their total AUM (in comparison to non-ESG funds accounting for 3,8% of AUM) While a majority of the European institutional investors are acting ESG-oriented, it is especially the nordic countries that constantly put Europe at the forefront of ESG investment. Norway is about to emerge as one of the world’s largest investors in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure within the next few years. At the same time, oil, gas and coal corporations are facing an accelerating divestment process, with Danish and Swedish pension funds following the Norwegian strategy. It is crucial that asset owners address climate related financial risk, while safeguarding the assets and pensions of future generations. 77% of institutional investors are planning to completely halt purchasing non-ESG products by 2022, contrasting only 14% of fund providers that plan to stop offering non-ESG products by the same year. While the retail investor segment is still lagging behind institutional, it is quickly gaining traction. With the Millenials entering the space and an increased public awareness of risks that are ESG related, investing for meaningful impact will be the core portfolio for many investors. Being at the receiving end of 41 trillion USD in intergenerational wealth transfer, Millennials rank impact performance as their primary investment criteria, ahead of return (according to a survey by the World Economic Forum). Individuals as well as institutions are looking to their financial planners to advise on, and to the financial services industry to supply financial products and strategies that align with their broader goals. Over the last few years a whole new set of client demands emerged, and many firms have been able to provide solutions and lead the green revolution.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/02/09/entrepreneurs-working-on-a-better-future-for-everybody/","ImpactHub","From the get-go: Entrepreneurs working on a better future for everybody","In recent years climate change and the importance of immediate measures to tackle the most fundamental issues of our time have reached a new level of awareness among people around the globe. More and more have become concerned about the sustainability of our beautiful planet, big movements arose and are urging governments and corporations for change. The time has come to work together and build a better future for everyone. An increasing number of corporations is integrating the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations into their business conduct. But it is especially the Entrepreneurs and their start-up ventures who often act as the channel through which new and disruptive technologies and approaches reach the market. With their break-through solutions they have an immense impact on our societies and the environment. They find solutions to problems once deemed unsolvable, and show that corporate success and working on a better future for everyone are not mutually exclusive. Sustainability is playing an increasingly important role, and the number of start-ups who assign their business purpose to the Green Economy or Social Entrepreneurship has been growing for several consecutive years. Survey shows that 21 % of German startups’ products and services make a concrete contribution to environmental and climate protection, and therefore classify as green. While those green startups have a significantly higher rate of female founders than non green startups, and they foster the participation and advancement of their employees at a much greater rate, they face much greater challenges in raising capital. In contrast, expectations for the business climate among green startups are better than their nongreen counterparts, and even much better than in the established industry. Green start-ups are surely no less growth- and profit-oriented, but in addition they create social and ecological impact. Paradeisa and markta are great examples of bringing local producers and customers together, and therefore avoiding waste, saving transport, storage and packaging, while also enabling fair prices for both sides. Did you know that chewing gum is made from polymers which are synthetic plastics and they don’t biodegrade? And yes, you guessed it: up to 90% of it is not disposed properly. Alpengummi has developed a new chewing gum concept that is also based on old traditions: A natural chewing gum, whose gum base is extracted from tree resin and beeswax. With fast fashion adding massive amounts to the environment, endlosfesch came up with the great idea to create Viennas’ first fashion library, renting out unique and high-quality clothing from young local designers. A small membership fee opens the doors to an endless wardrobe full of sustainably sourced fashionable items. The online platform WISR is matching companies with experienced retirees for project-based work, to preserve their knowledge and to help senior talents find exciting challenges and purposes. And then there is wohnbuddy, a great platform that enables flat-sharing between different generations. Magdas Hotel opened its doors in 2015, and is Europe’s first hotel run by refugees. Habibi & Hawara is an entirely private and independent incubator for future entrepreneurs, also a social training and integration project for refugees and migrants to equip them with an entrepreneurial tool Vollpension, an intergenerational coffeehouse, quickly became a fixture in Vienna’s vast coffeehouse scene. Pensioners prepare meals and desserts served by young people in a 60’s-70’s atmosphere. It is a place where generations meet, share stories and life experiences. Shades tours is creating jobs for homeless people to work as alternative tour guides, giving them an income and an opportunity to combat their homelessness. Their educational tours for the local community explain the multiple shades of homelessness, and present the different institutions that form Vienna’s social net. There is great optimism among green start-ups: 3 in 4 start-ups are expecting an improvement in their business situation, contrasting the more pessimistic expectations of non green start-ups and the general economy. From Renewable energy to environmental protection, from circular economy to reduced inequalities, with their innovative ideas and approaches, green start-ups are successfully tackling the whole range of the Sustainable Development Goals. They have a great sense for peoples wishes and needs in regards to more sustainable solutions in their respective niche. They show that entrepreneurial success can be achieved while actively changing the world for the better, and they prove every day that they deserve support, from governments, from decision makers, from asset owners and investors and from everybody that wishes for a better future for everyone.

As a symbol of Impact Hub’s commitment for a climate neutral future, we sow the first seed of The Impact Hub Forest. The one hundred trees we have chosen to plant can absorb, in the first year, enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to fill up 77,538 basketballs! You can also plant a tree in the Impact Hub Forest! Wouldn’t it be fantastic to grow ten times by the end of the year?

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/02/23/corporates-boosting-efforts-to-do-better/","ImpactHub","The times they are a changin’ – Corporates boosting efforts to do better","In 1987 the United Nations published their report “Our Common Future” describing sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 34 years went by, half a lifetime in 52 of the 193 countries recognized by the UN, and very close to that in many more. One starts to question how many businesses really tied their desire for growth closely to the aim of not damaging future generations prospects. Too little, too slow. The beginning of the negotiations for the Paris Climate Agreement sparked a new era of increased public awareness and activism. Through all age groups and walks of life, people are well informed and up to date on the pressing challenges that lie ahead. And people are increasingly willing to directly address the sources of these issues and to hold them accountable. “What have you done?”, young people demand answers from governments, corporations and the generations of their parents and grandparents as a whole. “What have you done to contribute to these problems?” but also “What have you done to prevent them?”. While the answers to those questions don’t come easy, the answers to “What next?” lie before us in plain sight. The UN set up 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), a blueprint to achieve a better and sustainable future for all. And while progress is already being made in many places, it needs advanced speed and scale in order to deliver the Goals by 2030. So with “Ten years to transform our world” they are proclaiming a Decade of Action, calling on all sectors of society to mobilize on three levels: global action, local action and people action. As of today, more than 12.000 companies in over 160 countries joined the UN Global Compact, which is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. Enterprises and Corporations are increasingly implementing the SDGs into their business conduct, aiming either for minimal negative impact or even positive effects on global (or local) environment, community, society or economy. A strategy that seems to come with significant economic rewards. A study by the public research organisation “The Conference Board” shows that out of 12 companies (incl.Siemens, Toshiba, DuPont and Philips) between 2010 and 2013 revenues from sustainable products grew at six times the rate of overall company revenues. Corporate giant Unilever has also seen brands that have integrated sustainability into both their purpose and products grow 30% faster than the rest of their business. The list of actions that can be taken to work towards achieving a better future for everyone spans across all fields of our daily lives: To end poverty, corporations can improve access to basic goods and services for people living in poverty, develop products and services tailored for poor customers, or invest in business-driven poverty eradication activities. But beyond low income, poverty often comes with limited opportunities and capabilities that can be addressed by recruiting, training and employing local community members. By the empowerment of small farmers and by the increase of agricultural investment, as well as knowledge sharing and rising consumers’ awareness, businesses can help to end hunger, to achieve food security and to promote sustainable agriculture. To ensure the availability and sustainable management of clean water and sanitation for everybody, businesses can prioritize water efficiency across operations by installing best practice technologies for water conservation. They can educate employees and consumers about appropriate water behaviors and the importance of water efficiency, invest in water treatment in order to prevent municipal treatment facilities to be overburdened by industrial waste-water etc. Corporations are taking urgent action to combat climate change, by sourcing all electricity from renewable sources, by reducing the carbon footprint due to greater fuel efficiency and local sourcing. They increase investments in innovation to improve the efficiency of their portfolios, and with the understanding of climate risk they build resilience into their assets and supply chains. Businesses strive to achieve gender equality and to empower all women and girls, with goals being sufficient participation of women (30% or greater) in decision-making and governance at all levels, equal pay and access to child and dependent care services. Zero-tolerance policies towards all forms of violence at work are implemented and an expansion in business relationships with women-owned enterprises is fostered. We are living in transformative times, and we know the direction. Step by step we are on our way, and more and more businesses and corporations are starting to acknowledge their responsibility, and to see that change has a big potential to lead to increased (financial) success. Mercer and Institutional Money want to support and bring recognition to best practices, and therefore initiated The “Money 4 Change – Impact Awards.” Presented in four categories, the awards will highlight Asset Owners, Corporates, Entrepreneurs and Collaboration. Today, we invite Corporations who already have an increased focus/adjustment to SDGs and/or are making increased investments in the area of Social/Climate Impact and/or take climate risks into account in the decision-making process to apply until April 16, 2021 here. To be eligible for application Corporations must have: Created an alignment with the SDGs (the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations) – having max. 3 SDGs in focus Implemented innovative ideas to solve climate/social problems and challenges Developed and shaped an impact strategy or process A (measurable) sustainable and positive impact on the SDGs In April 2021, a short list of twelve finalists – three per category – will be disclosed. The final winners will be announced at the gala evening during the „Institutional Money Congress“ in Wiesbaden on May 26, 2021.In addition, the winners are going to present their solutions at the „Impact Days“, an annual community gathering of professionals interested in mainstreaming impact. Held this year at the Hofburg palace in Vienna, 400 professionals working in innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment for impact across Europe are looking at what already works, and what still needs to be done for the transition towards the impact economy.

With the current outroll of vaccines gaining traction, there is finally a sense of relief in the air, going hand in hand with an eagerness to finally push through and start to rebuild what has been shattered. Building back is one thing, but this time we should not miss the great chance to build back better. More than ever it has been made apparent that global partnerships and a strengthened multilateralism are core principles if we are to solve the world’s problems together. Governments, scientists, academia, civil society and the private sector, everyone needs to come together! Collaboration is key! Especially working with unconventional partners can result in breakthroughs that would not have been possible otherwise. We tend to have preconceptions on how something should be done, but it is diversity of thought that often leads to success. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set bei the United Nations is definitely not going to be an easy feat. Yet, what better objective than preserving the precious but fragile global ecosystem we call home? What better aim than achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone? Ambitious are the goals, and just as ambitious have to be the collaborative efforts, on global and local levels, in order to tackle the complex systemic transformations necessary to reach our targets. Great examples of successful cooperation can be found in the Circular Economy Switzerland (CES), a vast network of private companies and public organisations, fostering creative solutions and innovative initiatives and striving to transition the linear economy model to a circular economy in Switzerland. One of those initiatives is #movethedate Switzerland. Supported by the Promotion Fund “Engagement Migros” of Switzerland’s largest retail company, they started a movement committed to postponing “overshoot day” (the day we exhaust all natural resources available to us for one year) by promoting projects and companies that already prove that it can be done differently. Another great initiative is Make Furniture Circular. Over the years fast furniture has become the new normal, sharing the growing waste problem with fast fashion, while it’s components are even harder to dispose of. Make Furniture Circular is giving fresh impetus to the swiss furniture retail market, creating new futureproof products by design thinking, innovative business models and in direct dialog with suppliers. With an Innovation Hub in Amsterdam, the global initiative “Fashion for Good” is on the mission to make all fashion good. By sparking and scaling innovation, by offering practical action in the form of support, funding and roadmaps, and by fostering sector-wide collaboration rather than competition, they enable the daring invention and widespread adoption of good fashion practice. They work directly alongside the most promising Innovators, bringing them together with market players, i.e. brands, retailers and manufacturers, in order to make it easier for them to work together effectively, bridge the innovation gap and bring these innovations to the mainstream. These corporates benefit from our innovation scouting and screening capabilities, comprehensive technology landscaping and our hands-on support in piloting and scaling innovations. In 2018 they opened the doors to the Fashion for Good museum in Amsterdam, which tells the stories behind the clothes we wear and how our choices for those clothes can have a positive impact on the fashion industry. Cooperation has the potential to achieve impressive results. Companies’ increased participation in collaborative efforts is advancing awareness of social, environmental, and governance risks, but also awareness of business opportunities. Across societal sectors collaboration emerged as one of the defining concepts of international development in the 21st century. Partnership has grown from a response to the limitations of traditional development approaches into an essential paradigm in sustainable development. The financial, natural and human resources of our planet are limited, and it is time for us to optimize their use. At the fundamental core of successful cooperation is the ability to bring varied resources together and so enable better achievements. Increased value for all, greater sustainability, more impact! To support and bring recognition to best practices, Mercer and Institutional Money have initiated The Money 4 Change – Impact Awards. Presented in four categories, the awards will highlight Asset Owners, Corporates, Entrepreneurs and Cooperation. Today, we invite Asset Owners, Corporates and Entrepreneurs who have jointly (with at least 2 of the categories listed) achieved a successful implementation of one of the SDG goals or jointly implemented innovative solutions to apply until April 16, 2021 here.

"https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/03/05/education-and-social-impact-in-the-time-of-covid-19/","ImpactHub","Education and social impact in the time of COVID-19","We have been battling through this pandemic long enough to know precisely what the arguments behind the restrictions are and what effects we could end up facing if we do not stick to the current distancing measures: a healthcare system strained to the point of collapse and a string of ever-returning lockdowns bringing the national economy to its knees. At the same time, we know that the bigger picture is much bigger than this and that the pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on many more areas of life, one of the most important being education. It is of course too early to draw conclusions as to what exactly that impact will amount to, but the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has already warned that the COVID-19-induced learning loss may lead to the “Corona-generation” earning up to 3% less in the future, as the months spent at home are correlated with reduced productivity, which, in turn, affects skills negatively. And money is not the only issue. According to a survey carried out by a team of psychologists from the University of Vienna, most pupils reported feeling better or slightly better upon returning to in-person teaching, the decisive factor in this evaluation being the possibility to interact with their classmates and teachers. Given that the next lockdown could come into effect any time, this interaction is once again limited, so we can expect new dips in the pupils’ state of mind. The good thing is that we now know the drill, because we’ve already been there once. Challenges have been confronted head on. Lessons have been learned. But what kind of lessons? In order to find an answer to this question, I had the pleasure to interview David Schalkhammer, co-founder of SchoolFox, Lydia Wazir-Staubmann, trainer at Teach for Austria, and Rosa Bergmann, co-founder of Vienna Hobby Lobby. They have helped me gain an understanding of what social impact in the field of education looks like when social distancing becomes the norm. Cue the drum roll… Lesson no. 1 Quality over quantity is not just a saying. Least of all in education SchoolFox is an online platform that facilitates regular and distance learning. The app was launched in 2015 by David Schalkhammer, Stefan Siegl and Julian Breitenecker. Back then, they had no idea that we would be living a time when education would – albeit temporarily – move to the online environment, so the first two pillars which the features of the app were based on were Communication and Organization. “The system was very old-fashioned. We, as parents, were struggling to keep in touch with the schools and felt that some processes were not particularly transparent. At the same time, the teachers felt that they were wasting a lot of time every week trying to reach the families and plan events. Our initial solution was to basically bring features that we were already using at work to the school environment,” David Schalkhammer explained. This included the possibility to chat, keep track of absences, plan parents’ evenings, translate messages into multiple languages and the like. Five years later, the coronavirus pandemic broke out. “At the beginning of the first lockdown, we were shocked that homeschooling was happening, as this had been unimaginable before. At least in Austria. Luckily, we had already planned file-sharing in December, so we were quick to provide the feature. We also managed to incorporate a conferencing tool.” This adaptability served them well, as the number of users opting for SchoolFox doubled, and 50% of all Austrian schools ended up using the platform. Even so, when asked if there were needs that the team could not meet during the pandemic, David said: “Of course. This time we were fast with file-sharing, but it was a coincidence. If you are fast, the quality is usually not the best, so it is important to prioritize certain things. We now have a big community of teachers and parents, some of whom send very detailed emails explaining exactly what they need from us. We take their ideas into account, but in general, we plan at least one or two months ahead and try to make sure that the features we provide are relevant to the market as a whole.” In other words: Flexibility, yes. Hasty improvisations to the detriment of the users’ experience, no. Lesson no. 2 Digitalization is not a one-fits-all solution… Seeing that SchoolFox was pretty much ahead of its time and the team behind it worked towards more efficient digital processes long before the majority of us even considered having all sorts of apps involved in the education system, I wondered whether David – the co-founder of a digital tool – believes that distance learning can indeed replace in-person teaching. His realistic attitude struck me once again: “Going exclusively digital is not a good idea. We are social animals. We want to see and talk to other people. But it is a reality that learning and working don’t stop just because you leave the classroom or the office, so a tool like SchoolFox gives you the possibility to stay in touch remotely and be more flexible. That’s what we are aiming at, connecting people. We see education as team work, so we are teacher-oriented, parent-oriented and student-oriented.” Lesson no. 3 … yet digital learning should be an integral part of teacher training In order for the connection that David mentioned to work, the teachers also need to know exactly what strategies are best suited for remote engagement. This kind of knowledge can be acquired through targeted workshops, something that Lydia Wazir-Staubmann and I talked about. Lydia works as a trainer at Teach for Austria, an organization whose objective is to ensure that all children receive equal access to education regardless of their parents’ financial resources or educational background. Her task consists of supporting TfA fellows to become better teachers and effect change, either in the community or the system as a whole. When discussing how Teach for Austria dealt with the sudden need to provide digital training, she said: “We quickly put together training sessions on digital tools, which helped the fellows stay in touch with their students and give interactive assignments during the first lockdown. The challenge was to reach everybody, because many children don’t have suitable devices, they don’t have a quiet room at home and so on… It was important to mix up not just digital resources, but also things like handouts that the kids could pick up. We also provided resilience training for teachers and interactive live classroom training in order to show the fellows different methods of holding the students’ attention. It’s one thing for me to sit with you and talk, but that’s not how you keep the students involved during class. You need to use the chat, online whiteboards, polls, interactive documents that all of the children can contribute to live and so on.” However, acquiring such skills requires time, which is why Lydia believes that digital learning should be an integral part of the curriculum. Both at Teach for Austria and in ‘traditional’ teacher trainings: “We need to be more focused on this component. Instead of having one or two workshops devoted to it, we should make sure it is a fixed part of the program, so that both teachers and students learn to switch back and forth.” Lesson no. 4 Not everything went as disastrously as we may have expected… Despite the added responsibility that teachers had to take on, the conflicting messages that they have received during the past few months and the stress the children themselves have experienced, Lydia says that the pandemic had positive effects too: “We are more in the news. The gap is more visible, and the government has even provided schools with free equipment, which was never part of the conversation before. The fellows – and teachers in general – have also gained skills that they didn’t have before. That doesn’t go away. Not to mention that they were able to work in a more differentiated way and have more one-on-one sessions with their students, which led to some of the children blossoming.” Lesson no. 5 … and one way to make sure of that is to never assume what children need. Ask them instead. Education is not limited to academic performance. In fact, as Vienna Hobby Lobby aims to show, education should take place anywhere and everywhere. That is why the organization co-founded by Rosa Bergmann provides free leisure opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds: “Most of the children come from families that cannot afford extracurricular activities. The parents work a lot and spend little time at home, so the kids are stuck in an environment where they don’t get to explore their passions. We try to help them learn by interacting with others. Communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration are some of the most important lessons we share.” The activities meant to convey these skills range from kickboxing and street art to theater, drawing and yoga. They are also something that the most vulnerable children of all had to give up on during the lockdown. So how did Vienna Hobby Lobby adapt? “We put together a Buddy system, trying to stay in touch with the kids and help them with their school work. We also had a drawing challenge and a sport challenge, where they had to send pictures and videos. But we quickly realized that the children didn’t want more online activities, so we just showed them that we were there and took the time to plan for the summer instead. I think a lot of people want to help kids, but sometimes they don’t ask them what they need and bombard them with things that don’t really make a difference. It’s important to communicate openly.” Lesson no. 6 Even so, the idea that your education business is flourishing may not always be a reason for joy Something that all of the ventures I brought together for these interviews had in common was the fact that they have grown or that their mission has received significantly more attention during the pandemic. This, in itself, is not a problem. After all, awareness is key, and the more people gain access to tools or organizations that can help them, the better. However, as Rosa passionately pointed out, this growth also shows that the issues which the education system is confronted with may have been overlooked for far too long and reached a much more profound level than initially suspected. “During the past months, we have had a lot more time to focus on strategy and implement a pilot project in the 20th district too. At the same time, many parents spent time at home and realized how difficult it is to find suitable activities for their children, so we are now facing a demand that far exceeds our capabilities. People are paying attention. But it is difficult to see the kids struggling. Some of them are fine, while others have become shyer and more withdrawn. You can tell that there is fear and insecurity in their behavior, and we cannot help them as we would like to, because we have to keep our distance.” The Future of Education To sum up, the journey is far from the end, but the lessons we have accumulated so far are bound to make the road less bumpy. We can’t unsee what we have seen and unlearn what we have learned. Instead, we are pushing ahead – all the wiser.

It made us rethink our routines, slowed down or even paused activities, maybe forced us to make shifts and in the best case find silver linings. But let’s also take the current situation as a wake-up call for one of society’s biggest challenges ahead: climate change, which won’t be over soon and cannot just be fixed with a vaccine. So here is to the climate entrepreneurs. To mitigate the devastating effects we need entrepreneurs who are driven by a desire to change the world for the better and create solutions for a greener future. We believe that startups’ innovative power is a valuable resource in the development of sustainable concepts. Especially so if connected to leading city departments and corporations committed to addressing the problems at scale, and together. Let’s fix this together!

Now is the time for startups to join this journey towards cities with a carbon-neutral future. The Clean Cities ClimAccelerator is an EU-wide acceleration program that aims to support 30 climate-focused startups with over EUR 400K in grants and a state-of-the-art program. We are looking for startups developing solutions focused on the transformation towards climate neutrality, across all city systems – from mobility to waste, from energy to health, and the built environment. The accelerator offers a 9 month mentoring and coaching program with international experts, and up to EUR 25,000 in grants per startup – applications are open until May 16th on: www.cleancities.network Built on the ecosystems developed within the Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities of the City of Vienna and the City of Madrid is focusing on actual challenges of the respective cities.

It asked us to think about the future of our spaces – and pushed us to have them ready to be experienced online and hybrid. We are excited about where it got us and happy to lift the curtain and believe we can now offer the unique Impact Hub vibe online, offer high-level virtual hosting, and create interaction in a constructive, inclusive, sustainable way. We are done spending our energies in fear, we look for new scenarios enabling our community to action. For this reason, we have re-designed and beautified our meeting rooms and event space to offer the perfect environment for virtual events and workshops: our space has been terrifically improved, the Mini Meeting Room can now also be used as a cool Podcast Room; our Event Room was re-born as The Hybrid Stage, now able to deliver hybrid events at the highest quality, with full technical support and the state-of-the-art equipment, provided in collaboration with Zeitecht and Zimtfilm. So, yes, these times are critical, but they also open up to a whole new world of opportunities. It is time to experience them: have a look at the new space catalog, book our space or join our Impact Expedition Stronger Together: Mit Innovation und Kollaboration zur Klimaneutralität on June 1st to enjoy a genuine Impact Hub hybrid experience!

Azoomee revolutioniert den Geschichtsunterreicht an Wiener Schulen mithilfe von Augmented Reality und Scarletred schafft telemedizinische Wundversorgung für die mobile Pflege in Wien. Marcus Grausam, CEO A1 Österreich: „Als A1 legen wir mit unserem 5Giganetz die Basis für neue Services und Möglichkeiten und unterstützen besonders auch Wiener Betriebe, Start Ups und Privatpersonen dabei, die Vorteile der Digitalisierung für sich zu nutzen. Wir sind stolz, dass die Siegerprojekte von Azoomee und Scarletred in den Kategorien Bildung und Gesundheit aus unserem Haus kommen. Augmented und Virtual Reality werden in Zukunft wichtige Anwendungen für 5G sein – gerade im Bildungsbereich -, und auch die Medizin wird von 5G und den Möglichkeiten sicherlich profitieren.“ Die Siegerprojekte von Azoomee und ScarletredAzoomee ist ein globales Medienunternehmen und App-Entwicklungsstudio, das sich auf Anwendungen zur pädagogischen Unterhaltung für Kinder konzentriert. Mit ihrem Projekt „Virtual Vienna“ revolutioniert Azoomee den Geschichtsunterricht an Wiens Schulen. Durch 5G werden historisch wertvolle Orte in der Stadt zum Leben erweckt und durch interaktive Aufgaben, durchgeführt von von Oomee-Charakteren in Augmented Reality, lernen die Kinder spielerisch Inhalte. Diese Charaktere führen Kinder durch die Lerninhalte während sie die Stadt erkunden. Die Lösung wird auch im Tourismus einsetzbar werden.„Wir freuen uns unter den Gewinnern der 5G Challenge der Stadt Wien zu sein. Wir können somit vorzeitig die dynamischen Fähigkeiten von 5G nutzen, um Wiens reiche Geschichte in interaktive Augmented Reality-Erlebnisse umzusetzen. Das Projekt passt perfekt zu Azoomees Mission, Kindern Spaß am Lernen zu ermöglichen,“ freut sich Douglas Lloyd, CEO von Azoomee über den Ausgang der 5G Use Case Challenge. Das österreichische eHealth Unternehmen Scarletred zielt mit seiner telemedizinischen Lösung auf den Pflegenotstand im Bereich der häuslichen dezentralen Behandlung chronischer Wunden ab. „Wir freuen uns ganz besonders über den Sieg in der Kategorie Gesundheit und bedanken uns vor allem für das Vertrauen in unser Medizinproduktsystem. Die neue Partnerschaft zwischen Scarletred und der A1 Telekom Austria und die hierdurch ermöglichte frühzeitige Nutzung von 5G, liefert die einzigartige Möglichkeit einen per AI unterstützten telemedizinischen Service für die Stadt Wien und deren Bevölkerung aufzubauen,“ freut sich Dr. Harald Schnidar, CEO Scarletred.Das Medizinproduktsystem von Scarletred ist voll mobil und daher jederzeit und überall einsetzbar, zudem werden die gesammelten Daten anonymisiert gespeichert. Seit 2015 wird die Software international bei der Entwicklung neuer Arzneimittel und Therapien von pharmazeutischen Unternehmen und Medizinern im Rahmen von klinischen Studien und seit Anfang 2019 in Pilotstudien angewendet. Dank dieses Systems können neue Wirkstoffe leichter bewertet, die Forschung beschleunigt und sichere Therapien für Patienten entwickelt werden. Zudem können Sozialversicherungen enorme Kosten einsparen, da ineffiziente Pflegemaßnahmen früher erkannt und entsprechende Maßnahmen getroffen werden können. Die 5G Vienna Use Case ChallengeMit der „5G Vienna Use Case Challenge“ für Startups, Technologie- und Industrieunternehmen setzt die Stadt Wien ihren Digitalisierungsschwerpunkt fort. Mit 400.000 Euro gefördert werden konkrete Anwendungen der 5G Technologie, die Realisierung der Pilotprojekte erfolgt in Kooperation mit Partnerunternehmen aus der Mobilfunkbranche.Neue 5G Lösungen sollen dazu dienen, die Lebensqualität der Bevölkerung weiter zu erhöhen und deren Leben einfacher und sicherer zu gestalten.

Mit A1 Net Protect bringt A1 ein Security Produkt für ganz Österreich auf den Markt, das bereits auf Netzebene Sicherheit bietet und es so Cyberkriminellen erschwert, an die Daten des Users heranzukommen. A1 Net Protect ist auf allen Betriebssystemen und Endgeräten nutzbar, ohne Anschaffung und Installation einer zusätzlichen App, Software oder Hardware. A1 Net Protect ist seit dem 16. März für alle A1 Kunden um 1,90 Euro/ Monat verfügbar und kann über www.a1.net/sicher-im-netz angemeldet werden.

Das Start Up schützt demnach Netzwerke und User gegen Botnets, Ransomware, Spyware oder Phishing. Whalebone greift unabhängig von der aktuellen Lebensphase der schadhaften Software ein: vor dem Download, bevor auf die gefährliche Domain zugegriffen wird, aber auch, wenn die Malware bereits am Gerät ist und mit ihrem Command & Control Center zu kommunizieren versucht.Whalebone konzentriert sich vor allem auf die Namensauflösung der DNS auf Netzwerk Ebene. Somit deckt der Whalebone-Schutz alle Geräte des Netzwerks ab, also auch jene, die sehr kompliziert oder gar nicht gesichert werden können, weil keine passende App oder auch nur ein Interface dafür verfügbar ist. Whalebone ist damit auch bestens geeignet, Smart Home-Gadgets, wie zum Beispiel smarte Thermostate oder Kameras, abzusichern. Das Service wird in Echtzeit aktualisiert und upgedated, daher werden die Nutzer jederzeit gegen die neuesten Bedrohungen geschützt.

Dies haben auch bereits andere Länder in Europa erkannt und so wird die App inzwischen in 24 Sprachen angeboten. Neben Schulen sind auch Kindergärten zu einer stark wachsenden Usergruppe geworden, weshalb eine eigens auf Kindergärten zugeschnittene App namens KidsFox released wurde. Knapp 2.000 Kindergärten nutzen die App bereits. Das Bundesland Niederösterreich stellt KidsFox bereits all ihren 1.050 Kindergärten kostenlos zur Verfügung. Beide Apps werden unter die Dachmarke „Fox Education“ gestellt und treten mit neuem Design und Logo auf.

Die Start Ups vom A1 Start Up Campus stellen deshalb spezielle Angebote für SchülerInnen und LehrerInnen zur Verfügung. „A1 versucht momentan alles, um die Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner unseres Landes in der Bewältigung dieser Situation bestmöglich zu unterstützen. Ich freue mich sehr, dass auch die Start Ups auf dem A1 Start Up Campus einen so wichtigen Beitrag leisten“, so A1 CEO Marcus Grausam. Schoolfox stellt seinen Schulmessenger bis Schuljahresende kostenlos zur Verfügung. Wenn die Schulen geschlossen sind bzw. nur für die Betreuung einiger weniger öffnen, hilft der Schoolmessenger SchoolFox, die Kommunikation mit allen Eltern oder auch SchülerInnen einfach und übersichtlich abzuwickeln. Informationen können rasch versendet, Lernstoff verteilt, Fortschritte erhoben und Rückfragen gestellt werden. SchülerInnen können sich in von LehrerInnen moderierten Gruppen themenspezifisch austauschen.

Unsere Zusammenarbeit mit dem steirischen Start-up Invenium ist ein gutes Beispiel für den Einsatz innovativer Technologien aus Österreich und den erfolgreichen Ausbau eines umfangreichen digitalen Ökosystems gemeinsam mit unseren Partnern aus Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft. Das daraus resultierende Produkt „A1 Mobility Insights“ hat sich bereits bei der Corona-Krisenbewältigung als hilfreich erwiesen und kann sich nun auch durch den Beitritt zum HERE Marketplace im Wettbewerb mit den weltweit größten Anbietern behaupten. Damit ist diese Kooperation auch ein Erfolgsbeispiel für den wichtigen Aufbau einer europäischen Datenökonomie“, so A1 Group CEO, Mag. Thomas Arnoldner. Invenium ist ein Start Up, das aus einem Spin-off der TU Graz und des Grazer Know-Centers hervorgegangen ist. Seit 2017 ist Invenium Member des „A1 Start Up Campus“, der junge Unternehmen bei der Realisierung von Innovationen durch die Bereitstellung von Know-how und Infrastruktur unterstützt. Durch die nun erfolgte Übernahme der Mehrheit an Invenium baut A1 den Bereich der Bewegungsdaten-Analysen aus und bietet mit A1 Mobility Insights ein kommerzielles Produkt auf Basis der TÜV-geprüften und datenschutzkonformen Plattform an. Invenium war das erste Spin-off des Know-Centers an der TU Graz, das mit den Einnahmen, die sich aus diesem Exit ergeben, Forschungskosten ersetzt und zugleich neue Forschungsarbeiten finanziert. „Die steirischen Kompetenzzentren, wie insbesondere das Know-Center, sind Motoren für die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Wissenschaft und Wirtschaft. Sie schaffen ein optimales Umfeld, damit zukunftsweisende Unternehmen wie Invenium entstehen können“, so Wirtschafts- und Forschungslandesrätin, MMag.a Barbara Eibinger-Miedl, die hierbei die zentrale Bedeutung dieses steirischen Start Ups unterstreicht: „Die Digitalisierung bietet neue Chancen, die wir nützen müssen, um die aktuelle Krise zu meistern und wieder auf den Erfolgsweg zu kommen. Genau hier setzt Invenium an und liefert wichtige Erkenntnisse, die etwa für Touristikerinnen und Touristiker, Unternehmen sowie Regionen und Gemeinden höchst relevant sind.“ „A1 Start Up Campus“ und Forschungskooperationen fördern Innovation Dipl.-Ing. Michael Cik, Founder und CSO von Invenium: „Der Einstieg der A1 Telekom Austria Group im Jahr 2017, sowie die Aufstockung der Beteiligungsanteile sind ein Beweis, dass wir mit der Analyse von Bewegungsdaten frühzeitig einen „Need“ erkannt haben und über die letzten Jahre auf dem richtigen Weg sind. Das noch engere Zusammenrücken der beiden Unternehmen gibt uns die Möglichkeit, noch größer zu denken und technologische sowie organisatorische Unternehmensentwicklungen auch international noch effektiver und effizienter durchzuführen. Ich freue mich auf den intensiven Austausch und blicke voller Zuversicht in die Zukunft von A1 Mobility Insights.“ Univ.-Prof. Dr. Martin Fellendorf, Leiter des Instituts für Straßen- und Verkehrswesen der TU Graz, gratuliert Invenium zu dem wirtschaftlichen Erfolg: „Für einen Wissenschaftler ist es eine besondere Bestätigung, wenn die grundlegenden Forschungen, die vor zehn Jahren mit der Integration von Verkehrsmodellen und Mobilfunkdaten als neuer Datenquelle begonnen wurden, zu einem praktischen Nutzen führen.“ Spin-off Initiative des Know-Centers Als ein führendes europäisches Forschungszentrum für Data-driven Business und Artificial Intelligence bietet das Know-Center Unternehmen die Möglichkeit, sich mit Investitionen zu beteiligen und dadurch technologische Disruptionen und Innovationen voranzutreiben, die im klassischen Unternehmensumfeld oft nicht leicht umsetzbar sind. Auf diese Weise werden Kompetenzen aus Wissenschaft, Politik und Wirtschaft zusammengeführt und eine optimale Ausgangslage für erfolgreiche Start-Ups geschaffen. Gegründet 2016 als Spin-off der TU Graz und als damals erstes Spin-off des Know-Centers, ist Invenium bislang das Einzige, aus dem sich das Know-Center als Eigentümer zurückzieht. Mit den Einnahmen, die sich aus dem Exit ergeben, werden die Forschungskosten ersetzt und zugleich neue Forschungsarbeiten am Know-Center finanziert. Ein Teil dieser Erträge fließt in die unternehmerischen Aktivitäten des Know-Centers, um weitere Spin-offs ins Leben zu rufen. „Das Know-Center als COMET-Kompetenzzentrum sieht es als seine gesellschaftliche Verantwortung, Fördergeld in Form von Spin-offs wieder zurück in den Standort fließen zu lassen. Dadurch gelingt es uns, Forschungsergebnisse optimal zu verwerten und Arbeitsplätze in einem Zukunftsfeld zu schaffen. Unsere Vision ist, in den nächsten zehn Jahren weitere zehn Spin-offs zu gründen, um die digitale Transformation in Österreich voranzutreiben. Dafür sind wir auf der Suche nach Investoren, die diesen Weg mit uns gehen.“, so Univ.-Prof. Dipl.-Inf. Dr. Stefanie Lindstaedt, CEO Know-Center. „COMET-Zentren wie das Know-Center geben Österreich eine echte Vorreiterrolle, wenn es darum geht, den digitalen Wandel und insbesondere die Entwicklung betreffend Data-driven Business und Artificial Intelligence nachhaltig voranzutreiben. Das Spin-off Invenium bestätigt den nachhaltigen Erfolg des Spitzenforschungsprogramms COMET, das maßgeblich die Forschung und den Kompetenzaufbau am Know-Center ermöglicht“, betonen die beiden Geschäftsführer der Österreichischen Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft FFG, Henrietta Egerth und Klaus Pseiner. COMET wird partnerschaftlich aus Mitteln des Wirtschafts- und des Klimaschutzministeriums finanziert und dient als Keimzelle innovativer kooperativer Forschung, wie das Spin-off Invenium beweist. „Der Kompetenzaufbau im Bereich digitaler Mobilitätsanalysen stärkt den Forschungsstandort und den Wirtschaftsstandort Österreich, Arbeitsplätze werden langfristig gesichert und neu geschaffen“, so die beiden FFG-Geschäftsführer. A1 Mobility Insights: Woher kommen meine Kunden? In vielen Bereichen der Wirtschaft und des kommunalen Lebens spielt die Frage der geografischen Herkunft der Gäste, KundenInnen oder PendlerInnen eine immer zentralere Rolle. So ist es zum Beispiel für TouristikerInnen spannend zu wissen, welche Gäste Sehenswürdigkeiten in welcher Reihenfolge und zu welchen Uhrzeiten verstärkt frequentieren. Aber auch Städte und Gemeinden benötigen zur Verkehrsplanung tiefe Einblicke in das Mobilitätsverhalten ihrer BürgerInnen. Mit A1 Mobility Insights stellt A1 ein Dashboard zur Verfügung, das diese Fragen beantworten kann. Dabei werden anonymisierte und pseudonymisierte Daten aus dem Mobilfunknetz von A1 kumuliert und analysiert. Ein Rückschluss auf einzelne Personen ist per Design nicht möglich. Mit der Teilnahme am HERE Marketplace bietet die A1 Telekom Austria Group anonymisierte und aggregierte Bewegungsanalysen auch über internationale Plattformen an. Als Unternehmen der A1 Telekom Austria Group verpflichtet sich Invenium zur Einhaltung höchster Standards bei Datenschutz und Informationssicherheit und setzt umfangreiche Maßnahmen, um die Sicherheit der Daten von Kundinnen und Kunden zu gewährleisten. Die Bewegungsanalysen von A1 Mobility Insights sind TÜV-zertifiziert und DSGVO-konform.","https://www.a1startup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PK-A1-Invenium.jpg","2020-12-01","de",0.989150702953339,5.17021344421664e-05,0.988024324178696,6.56678039376857e-05,0.0118582113645971

Die Veranstaltung ist Teil einer lokal organisierten Afterwork-Networking-Reihe, die in Ergänzung zum jährlichen Corporate Startup Summit ins Leben gerufen wurde. Diskutiert wurde nicht nur intensiv über die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Corporates und Start Ups und die Bereitschaft von Corporates, sich auf neue Wege der Zusammenarbeit einzulassen. Martin Eder, früher jahrelang für Entrepreneurship und Innovation beim Telekommunikations- und Verkehrstelematikkonzern Kapsch zuständig, sprach in seinem Talk über „angewandten digitalen Darwinismus“ über das „Bunch of Hipsters in a Garage“-Syndrom: Noch immer haben alteingesessene Unternehmer oft das Bild einiger in Garagen sitzender Hipster vor Augen, wenn sie an Start Ups denken. Am Bewusstsein, was Start Ups leisten und mit wieviel Know how und Professionalität sie agieren, muss also noch gearbeitet werden. In der anschließenden Podiumsdiskussion danach mit dabei: Markus Bernhart, CEO von ready2order, Michael Petritz, Partner bei KPMG, Alexander Koll, COO Werkstätte Wattens by Swarovski und Gemeinde Wattens und Erwald Hesse, CEO bei Grid Singularity.

Mit dabei am Podium waren neben der A1 HR-Chefin Sabine Bothe der CEO von Grape, Felix Häusler, der Chef von Telehaase Markus Stelzmann und Richard Hübner, Geschäftsführer von dignit. Publikum und Podium erzielten sehr rasch darüber Einigkeit, dass das E-Mail im privaten Bereich kaum mehr eine Rolle spielt – und das über alle Generationen hinweg. Im Business Bereich ist es allerdings nach wie vor so, dass die Inboxen von MitarbeiterInnen übergehen und das „cc und bcc Setzen“ eine wahre E-Mail Flut verursacht. Die Folge davon: Weniger Effizienz, kein Überblick, weniger Produktivität – so die Diskutanten. Neue Tools wie Workplace, das aktuell bei A1 eingeführt wird, oder Grape, einem anderen Team Messenger, möchten genau hier ansetzen. Kein einfaches Unterfangen für Großunternehmen wie auch KMUs. Denn Team Messenger verändern die Kommunikationskultur eines Unternehmens gehörig: Über die Ansprache und Reihenfolge der Adressaten in einem Posting oder einer Message denkt man zum Beispiel meist deutlich weniger lang nach als bei einem E-Mail – so ein Teilnehmer aus dem Publikum.","https://www.a1startup.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/384f041253f7aa9107b651e5d992d431_f171.jpg","2018-01-01","de",0.996369123458862,8.38720225146972e-05,0.986856400966644,0.00289757503196597,0.0101621272042394

"https://www.a1startup.net/going-global-aber-wie/","A1Startup","Going global – aber wie?","Erfolgreiche Start Ups denken größer – besonders wenn es um den Erfolg ihrer Idee geht. Somit stellt sich wohl jedes Start Up irgendwann die Frage, wie es sein Produkt bzw. sein Service auch international positionieren kann. Keine leichte Aufgabe, vor allem, wenn man die Zielmärkte nicht kennt. Der A1 Start Up Campus und die Wirtschaftsagentur Wien (www.wirtschaftsagentur.at) haben aus diesem Grund interessierte Start Ups zu einem Austausch gebeten. Nach kurzen Inputs von A1 (www.a1.net) , indoo.rs (www.indoo.rs) und OVOS (www.ovos.at) wurde intensiv diskutiert. Fazit: Wenn du einen Markt erobern willst, lerne ihn kennen, und zwar nicht nur digital. Ein Aufenthalt vor Ort, der Kontakt zu Natives, ein erstes Verständnis welche kulturellen Dos & Don‘ts es gibt, sind Goldes wert. Genauso wie ein Steuerberater vor Ort. Ein weiterer wertvoller Tipp: Referenzprojekte & „show off!“ Wer spannende und bekannte Projekte an Land zieht, hat tolle Referenzen. Und wenn man damit oft auch nicht das große Cash verdient, können sie international den Durchbruch bedeuten.

Wir waren wieder mit dabei und haben die „TGM – Schule der Technik“ am A1 Start Up Campus begrüßt: Unser Programmpunkt drehte sich um das Thema „Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Start Ups und Corporates – Was bringt’s?“ Dabei sind wir vor allem der Frage nachgegangen, warum sich diese beiden unterschiedlichen Unternehmensformen überhaupt brauchen. Immer mehr Unternehmen wollen mit Start Ups kooperieren. Was bedeutet das für ein Start Up? Welche Chancen sind damit verbunden und wo kann es schwierig werden? Die A1 Start Ups Parkbob, ready2order und Invenium berichteten in einem Talk, wie sie die Zusammenarbeit mit einem großen Unternehmen erleben und das A1 Start Up Team erklärte was Corporates davon haben – das Wichtigste dabei ist jedoch vor allem: Innovation. Ein besonders anschaulicher Vergleich, den Mario Mayerthaler, Head of A1 Start Up Campus, vor kurzem beschrieben hatte, fasst dies gut zusammen: Corporates sind wie Öltanker am Meer, stabil und groß, wenn sie allerdings ihren Kurs ändern wollen, dann dauert das und es braucht Zeit, bis sich das große Konstrukt in eine andere Richtung bewegt. Start Ups hingegen sind wie Speedboate. Sie sind wendig und schnell und können ihren Kurs ohne viel Vorbereitung ändern. Als einer der ersten Start Up Campi Wiens, freut es uns jedes Mal aufs Neue jungen, interessierten Menschen näher zu bringen wie Gründen funktionieren kann und was wir zur Unterstützung junger Gründer beitragen können.

In der Smartphone-App können Kurse zu verschiedenen Schulbüchern oder beispielsweise ein Maturatraining Mathematik gebucht werden. LehrerInnen können eSquirrel in den Unterricht integrieren und für Hausübungen oder Tests verwenden. Aktuell nutzen rund 20.000 Schüler und Lehrer eSquirrel österreichweit. „Die immer dynamischer werdende Arbeitswelt erfordert lebenslanges Lernen. Gerade deshalb soll Lernen mehr denn je Spaß machen. eSquirrel zeigt mit ihrem Lernbegleiter, wie Digitalisierung sinnvoll in den Schulalltag integriert und Lernprozesse spielerisch für unsere Kinder gestaltet werden können“, freut sich Thomas Arnoldner, CEO A1 Group, über die Kooperation. „Mit eSquirrel wollen wir das Schulbuch ins 21. Jahrhundert holen. Wir haben uns gefragt, wie es in der Schule besser gelingen kann, Schüler und Schülerinnen zu motivieren, auch zwischen den Unterrichtseinheiten ein bisschen zu wiederholen, Vokabeln zu lernen oder zum Beispiel Grammatik zu üben“, erzählt Wittberger, wie alles begonnen hat. Kooperationen mit Schulbuchverlagen garantieren maßgeschneiderte InhalteeSquirrel konnte namhafte österreichische Schulbuchverlage wie ÖBV, Veritas oder Lemberger von ihrer Idee überzeugen: Die Inhalte der App sind optimal auf die jeweiligen Schulbücher abgestimmt, die Schüler finden in den Lehrbüchern QR Codes, mit deren Hilfe sie zu den passenden Lernquizzes in der App gelangen. Umgekehrt können sie bei Erklärungsbedarf in der App auf die digitale Version ihrer Schulbücher zugreifen. Zudem werden die Inhalte neben den Quizzes von Audio- und Videodateien begleitet. In einem Kommissionsgutachten des Bildungsministeriums für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung wird eSquirrel als „abwechslungsreiches und die Eigenaktivität der SchülerInnen anregendes Tool“ bestätigt. „eSquirrel stellt mit der quasi automatischen Wiederholung der einzelnen Stoffgebiete, der Belohnungsdramaturgie und den Verwaltungsmöglichkeiten für LehrerInnen didaktisch eine gelungene Bereicherung dar“, so die Experten des BMBWF weiter. Durch dieses Gutachten wurden eSquirrel-Kurse offiziell als E-Book Plus approbiert und können von Schülern im Rahmen der Schulbuchaktion verwendet werden. Neues Unterrichtstool für Lehrer: Gamification motiviert SchülerDie App ist, was Funktionen und Design betrifft, gaming-basiert. In verschiedenen Levels sammeln die Kinder für jede richtige Frage Nüsse. Je mehr Nüsse gesammelt werden, desto besser sind die Schüler im jeweiligen Fachgebiet. Um für Ansporn zu sorgen, werden die besten 33% einer Klasse für alle sichtbar gezeigt: Ziel sollte also sein, selber im ersten Drittel zu sein und somit auf dem Leaderboard zu erscheinen. Alle Ränge dahinter sieht nur das jeweilige Kind selbst.Auch für Lehrer bietet die App zahlreiche Vorteile: So kann die App für Hausübungen und Tests, sowie Stundenwiederholungen, genutzt werden. Lehrer müssen einzelne Aufgaben nicht selbst korrigieren, sondern erhalten dank Learning Analytics detailliert Auskunft über Stärken und Schwächen des jeweiligen Schülers. Auch die Kinder erhalten direktes Feedback und können ihre Lernfortschritte selbst messen. eSquirrel: Lernbegleiter in und über die Schulzeit hinausDigitale Grundbildung als verbindliche Übung in der Neuen Mittelschule und AHS Unterstufe wurde ebenso in der App implementiert und steht den Lehrkräften seit Herbst 2018 kostenlos zur Verfügung. Darüber hinaus unterstützt die App nach der Schulzeit weiter beim Lernen: Etwa bei der Vorbereitung auf die Berufsreife- oder Medizinaufnahmeprüfung. Auch Vereine verwenden die App, um zum Beispiel das Lernen für einen Segelschein zu erleichtern.

Der WKO zufolge fehlen bereits jetzt in Österreich 10.000 IT-Fachkräfte und europaweit wird 2020 bereits mit einer Lücke von einer Million fehlender IT-Jobs gerechnet. „Durch die Digitalisierung aller Lebensbereiche steigt der Bedarf an qualifizierten Arbeitskräften in der IT. Die Aufnahme von ITjobsaustria in das A1 Start Up Programm ist eine Möglichkeit, dem Fachkräftemangel, den auch wir als Unternehmen im Recruiting erleben, aktiv entgegenzuwirken“, erklärt Thomas Arnoldner, CEO A1 Telekom Austria Group, den Mehrwert der Partnerschaft. Exklusiv für IT-Fachkräfte: Maßgeschneidertes Job-PortalDer Steirer Mario Rosin (42), seit 20 Jahren Unternehmer in der IT Branche, kennt die Bedürfnisse von IT-Fachkräften und ist überzeugt, dass diese Zielgruppe nicht mit herkömmlichen Jobportalen optimal bedient werden kann. „Programmierer ticken anders, grundsätzlich sind sie wechselwillig was ihren Job angeht, benötigen aber andere und detailliertere Informationen, wenn sie bessere Jobangebote suchen“, erklärt Rosin, Co-Founder ITjobsaustria, die Motivation für das neue Portal. Aus diesem Grund orientiert sich ITjobsaustria an den speziellen Bedürfnissen der IT-Fachkräfte. „IT-Fachkräfte können aktuell am Arbeitsmarkt zwischen vielen Angeboten wählen. Sie wollen auf den ersten Blick wissen, welches Unternehmen sucht, mit welchen Tools und DevOps sie arbeiten werden, ob sie in einem Großraumbüro sitzen oder welche Arbeitszeitmodelle möglich sind“, gibt Mario Rosin Einblicke. ITjobsaustria erfordert auch ein Umdenken und neue Chancen für Unternehmen. Ein höheres Maß an Transparenz und detailliertere Informationen erhöhen die Attraktivität der Arbeitgeber im IT-Bereich. „Unternehmen werden immer stärker in ihr Employer Branding investieren müssen, um attraktiv für potentielle Mitarbeiter zu sein. Im IT-Bereich ist diese Herausforderung besonders groß und unser Portal kann hier einen wesentlichen Beitrag leisten. Mit A1 haben wir einen idealen Partner gefunden, der ab sofort seine IT-Jobs über unsere Plattform anbietet“, freut sich der Salzburger Raphael Huber (34), Co-Founder ITjobsaustria. A1 ist aktuell beim Trendence Award als „beliebtester Arbeitgeber in der Telekommunikations-Branche“ ausgezeichnet worden und als Zweitplatzierter in der Kategorie „Beliebtester Arbeitgeber für Technologie-Studierende“ (1). Was unterscheidet ITjobsaustria von anderen Anbietern?ITjobsaustria hat in Summe 14 auf IT Fachkräfte maßgeschneiderte Kategorien festgelegt – das inserierende Unternehmen entscheidet selbst, wie viele Daten es veröffentlichen möchte. Der Programmierer sieht die Vollständigkeit der Informationen auf den ersten Blick. Die strukturiert erhobenen Daten einer ausgeschriebenen Stelle machen die Jobanzeigen somit auch direkt miteinander vergleichbar. Sollte für den wechselwilligen Programmierer aktuell keine für ihn ideale Stelle offen sein, so benachrichtigt der Suchagent von www.itjobsaustria.at automatisch per E-Mail über neue, passende Angebote. Verdeckte Stellenangebote von Personaldienstleister sind nicht im Sinne der IT-Fachkräfte und somit auf der Plattform auch nicht möglich. ITjobsaustria ist aktuell kostenfrei.","https://www.a1startup.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/045_20190704web.jpg","2020-02-01","de",0.989744544029236,1.32882651087129e-05,0.996512711048126,0.000429758365498856,0.00304428860545158

Welche Start Ups das sind, wer alles beim Networking war und was die A1 Vorstände Magarete Schramböck und Marcus Grausam dazu sagen, könnt ihr hier nachlesen. Am 17. Februar präsentierten sich im Rahmen der oberösterreichischen Leitinitiative Digitalisierung 6 Start Ups aus Oberösterreich am A1 Start Up Campus. Ziel der Initiative ist es, den Wirtschaftsstandort Österreich zu stärken indem Österreich attraktiver für Start Ups wird. „Start-ups sind zu einem wesentlichen Teil der österreichischen Wirtschaft geworden, sie sind für mehr als ein Drittel aller neuen Jobs jährlich verantwortlich. Deshalb unterstützen wir die Start-up-Szene bereits seit mehr als fünf Jahren. Ihre Innovationskraft und ihr Speed helfen uns, neue maßgeschneiderte Produkte und Services für unsere Kunden zu entwickeln. Das Ziel Oberösterreichs, eine Modellregion für datengetriebene Wirtschaft zu werden, ist die perfekte Basis um attraktiver Nährboden für die Start-up-Szene zu sein“, so Margarete Schramböck. Landesrat Strugel möchte mit der Gründerstrategie „Start Up(per) Austria“ das Gründungspotenzial von Oberösterreich besser ausschöpfen und motivierte Menschen mit guten Ideen zum Gründen ermutigen. Ein wichtiger Teil davon ist die Vernetzung und die Möglichkeit zu Kooperationen mit anderen Start-up-Plattformen wie z.B. dem A1 Start-up Campus. A1 CTO Marcus Grausam, der selbst Oberösterreicher ist, ergänzt: „Oberösterreich hat mit seiner Leitinitiative Digitalisierung und den bestehenden Bildungseinrichtungen alle Zutaten, um ein wirklicher Hotspot für Start-ups zu werden – auch der Infrastrukturausbau ist dafür entscheidend. Um die Wirtschaftskraft im ländlichen Raum zu stärken und für Unternehmen optimale Rahmenbedingungen bereitstellen zu können, legt A1 großen Wert auf den österreichweiten Ausbau des Glasfasernetzes.“ Um diese Brücke zwischen Oberösterreich und Wien zu bauen, pitchten folgende 6 Start Ups aus OÖ: View Elevator: Aufzugsmonitoring – Armin Braunsberger OpenIDA: Industriedatenauswertung – Andreas Egleseer Wardo: Onlinebefragung mit neuem Geschäftsmodell – D.

Mit der neuen Parking-App wird den Kunden von ALD Automotive zum einen die Parkplatzsuche erleichtert, zum anderen wird auf Parkregeln hingewiesen, was den Fahrern, Fuhrparkmanagern und Unternehmen unter anderem Zeit in der Verwaltung von Parkstrafen spart. Mithilfe der App werden die Kunden von ALD Automotive über Parkregeln informiert und wissen genau, wo und wie lange sie parken dürfen und, sofern ein Parkplatz gebührenpflichtig ist, wie hoch die Parkgebühren sind. Hat man sein Auto dennoch falsch geparkt, informiert ein Alert nach dem Einparken automatisch über die Parksituation und schützt so vor unnötigen Parkstrafen. „Wir freuen uns, mit Parkbob einen wertvollen Technologiepartner gewonnen zu haben und sind davon überzeugt, unseren Kunden mit ALD Park einen deutlichen Mehrwert bieten zu können“, freut sich Martin Kössler, Geschäftsführer der ALD Automotive Fuhrparkmanagement und Leasing GmbH. Nach erfolgreichem Ablauf des 3-monatigen Piloten soll die App in die globale Fuhrpark-App „My ALD“ integriert werden. „ALD Park hat den Kundennutzen im Fokus. Mit der App sparen Fahrer und Fuhrparkmanager jeden Tag Zeit, Geld und Nerven. Wir freuen uns auf die weitere Zusammenarbeit mit ALD Automotive“, erklärt Christian Adelsberger, CEO und Gründer von Parkbob. Durch dieses wichtige Partnerschaftsabkommen kann das Startup seine Lösung weiter entwickeln und noch präzisere Ergebnisse für Parklösungen liefern.

Diese innovative Methode ist sowohl für öffentliche Einrichtungen als auch den privaten Gebrauch sicher und einfach anzuwenden.„Wir freuen uns, Urisalt als hochtechnologisches e-Health Produkt aus Tirol mit unserem Marketing- und Vertriebs-Know-How unterstützen zu können. Als Digitalisierungspartner für Start Ups können wir die fachlichen Kompetenzen von Jungunternehmern mit unserem unternehmerischen Wissen ergänzen und sie dabei unterstützen, den Markteintritt zu schaffen. Wir sind auch stolz, dass unsere Tochter World-Direct die Software für die innovativen Medizingeräte entwickelt,“ so A1 Group CEO Thomas Arnoldner über das Start Up Engagement von A1.Was steht hinter UriSalt?Das Tiroler Start Up UriSalt, ein gemeinsames Spin off der beiden Innsbrucker Universitäten, wurde von der Chemikerin Dr. Gerda Fuhrmann, der Unternehmensberaterin und Chemikerin Dr. Pinar Kilickiran und von Priv. Doz. Dr. med. Peter Heinz-Erian, Mitarbeiter der Pädiatrie der Medizinische Universität Innsbruck, gegründet. Mit SODISENS bringt UriSalt nun sein erstes Produkt auf den Markt. Dabei handelt es sich um einen kostengünstigen Point-of-Care-Test zur Beurteilung des Natriumhaushaltes mittels Einmal-Urinstreifen und eines tragbaren Analyse-GerätsUrisalt als Game Changer in der MedizinAktuell ist noch eine Laboruntersuchung sowie eine invasive Blutuntersuchung notwendig, um den Elektrolytstatus eines Patienten ermitteln zu können. Störungen des Elektrolytgleichgewichts treffen weltweit Milliarden Menschen und können zu schweren gesundheitlichen Komplikationen führen, wenn sie nicht rechtzeitig erkannt und behandelt werden. Die neue Technologie kann für zahlreiche weitere Mineralstoffe angewendet werden, die entsprechenden Testgeräte werden bereits im Labor untersucht und die Patente gesichert. „Das Marktpotenzial ist immens. Alleine im DACH-Raum leben 18 Millionen Patienten mit Bluthochdruck, die einen erhöhten Natriumspiegel strikt vermeiden sollten“, so Dr. Kilickiran. „Wir wussten, dass diese Technologie bahnbrechend ist und Menschen das Leben leichter machen wird. Das ist unsere größte Motivation“, führt Dr. Fuhrmann weiter aus. „Die innovative Testmethode bedeutet im medizinischen und privaten Gebrauch eine enorme Entwicklung und steigert durch die Möglichkeit der häufigen Selbstkontrolle die Lebensqualität der Patienten“, freut sich Dr. med. Heinz-Erian.","https://www.a1startup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/002_16.-Oktober-2019_324A3182-scaled.jpg","2020-06-01","de",0.995723247528076,7.52038686187007e-05,0.951302766799927,6.12461226410232e-05,0.048560805618763

Das wissen alle, die das Privileg haben, hier zu leben und zu arbeiten. Und auch Studien bestätigen immer wieder die hohe Lebensqualität dieser Stadt. Beim .roundtable von brutkasten und A1 stand Wiens Smartness auf dem Prüfstand. Und vor allem wurde der Frage nachgegangen, ob Start Ups in den nächsten Jahren Österreichs Bundeshauptstadt noch smarter machen werden. Die Antwort war deutlich: Start Ups werden ihren Beitrag leisten, oft vielleicht nicht im Alleingang, aber gemeinsam mit „traditionellen“ Unternehmen oder einer Stadtverwaltung. „Viele frische, kreative Ideen entstehen aus konkreten Problemen, die die Bürger haben,“ unterstrich zum Beispiel Ingrid Vogel , CEO beim Klima und Energiefonds. Und eben nicht wenn Verantwortliche in Gremien und Workshops hinter verschlossener Tür darüber nachdenken. Christian Adelsberger von parkbob (www.parkbob.com) hat an diesem Abend deutlich gemacht, wie aus einem konkreten Problem eine Idee entsteht, die nicht nur ihm und seiner Familie, sondern allen Autofahrern in Wien das Leben leichter macht und ganz nebenbei auch ökologisch interessant ist. Und genau solche Ideen sind auch in Zukunft gefragt weiß A1 Technik-Vorstand Marcus Grausam: Der A1 Start Up Campus freut sich über viele neue spannende Ideen (a1startup@a1telekom.at), die Smart Living in Zukunft Wirklichkeit werden lassen. Wieso Wien Vorbild für Tokyo ist, CIO Ulrike Huemer an der Fehlerkultur in der Stadt Wien arbeiten möchte und warum es für Start Ups oft schwierig ist, sich in Smart City Projekte zu involvieren, kann man im Brutkasten nachlesen.","https://www.a1startup.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/c57a2d9edbe319efb8a6aac2ae2dac94_f148.jpg","2016-05-01","de",0.999418318271637,0.00135915447026491,0.51092666387558,0.0015056396368891,0.486208528280258

Mit warrify speichert der Kunde seine Kaufbelege via QR-Code zentral in einer Web-App und hat so immer Zugriff auf Garantie-Leistungen oder andere wichtige Daten. Im Gegenzug kann der Händler zielgerichtet Kunden mit passenden Services ansprechen und so Services, wie zum Beispiel Garantieverlängerungen oder Vergünstigungen bei Nachfolge-Modellen, anbieten, ohne ein Loyality-Programm aufsetzen zu müssen.

Das Edu-Tech Start-up setzt mit seiner Lehrplan-basierten App YooQuiz (www.yooquiz.com) auf spielerisches Lernen – ob alleine, mit Freunden, in einer Community oder in der Familie. Die YooQuiz App unterstützt SchülerInnen von der Volksschule bis zur Matura beim effizienten und spielerischen Lernen und Wiederholen des Unterrichtsstoffes und kann auch von LehrerInnen für den Unterricht verwendet werden. Yoovis Education arbeitet auf Hochtouren, um ab Herbst sein gesamtes Lernökosystem anzubieten, das die Zusammenarbeit zwischen SchülerInnen, Eltern und LehrerInnen erleichtert. „Die Corona-Krise treibt die Digitalisierung der Schule voran und Start Ups liefern hier einen ganz wesentlichen Beitrag. Gerade jetzt brauchen wir die Unterstützung von digitalen Lernhilfen, die es Schülerinnen und Schülern ermöglichen, zu Hause selbständig weiter zu lernen. Mit Yoovis Education bauen wir den Edu-Tech Bereich am A1 Start Up Campus weiter aus“, erklärt Mario Mayerthaler, Head of Innovation und A1 Start Up Campus die neue Partnerschaft. YooQuiz: Wissens-Liga für unterrichtsrelevante Inhalte Beim YooQuiz kann jeder Lehrplan-basierte Fragen im Trainings-, Single-Player-, Duell oder Gruppen-Modus spielen, oder eigene Gruppen erstellen, in denen er sich mit Freunden und Familie „matcht“, bzw. in einer Wissensliga antritt. LehrerInnen haben zudem die Möglichkeit ganze Klassen oder Schulen als Gruppen anzulegen, wodurch schulinterne und schulübergreifende Turniere möglich sind. Bei den Turnieren stehen unterrichts- und prüfungsrelevante Inhalte im Mittelpunkt. Damit wird nicht nur das spielerische Lernen gefördert und die Lernmotivation erhöht, sondern auch der Wettbewerbs- sowie Teamgeist gesteigert. YooQuiz ist kostenlos und daher das ideale Lernspiel für die Schule, zu Hause und überall. Ab Herbst ist auch das Erstellen eigener Quizze sowie von Teams möglich. Gründerteam aus dem oberösterreichischen Almtal mit Kärntner Expertise „Als ich vor rund 4 Jahren eine digitale Lernunterstützung für meine Kinder suchte, fand ich nichts, das wirklich gut war – weder inhaltlich noch von der Bedienbarkeit her. So habe ich begonnen mich intensiver damit zu beschäftigen und entwickle seit 2017 ein digitales Trainings- und Lernökosystem“, erzählt Christian Stundner aus Gmunden, Gründer und Ideengeber von Yoovis Education. Unterstützt wird er dabei von Werbeagentur-Chef und Yoovis Education CMO Dominik Raberger, der aus dem oberösterreichischen Almtal stammt und die Usability und Vermarktungsstrategie des Start Ups im Fokus hat. Das Gründerteam wird vom Kärntner Startup Experten Mario Orasche komplettiert, der für Finanzierung und Strategie verantwortlich zeichnet. Frühzeitiger Launch aufgrund von Corona: Einladung zur Content Co-Creation! Eigentlich hat das Team von Yoovis Education den Launch für das Wintersemester 2020/2021 geplant. Da digitales Lernen aufgrund von Corona & Homeschooling gefragter denn je ist, startet Yoovis Education aber bereits jetzt mit seiner YooQuiz App. Parallel dazu wird Feature um Feature weiterentwickelt: Ab Herbst 2020 wird neben der App auch die Yoovis Lernplattform, ein offenes Lernökosystem für LehrerInnen, Schülerinnen und Eltern, mit weiterführenden Inhalten und Lerneinheiten in Form von Videos, Lernkarteien, Audio Books etc. zur Verfügung stehen. Lehrer können dabei einfach und kostenlos Klassen anlegen, Inhalte oder ganze Lerneinheiten erstellen und diese v.a. auch digital mit KollegInnen teilen.

This year, the programme was recalibrated, specifically targeting start-ups that have already convinced first customers with their innovation and would like to grow their business both domestically and globally. The joint innovation platform offered by BayWa AG and RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG started the competition in 2016. The objective is the early identification of innovations for the agricultural sector and to support the most promising start-ups regarding their further development and market strategies. 38 out of the 252 applying start-ups are based in the USA, making it the leader of the top ten countries of origin. India follows on the second place with 33 and Germany takes place three with 22 start-ups. Applications were received from companies on all continents. 43 percent of applicants are headquartered in Europe. By far the highest number of applications was submitted for the agriculture technology field with 173 entrants, with many entries in the fields of organic agriculture, crop production overall, nutrition and trade of produce. Over the next few days, the AIL will internally select the 100 most promising start-ups. The first milestones in the competition among the remaining young companies will be their remote pitches, which are scheduled for June. In their pitch, the competing companies will be asked to convince their potential mentors for the Acceleration & Market Entry Programme in a presentation only lasting a few minutes. The finalists will then be invited to the next round, the Finalist Days in Munich. We will know the names of the start-ups that will have made it into this year’s programme in August 2018.

The selected finalists are: Arcis Biotechnology (UK) specialises in the rapid innovative room temperature extraction and stabilisation of nucleic acids. Arcis kits are especially suited to in field extraction of nucleic acids including DNA and RNA, require no specialist equipment and stabilise nucleic acids for up to 90 days at room temperature. Its products have proved particularly attractive to scientists testing for disease in soil, crops and livestock. Biosystems Engineering, or BioE (UK) is active in the application of IoT across the agri-food industry, from farm to table, including precision agriculture and food chain traceability. Its CyberBar technology provides a tamper-proof system for assuring the provenance of food products while also delivering a novel approach to reducing food waste in the home. BlakBear (UK) builds novel chemical sensors, electronics and software to help the world feel, understand and improve itself. From soil and food to air and water quality, in the field and across supply chains, it is pioneering the digital interface to the biochemical world. Blakbear’s latest research focuses on ultra-low-cost packaging sensors for fish and meat products, to reduce waste and prevent food-borne diseases arising from spoiled foods. CCm Technologies (UK) transforms costly waste materials including CO2, ammonia and phosphorus back into valuable, sustainable, ultra-low carbon footprint products, such as fertilisers and plastics, with multiple applications across food, agriculture, wastewater treatment and energy. The technology is economically viable without reliance on government subsidies and will contribute to solving the challenges of GHG emissions and deteriorating soil health. Faromatics (Spain) employs robotics, artificial intelligence and big data to increase animal welfare and farm productivity in intensive animal production. Its flagship product, the ChickenBoy, is the world’s first ceiling-suspended robot that monitors ambient conditions, health and welfare and equipment function for broiler chickens. It is currently being tested in several European countries and full commercialisation will start at the end of 2019. Metronome Technologies (UK) combined hardware and software platform provides best-in-class cold storage management. Unlike traditional cold storage, its system uses AI to predict and actively manage when heating or cooling will be required within pre-defined boundaries, allowing power consumption to be shifted around in the day while keeping produce in optimal conditions. This shift creates new opportunities for matching demand to supply – Metronome has turned the farm into a giant battery, storing renewable energy in vegetables. N2 Applied (Norway) aims to fundamentally improve global food production. N2’s technology enables the farmer to produce fertiliser on the farm from manure or biogas digestate, air and renewable energy. The result is fertiliser produced with lower GHG emissions, that provides a similar yield to mineral fertiliser, at a competitive cost to the farmer. The technology significantly reduces laughing gas, methane and ammonia emissions in the storage and spreading of manure. Proteon Pharmaceuticals (Poland) uses precision biology for microbiome protection to improve animal and human health, increasing environmental sustainability and eliminating the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Its advanced phage technology platform combines genomics, bioinformatics, materials engineering and molecular biology enabling the company to discover, develop and deliver bacteriophages as a means of bacterial control in animal farming. Roboscientific (UK) has developed a new generation of sensors for detecting disease, infestation and contamination in agricultural products using Volatile Organic Compounds. The technology is fast, reliable and affordable and at the point of commercialisation for its automatic early disease detection system for growing broiler poultry and early alerts of spoilage in stored potato and onion crops. SmartBell (UK) is an animal health management platform for livestock. Its real-time monitoring solution uses AI and Internet of Things technology to record vital signs and enables disease detection, helping to decrease costs, achieve optimal growth targets and improve margins. The product is uniquely designed to work from the birth of an animal and is able to track key health information through its life, helping farmers improve profits and producers and supermarkets to improve their supply chain sustainability. Commenting on the entries, Natalie Smith, Head of Agriculture at Tesco, said: “It’s been a challenging but exciting process to review nearly 100 innovative ideas from around the world, offering so much potential to the industry. We’re especially grateful for the input from our supply chain partners for their specialist feedback about how these could be applied in the field. We look forward to working together with at least one of those tech companies after choosing the winner next month.” The Agri T-Jam will take place at Tesco’s HQ in Welwyn Garden City, offering the startups the potential to meet more Tesco colleagues and supplier partners, as well as the summit’s key investor audience.

This is data about agriculture that enables knowledge to be gained faster and more objectively than viaconventional methods. The focus of the discussion in Berlin was digital images that are generated by carrier systems such as satellites, drones or other machines. How can farmers be supported in using such agronomic data? This question was addressed in a panel discussion – with the outcome that concluded that it is not the generation or transmission of such data that is critical, but rather its interpretation. For this reason, it will be important in the future to automate processes in such a way that farmers do not even notice that satellite data is involved. Instead, this data should be interpreted – and recommendations for actions given – automatically. However, we have to keep in mind that satellite images are only superficial images that are not always reliable, as a result of which recommendations for action should be marked with a quality rating. This was also confirmed from a farmer’s perspective. Offers to farmers will increasingly develop from products to services, including in the field of agronomic data. Therefore, an ideal future perspective is that farmers will be able to make more precise field management decisions based on sensor data and to automate and document processes such as fertilization and plant protection. These insights into agronomic data lead us to hope that in future, numerous startups will deal with the interpretation of satellite data. We will stay tuned and constantly screen the market for solutions that could be interesting for RWA and the Lagerhaus cooperatives.","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/csm_Logo_A_FAF_big_6759b1b9dd.png","19.

With it, the Austrian Economic Chamber acknowledges the innovative successes the agricultural start-up accelerator has achieved since its founding in 2016. A total of 650 start-ups from around 70 different countries have so far applied to the AIL’s acceleration program. Ten young companies have successfully completed the program. For two start-ups, this led to an investment by or cooperation with BayWa and RWA. Shortly, the third AIL acceleration program will begin. “Our goal is to play an active part in the future of the agricultural industry and develop innovations for our customers,” said Klaus Josef Lutz, BayWaAG’s chairman of the executive board. “We reach this goal by supporting start-ups all over the world dealing with new technologies and strategies specifically for the agricultural industry.” The director of the AIL, Reinhard Bauer, accepted the award on behalf of the eleven members of his young team. “We have invested a lot of energy in the past years looking for groundbreaking ideas and promising start-ups. I’m proud of what we have achieved, and knowing our initiatives and contributions to both the international and domestic markets are appreciated makes me very happy.” The Global Innovator award was awarded this year for the first time. The accolade was awarded during Austria’s largest export exhibition, the Export Day of the Austrian Economic Chamber.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/ail-is-focusing-on-iot-sustainability-climate-protection-and-automation/","AgroInnovationLab","AIL is focusing on IoT, sustainability & climate protection, and automation.","In addition to the further development of our existing service portfolio and the organization of specific innovation challenges, our focus in 2021 will be on the development of products and services related to our core topics of the Internet of Things (IoT), sustainability & climate protection, and automation. The aim is to ensure that new developments and trends are useful to farmers. IoT & digitalization: In agriculture, the use of sensor technology and the digitalization of processes offer huge potential for increasing efficiency and supporting informed decision-making – for both smaller and larger farms as well as contractors. To this end, AIL is on the lookout for practical solutions, both for location-specific tasks, such as the storage of agricultural products, and for farmers, for whom each step in a process can be automatically documented. The transmission of machine data can ensure the timely delivery of spare parts. Sustainability: Agriculture makes an important contribution to climate protection, which should be both increasingly highlighted and developed further in order to counteract climate change. The European Union’s Farm-to-Fork Strategy, which was presented in 2020, clearly shows that sustainable management in agriculture is a key topic for the future. Agriculture and forestry are the only sectors that have the potential to actively bind CO2 by building up humus in the ground. This is why 2020 also saw the launch of our new Lagerhaus program “Future Earth”, which rewards farmers for their work in the area of sustainable humus formation. This will be followed by the further development of this program, together with the evaluation of ways of reducing methane levels and other climate protection aspects of agriculture. Automation: The Agro Innovation Lab has been focusing on automation for some time. Last year’s Robotics Challenge clearly demonstrated the potential in this area. The task is now to put the suitable devices into practice. In recent months, some robotics developers have been able to arouse interest with new developments, which were also presented at the annual French robotics trade fair “FIRA” at the beginning of December. Our objective in the field of automation is to further expand the Agro Innovation Lab’s pioneering role as a robotics competence partner and to identify the best devices by carrying out practical assignments together with interested farmers. We want to pick up on trends in agriculture and make innovations usable in cooperation with a range of partners, especially farmers. We are always happy to receive suggestions and ideas.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/autonomous-green-space-management/","AgroInnovationLab","Autonomous green space management","In response to the threat of a ban on herbicide use and the increasing shortage of skilled workers, we have started pilot trials of autonomous green space management for large agricultural areas together with Vitirover, a French manufacturer of mowing robots. In 2020, these trials will be carried out in a number of vineyards as well as in an electricity substation. Thanks to our initial successes and high customer demand we are optimistic that we will soon be able to commercialise the service for our customers. As a participant in the Acceleration Program of the Agro Innovation Lab in 2018, Vitirover was able to reach many important commercialisation milestones in cooperation with the technical experts of RWA: – Carrying out of several pilot trials in Austrian vineyards, organised and supervised by AIL, in cooperation with the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences and the Krems School of Viticulture – Expansion of the target group by adding electricity substations, including a pilot test with two Vitirover mowing robots – Technical training of an RWA project manager in St. Emilion, France – Development of the business model “robots as a service” Further information about Vitirover itself can be found here. Project findings The pilot tests confirm high customer demand for autonomous green space management. In the vineyard, precise weed control close to and between the vines is very important. With its front-mounted knife motors, the Vitirover is ideally suited for this. The Vitirover is powered by an integrated photovoltaic module rather than a charging station. The output per unit area fluctuates due to the shadows of the vines and the higher energy requirements caused by uneven ground but can be increased by changing the integrated buffer battery. The optimisation of this output per unit area is the focus of the ongoing pilot tests. The main focus in electricity substations is on the safety of the work process. Here, the output per unit area can be increased by reducing the number of obstacles.

Die Wirtschaftskammer Österreich würdigt damit die Innovationserfolge, die der agrarische Start-up-Accelerator seit seiner Gründung 2016 erreicht hat. Für das Acceleration Programm des AIL haben sich bislang insgesamt 650 Start-ups aus rund 70 Ländern weltweit beworben. Zehn Jungunternehmen haben das Programm erfolgreich absolviert. Für zwei Start-ups mündete ihre Programmbeteiligung in einem Investment bzw. einer Kooperation mit der BayWa und RWA. In Kürze startet das dritte AIL Acceleration Programm. „Unser Ziel ist, die Zukunft der Landwirtschaft aktiv mitzugestalten und unseren Kunden Innovationen nutzbar zu machen“, sagt Klaus Josef Lutz, Vorstandsvorsitzender der BayWa AG. „Das erreichen wir über die Förderung von Startups aus aller Welt, die sich mit neuen Technologien und Strategien speziell für den Agrarbereich auseinandersetzen.“ Reinhard Bauer, Geschäftsführer des AIL, nahm den Preis stellvertretend für sein junges elf-köpfiges Team entgegen. „In den vergangenen Jahren haben wir viel Energie in die Suche nach bahnbrechenden Ideen und herausragenden Start-ups investiert. Ich bin stolz auf das Erreichte und freue mich sehr, dass unsere Initiative und Leistung sowohl auf internationaler Ebene als auch in unseren Heimatmärkten wahrgenommen wird.“ Der Global Innovator Award wurde in diesem Jahr erstmals verliehen. Die Auszeichnung fand im Rahmen des Exporttages der Außenwirtschaft Austria, der größten ExportInformationsveranstaltung Österreichs, statt.

Erste Erfolge und eine hohe Kundennachfrage erlauben einen positiven Ausblick auf die baldige Kommerzialisierung der Dienstleistung für unsere Kunden. Als Teilnehmer am Acceleration Programm des Agro Innovation Lab im Jahr 2018 konnte Vitirover in Zusammenarbeit mit den Fachexperten der RWA viele wichtige Meilensteine in der Kommerzialisierung erreichen: mehrere vom AIL organisierte und betreute Pilotversuche in österreichischen Weingärten, unter anderem in Kooperation mit der Universität für Bodenkultur und der Weinbauschule Krems Erweiterung der Zielgruppe um Umspannwerke inklusive Pilotversuch mit zwei Vitirover-Mährobotern technische Einschulung eines RWA-Projektbetreuers in St. Emilion in Frankreich Erarbeitung des Geschäftsmodells „Roboter als Dienstleistung“ Weiterführende Informationen zu Vitirover selbst finden Sie hier Projekterkenntnisse Die Pilotversuche bestätigen eine hohe Kundennachfrage nach autonomem Grünflächenmanagement. Im Weingarten ist vor allem die genaue Unkrautbekämpfung nahe am Stock im Zwischenstockbereich sehr wichtig. Dafür ist Vitirover mit seinen an der Vorderfront montierten Messermotoren bestens geeignet. Die Energie bezieht Vitirover nicht aus einer Ladestation, sondern über ein integriertes Photovoltaik-Modul. Die Flächenleistung ist durch die Schattenflächen der Reben und durch den erhöhten Energiebedarf bei unebenem Untergrund schwankend. Diese kann durch Wechseln des integrierten Pufferakkus gesteigert werden. Bei den laufenden Pilotversuchen steht die Optimierung der Flächenleistung im Fokus. Im Umspannwerk steht vor allem die Sicherheit des Arbeitsvorgangs im Vordergrund. Hier kann durch eine geringere Anzahl an Hindernissen eine höhere Flächenleistung erzielt werden.

Ziel ist das Nutzbarmachen von neuen Entwicklungen und Trends für Landwirte. IoT & Digitalisierung: In der Landwirtschaft ergeben sich durch die Nutzung von Sensorik sowie die Digitalisierung von Prozessen enorme Potenziale bei der Effizienzsteigerung und bei fundierten Entscheidungsfindungen – egal ob für kleinere oder größere Höfe, oder auch für Lohnunternehmer. Dafür ist das AIL auf der Suche nach praxistauglichen Lösungen sowohl für Standorte, beispielsweise bei der Lagerung von landwirtschaftlichen Erzeugnissen, als auch für Landwirte, für die Arbeitsschritte automatisiert dokumentiert werden. Übermittelte Maschinendaten können für eine zeitgerechte Ersatzteillieferung sorgen. Nachhaltigkeit: Die Landwirtschaft leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Klimaschutz, der verstärkt in den Vordergrund gerückt werden soll, aber auch weiter ausgebaut werden muss, um dem Klimawandel entgegenzuwirken. Gerade in der diesjährig vorgestellten Farm-to-Fork-Strategie der Europäischen Union kommt klar heraus, dass die nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung in der Landwirtschaft ein Fokusthema der Zukunft ist. Die Land- und Forstwirtschaft hat als einzige Branche die Möglichkeit, CO2 aktiv zu binden und das in Form von Humusaufbau in den Böden. Dafür haben wir in diesem Jahr unser neues Lagerhaus-Programm „Zukunft Erde“ gestartet, bei dem Landwirte für ihre Maßnahmen rund um nachhaltigen Humusaufbau belohnt werden. Die Weiterentwicklung dieses Programms, aber auch die Evaluierung von Möglichkeiten zur Methan-Reduktion oder auch anderen Klimaschutz-Aspekten der Landwirtschaft, werden folgen. Automatisierung: Das Thema Automatisierung steht seit einiger Zeit beim Agro Innovation Lab im Fokus. Die Robotik-Challenge im vergangenen Jahr konnte die Potenziale deutlich aufzeigen. Nun gilt es die geeigneten Geräte in die Praxis zu bringen. In den vergangenen Monaten konnten einige Robotik-Entwickler mit Neuentwicklungen Interesse wecken, die zuletzt auch bei der jährlichen Robotik-Messe „FIRA“ in Frankreich Anfang Dezember präsentiert wurden. Das Ziel beim Thema Automatisierung ist es, die Vorreiterrolle des Agro Innovation Labs als Robotik-Kompetenzpartner weiter auszubauen und im Rahmen von Praxiseinsätzen gemeinsam mit interessierten Landwirten die besten Geräte zu identifizieren. In Zusammenarbeit mit unterschiedlichen Partnern, insbesondere Landwirten, möchten wir die Trends der Landwirtschaft aufgreifen und Innovationen nutzbar machen. Wir freuen uns jederzeit über Anregungen und Ideen. Foto (c) Robert Gebauer, AIL ","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ZE_web_RG-6-kleiner-e1616762139130.jpg","21.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/die-roboter-erobern-die-landwirtschaft/","AgroInnovationLab","Die Roboter erobern die Landwirtschaft","Pferde, die Pflugkarren ziehen, sind in der Landwirtschaft schon längst Geschichte. Schon bald könnte dasselbe mit Traktoren passieren, die von Landwirten gelenkt werden. Auch in der Landwirtschaft sind Künstliche Intelligenz und Robotertechnologie angekommen. Roboter, die aussäen, düngen, Unkraut bekämpfen und schließlich ernten, könnten schon bald auf heimischen Feldern unterwegs sein. Derzeit testet die Raiffeisen Ware Austria (RWA) zehn solarbetriebene, autonome Mähroboter, die untereinander kommunizieren und die Wege abstimmen können. „Wir setzen sie in Weingärten ein, dort, wo bei der bisherigen Unkrautbekämpfung Weinstöcke verletzt wurden oder Herbizide verwendet werden“, erklärt Christoph Metzker von der RWA. Bereits 2021 sollen sie flächendeckend zum Einsatz kommen. Die RWA sieht die Zukunft auch in der Landwirtschaft in Robotik-Lösungen. Um den Markt zu sondieren, wurde die „Robotics Challenge 2019“ vom Agro Innovation Lab (AIL) ins Leben gerufen. Insgesamt wurden 127 Unternehmen weltweit gefunden, die an Robotern für den Ernteeinsatz, die Unkrautbekämpfung und für verwandte Themen arbeiten. Sechs Unternehmen wurden als finale Teilnehmer ausgewählt, während der Sommermonate geht es mit den Roboter-Prototypen aufs Feld. Spargel und Erdbeeren Einer davon kann Spargel ernten – das Problem Erntehelfer im Marchfeld zu finden, würde gelöst, außerdem kann der Roboter identifizieren, welcher Spargel erntereif ist und welcher noch im Boden bleibt. Ein anderer soll den Erdbeeranbau und die -ernte erleichtern: Durch UV-Behandlung wird Mehltau (die größte Herausforderung im Anbau) reduziert, auch an einem Erntehelfer wird gearbeitet. Zudem gibt es Roboter, die für die Unkrautregulierung und den Pflanzenschutz eingesetzt werden, sie können erkrankte oder unerwünschte Pflanzen mit Hilfe von umfangreichen Datenbanken identifizieren und zielgerichtet mit Pflanzenschutzmitteln behandeln. „So kann der Einsatz von Herbiziden verringert und auf das Glyphosatverbot reagiert werden“, betont AIL-Geschäftsführer David Saad. Saad und Metzker sind sich einig, dass sich die Roboter-Technologie gerade in diesem Bereich in den nächsten zehn Jahren durchsetzen wird. „Der Trend geht zur Bio-Landwirtschaft, immer mehr Betriebe stellen um. Da ist die Entwicklung der Robotertechnologie besonders spannend“, sagt Saad. Die Prototypen, die im Rahmen der Robotics Challenge getestet werden, kosten von 100.000 Euro an aufwärts. Die RWA denkt an ein Genossenschaftsmodell: „Wir wollen die Technik für die Landwirte zugänglich machen, da können wir uns bei größeren Geräten Mietmodelle vorstellen“, so Metzker. Gesetzlicher Rahmen Derzeit gibt es aber abseits der Finanzierung noch eine andere Schwierigkeit: Die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen sind nicht gegeben. „Es gibt noch keine Regulatorien. Bevor man die Technik zur Serienreife bringt, muss die Gesetzgebung festlegen, was erlaubt ist und was nicht“, sagt Saad. Dabei geht es zum Beispiel darum, wie groß die Geräte sein dürfen, die ohne das Beisein von Menschen unterwegs sind oder welche Sicherheitskriterien beim Einsatz von Robotern eingehalten werden müssen. Außerdem interessant: Alle vorgestellten Prototypen des Wettbewerbs besitzen Verbrennungsmotoren. „Bei Elektroantrieben wären die Kosten für die Batterien enorm hoch. Außerdem glauben wir, dass Landwirte sich eher einen Roboter zulegen, bei dem sie im Notfall selbst kleine Reparaturen durchführen können“, erläutert David Saad. Die beiden Experten sagen zudem, dass die Landwirte sehr aufgeschlossen gegenüber den neuen technischen Möglichkeiten seien, die durch Künstliche Intelligenz geboten werden.

Die sechs Gewinner-Start-ups der diesjährigen Bewerbungsrunde präsentierten vor rund 300 Gästen ihre Fortschritte bei der Weiterentwicklung ihrer Geschäftsideen hin zur Marktreife. Das AIL ist die gemeinsame Innovationsplattform von BayWa AG und RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG mit dem Ziel, Innovationen im Agrarbereich zu entdecken und aktiv weiter mit zu gestalten. 265 Start-ups aus 61 Ländern hatten sich um eine Teilnahme am Acceleration Programm 2017 beworben. „Gemeinsam mit den Start-ups haben wir die innovativen Ansätze weiterverfolgt, um diese in Zukunft für die Landwirtschaft und damit unsere Kunden nachhaltig nutzbar zu machen“, sagt Klaus-Josef Lutz, Vorstandsvorsitzender der BayWa AG. Unter anderem wurden Pilotversuche gestartet, Produkte zur Serienreife gebracht, Businesspläne entwickelt, detaillierte Marktanalysen erstellt oder Kooperationsvereinbarungen mit strategischen Partnern getroffen. „In zwei von sechs Fällen konnten wir bereits am Markt aktiv werden“, so Lutz. FarmHedge aus Irland zum Beispiel, eine Online-Plattform zur Bildung von Ein- und Verkaufsgemeinschaften, soll voraussichtlich noch im Laufe dieses Jahres österreichischen Landwirten zur Verfügung stehen. An der web-basierten Plattform für den Vertrieb langsam drehender Ersatzteile BartParts, Niederlande, haben namhafte Händler bereits Interesse gezeigt und über diese in Deutschland und Österreich schon Teile verkauft. Mit Agra2b aus Deutschland, das an einem Online-Marktplatz für Landwirte arbeitet, hat das AIL gemeinsam großflächige Tests vorbereitet und relevante Zielgebiete in Deutschland identifiziert. Drone Clouds aus Südafrika setzt Drohnen- und Satellitendaten in der Landwirtschaft ein, um mögliche Bedrohungen durch Schädlinge, Pflanzenkrankheiten oder Versorgungsdefizite frühzeitig und auf der Teilfläche zu erkennen. Ergebnis aus der Zusammenarbeit mit dem AIL sind Kooperationen in Südafrika und Deutschland. Bei der Mehlwurmzucht, der sich die chinesisch-österreichische Kooperation LivinFarms widmet, wurden eine erste Pilotanlage konzipiert und interessierte Landwirte für diese Anlage gefunden. Durch den Rückgang an verfügbarer Ackerfläche konkurrieren Lebensmittel- und Futtermittelproduktion miteinander. Insekten, so der Ansatz, könnten eine Alternative zu gegenwärtig angebauten proteinreichen Futterpflanzen sein. Auch bei Livestock Technologies aus Südkorea wurden wichtige Weichen gestellt: Das Start-up kann mittels Sensortechnik im Kuhpansen den Abkalbungszeitpunkt mittlerweile akkurat vorhersagen und zutreffende Aussagen zum Gesundheitszustand einzelner Tiere liefern. Der nächste Schritt werden Gespräche hinsichtlich möglicher Kooperationspartnerschaften und Finanzierungsmöglichkeiten sein, um auch zukünftig mit den Start-ups verbunden zu bleiben. Im März startet die Bewerbungsrunde für das Acceleration Programm 2018. Seit 2016 ruft das Agro Innovation Lab weltweit dazu auf, dass sich Start-ups aus dem Agrarbereich mit ihrer Geschäftsidee für eine Teilnahme bewerben.

Die Kontakte zu eFriends wurden bereits Ende 2019 geknüpft – über das AIL. eFriends bietet eine innovative Plattformtechnologie, die es Nutzern ermöglicht, selbst produzierten Solarstrom mit anderen Nutzern in Echtzeit zu teilen. Dies funktioniert über eine neuartige Technologie, die ganz einfach im Verteilerkasten installiert werden kann. Die RWA setzt mit der Beteiligung gerade in der aktuell herausfordernden Situation ein klares Zeichen der Förderung von Innovation und nachhaltigen Ansätzen über Start-up-Kooperationen. Die aktuelle Partnerschaft verfolgt das Ziel, gemeinsam Solarstrom und andere erneuerbare Energieformen zu forcieren sowie die Vernetzung von regionalen Produzenten voranzutreiben. Vor mehreren Jahren hatte eFriends-Gründer und CEO Matthias Katt die Idee, eine Technologie zu entwickeln, die es jeder und jedem ermöglicht, heimisch produzierten Sonnenstrom in Echtzeit und unabhängig vom Standort mit anderen zu teilen. Aus ersten Ansätzen und Ideen entwickelte sich im Jahr 2018 schließlich die eFriends Energy GmbH als Ökostromanbieter. Die eFriends zählen heute zur größten Energiegemeinschaft Österreichs, der mittlerweile 500 Haushalte angehören. Nun, zwei Jahre später, beteiligt sich die RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria über ihre Corporate Venture Capital Gesellschaft, die RWA Invest GmbH, mit rund 24 Prozent an der eFriends Energy GmbH. Die RWA selbst ist gemeinsam mit verschiedenen Beteiligungsunternehmen ein wichtiger Energie- und Stromversorger, vor allem in den ländlichen Regionen Österreichs, und seit Anfang des Jahres über ihre Tochter RWA Solar Solutions auch in der Errichtung von Photovoltaik-Großanlagen tätig. Es freut uns, dass wir immer wieder interessante Start-ups in den verschiedensten Unternehmensbereichen auf dem Markt aufspüren und im Konzern erfolgreich für die Konsumenten anbieten können.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/einzigartiges-vehikel/","AgroInnovationLab","„Einzigartiges Vehikel“","Von der solarbetriebenen Mähroboter-Flotte bis zum 3D-Silo-Sensor – das Agro Innovation Lab präsentierte beim Demo Day die Erfolge seines dritten Acceleration Programms. Wir haben die ganze Welt in der Tasche, am Handgelenk oder als intelligenten Assistenten am Küchentisch. So kompliziert die smarten Geräte oft sind, vereinfachen sie doch vieles. Neue Technologien verändern aber nicht nur das Leben des Einzelnen, sondern wirken in jeder erdenklichen Branche. Das Entwicklungstempo ist rasant, wer nicht Schritt hält, fällt zurück. Agilität gilt als Gebot der Stunde – ist aber leichter gesagt als getan. Vor allem traditionsreiche Organisationen wie die Raiffeisen Ware Austria (RWA) oder ihr strategischer Partner, die Baywa, können aufgrund ihrer Größe und der genossenschaftlichen Basis oft nicht so schnell agieren, wie es vielleicht nötig wäre. Andererseits sind sie breiter aufgestellt und damit krisenresistenter – wegweisende Entscheidungen werden nachhaltig und demokratisch getroffen. Eine dieser Entscheidungen war 2016 die Gründung des Agro Innovation Lab (AIL), mit dem Auftrag, Innovationen im landwirtschaftlichen Bereich aufzuspüren, ihre Relevanz zu testen und sie letztendlich für den Markt zugänglich zu machen. „Unser Job ist es, die Innovations-Pipeline für die BayWa und RWA zu sichern“, formuliert es David Saad, der seit September 2018 die Geschäfte des AIL führt. Um diesen Auftrag zu erfüllen, wurde ein Acceleration Programm für Start-ups aus dem Agrarbereich ins Leben gerufen. RWA und Baywa profitieren dabei von den frischen Ideen – die jungen Unternehmen von den Ressourcen, dem Netzwerk und Know-how der beiden Branchengrößen. „Es gibt keine andere Industrie, die mehr Innovation und Technologie verwendet als die Landwirtschaft. Der Austausch mit jungenengagierten Menschen aus der ganzen Welt ist unglaublich wichtig für traditionsreiche Unternehmen wie die RWA oder die Baywa. Wir müssen neue Denkweisen ins Unternehmen bringen“, bekräftigt RWA-Generaldirektor Reinhard Wolf. Seit der Gründung 2016 haben sich bisher mehr als650 Start-ups aus rund 70 Ländern für die Teilnahme am Programm beworben. Zehn Jungunternehmen haben das Programm erfolgreich absolviert. Für zwei Start-ups aus dem ersten Durchlauf mündete die Teilnahmein einer Beteiligung durch Baywa und RWA.Aus dem Programm 2017 gingen ebenso drei Kooperationen hervor. So ist zum Beispiel „FarmHedge“ – eine Online-Plattform für bedarfsgerechte und personalisierte Angebote – schon in drei niederösterreichischen Lagerhaus-Genossenschaften im Einsatz. Die Vertriebsplattform für schwer absetzbare Ersatzteile „BartsParts“ wird bereits von elf Lagerhaus-Lagern benutzt. Mit „FarmPin“, einem Unternehmen, das Drohnen- und Satellitendaten in der Landwirtschaft einsetzt, stehen RWA und Baywa in enger Kollaboration– hier gibt es gemeinsame Verkaufsaktivitäten in Ungarn und in Südafrika. Aufgrund der klein strukturierten Landwirtschaft würde eine Nutzung des Dienst es in Österreich allerdings keinen Sinn machen, erklärt David Saad. Roboter, Pferd und Stroh Für den dritten Durchgang haben sich 2018 insgesamt252 Start-ups aus 53 Ländern beworben. Nach einemmehrstufigen Auswahlprozess schafften es sechs Startups ins Acceleration Programm. Über fünf Monatebot man den Teilnehmern Zugang zu Know-how, Netzwerk und Kunden der beiden Konzerne und unterstützte sie bei wichtigen Schritten in Richtung Marktreife. Am „Demo Day“ wurden nun die gemeinsamen Fortschritte vor rund 180 Gästen präsentiert. „Ich bin unsagbar stolz auf das Agro Innovation Lab als in Europa einzigartiges Vehikel zur Förderung von bahnbrechenden und richtungsweisenden Innovationen entlang der gesamten landwirtschaftlichen Wertschöpfungskette. Wir fördern heuer bereits zum dritten Mal erfolgreich Start-ups aus aller Welt und unterstützen diese dabei, ihre zündenden Ideen derbreiten Landwirtschaft zugänglich zu machen. Eine Win-win-Situation für den Fortschritt, die Start-ups und die Landwirte, in deren Auftrag wir arbeiten“, freut sich Reinhard Wolf. Das Spektrum der sechs Start-ups war auch im dritten Durchgang wieder breit gefächert. „Crop Intellect“ aus Großbritannien entwickelt innovative Flüssig-Blattdünger zur Effizienzsteigerung der Pflanze. Darunter fällt zum Beispiel ein Spray, der den Stickstoff-Ausstoß reduziert. Die vergangenen Monatewurden genutzt, um den Markteintritt in Österreich und CEE vorzubereiten, Kooperationen anzubahnen und für 2019 abschließende Produkttests im deutschsprachigen Raum zu lancieren. „Insylo“ aus Spanien bietet einen kostengünstigen Sensor, der in Futtersilos den Füllstand misst und Nachbestellungen automatisch auslösen kann. Um das Produkt für Betriebe oder Landwirte nutzbar zumachen, wurde über die Wintermonate ein Pilot mit Landwirten durchgeführt und eine detaillierte Marktanalyse sowie ein darauf basierendes Business Modell erarbeitet. Auf der Online-Plattform von „Biorfarm“ aus Italien können Obstbäume adoptiert und dadurch Produktionsprozesse nachverfolgt werden. Gemeinsam mit dem AIL wurde die Plattform an den österreichischen Markt angepasst. Österreichische Landwirte wurden bereits als erste Lieferanten gewonnen und der Markteintritt in der Pilotregion Wien durchgeführt.„Cabasus“ aus Deutschland hat den ersten sensorbasierten Tracker für Pferde entwickelt, mit dem die Aktivität sowie Gesundheit der Tiere permanent überwacht und via App am Handy abgebildet werden. Im Rahmen des Acceleration Programms wurde an einemgemeinsamen Geschäftsmodell für den österreichischen und deutschen Markt gearbeitet sowie die Erweiterung der App um eine Fütterungsempfehlung initiiert und gestartet.„Vitirover“ aus Frankreich bietet als Dienstleistungsservicesolarbetriebene und miteinander vernetzte Rasenmähroboter-Flotten zur biologischen und chemiefreien Pflege landwirtschaftlicher Flächen an. Als Einsatzgebiete für die Roboter eigenen sich vor allem Wein- und Obstgärten, Solarparks oder Bahntrassen.Im Zuge des Programms wurden mit dem AIL erste Schritte zum Markteintritt in Österreich und Deutschland vorbereitet.„Landpack“ aus Deutschland überzeugte das AIL mit Lebensmittel-Verpackungen aus Strohfasern als eine umweltfreundliche und vor allem günstigere Alternative zu Styropor. Um das Produkt herstellen zu können, musste das Unternehmen erst selbst die entsprechende Anlage entwerfen und bauen. Gemeinsam mit dem AIL wurden Szenarien für eine nachhaltige Erweiterung der Produktionskapazitäten auch in Österreicherarbeitet. Weiters wurde die Anwendbarkeit der Technologie in anderen Bereichen geprüft sowie ein Pilotversuch für ein Heimtierprodukt gestartet. Mehr Fokus „Ich freue mich, dass wir erneut brillante Ideen innovativer Start-ups vor den Vorhang geholt haben. Dabei sind wir 2018 vor allem in Europa fündig geworden. Dies zeigt, dass auf unserem Kontinent ein großes Potenzial besteht, mit dem wir die Zukunft der Landwirtschaft gestalten und für die österreichische Landwirtschaft nutzbar machen können“, betont David Saad.2019 plant das Agro Innovation Lab seine Aktivitäten auszubauen, wie der Geschäftsführer verrät: „Bisher haben wir jährliche Acceleration Programmedurchgeführt, die mehr oder weniger das gesamte landwirtschaftliche Spektrum bedient haben. Heuerhaben wir uns das Ziel gesetzt, einerseits die Anzahl der Initiativen zu erhöhen, und andererseits auch neue Formate zu entwickeln.“ Dabei soll sich vermehrt auf inhaltliche Themenschwerpunkte konzentriert werden, die in den nächsten Jahren für die heimischen Landwirte besonders relevant sein werden.

Die Finanzierung ermöglicht die Umsetzung der ambitionierten Wachstumspläne für den weiteren Auf- und Ausbau des Produktions- und Entwicklungsstandort für Biostimulantien und Biopestizide in Wien Liesing. Das 2016 aus dem Institut für Verfahrenstechnik der Technischen Universität Wien gegründete Spin-off beschäftigt 18 Mitarbeiter am Standort Wien. Unternehmensziel ist es, den Einsatz chemisch-synthetischer Produkte in der Landwirtschaft zu reduzieren und durch biologische Produkte zu ersetzen. „Wir haben schon früh das Potential des neuartigen Ansatzes von Evologic erkannt und freuen uns, dass dies in den letzten Jahren auch realisiert werden konnte“, erklärt Armin Sterlé, Leiter der RWA Invest. „Mit den zusätzlichen Finanzmitteln ist Evologic in der Lage, industriell relevante Produktionsvolumina zu erreichen. Das Unternehmen kann so In-House-Produkte, aber auch Auftragsproduktion für Großkunden anbieten“, so Sterlé. BartsParts Im Jahr 2017 war das holländische Unternehmen BartsParts Teilnehmer an unserem Acceleration Programm. BartsParts ist ein Webshop für langsam drehende Ersatzteile im Bereich Land- und Gartentechnik. Die Plattform vereint dabei dezentral gelagerte Ersatzteile zu einem vernetzten, digitalen Ersatzteillager und vermittelt diese an Käufer auf der ganzen Welt. Lokale Ersatzteilläger können somit ihren Altbestand verwerten; Kunden können aus einem großen Angebot Ersatzteile mit hohem Rabatt erwerben. Auch hier gibt es umfassende Änderungen: Mit Michiel Nijhuis konnte ein neuer CEO ins Boot geholt werden. Ebenso konnte auch hier eine neue Finanzierungsrunde mit dem Neuinvestor Raiffeisen Waren Zentrale Rhein-Main sowie den bestehenden Alt-Investoren – darunter auch die RWA – abgeschlossen werden. Insgesamt konnte so ein Finanzierungsvolumen von 800.000 Euro erreicht werden. Ein großartiger Schritt für den weiteren Ausbau der Tätigkeiten von BartsParts. Wir freuen uns über die positive Entwicklung der beiden Unternehmen und den gemeinsamen Weg.","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Evologic-BartsParts-e1616757780211.jpg","8.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/farmhedge-update/","AgroInnovationLab","FarmHedge – Update","FarmHedge, die Vertriebs-App der Landwirte und Lagerhäuser, konnte den Marktanteil in Österreich 2020 ausbauen und daneben auch international reüssieren. 2017 begann die erfolgreiche Zusammenarbeit von FarmHedge mit dem Agro Innovation Lab, der RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG sowie den Lagerhäusern. Waren zu Beginn drei Test-Lagerhaus-Genossenschaften im Projekt, so konnte heuer der Anteil auf 27 teilnehmende Lagerhaus-Genossenschaften ausgeweitet werden. Mit der App können die Lagerhäuser an rund 3.000 Landwirte als Kunden einerseits „Spot-Angebote“ verschicken, die der Landwirt wiederum – verbunden mit seinem Lagerhaus-Konto – direkt über die App bestellen kann. Außerdem können Landwirte ihre Erzeugnisse direkt auf der App den Lagerhäusern anbieten und Verkäufe abwickeln. So konnte heuer bereits die Umsatz-Marke von 3 Mio. EUR geknackt werden. Auch wenn landwirtschaftliche SpotAngebote und Erzeugnis-Ankäufe nach wie vor der Kern des FarmHedge-Angebots sind, hat sich die Plattform in den vergangenen zwei Jahren deutlich weiterentwickelt. Auch außerhalb von Österreich bietet FarmHedge inzwischen erste digitale Lösungen für landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen an. So startete im Herbst 2020 die erste Version einer Peer-to-Peer-Handelsplattform vorerst für Saatgut zwischen RWA-Tochterunternehmen in acht zentral- und osteuropäischen Ländern. Im heimischen irischen und britischen Markt entwickelt FarmHedge derzeit vor allem maßgeschneiderte Lösungen für den Futtermittelhandel zwischen Erzeugern und Endkunden. Für das Jahr 2021 strebt FarmHedge, neben dem Ausbau seiner Tätigkeiten in Irland, Großbritannien und Osteuropa, vor allem den Markteintritt in Deutschland an. Die RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG ist an FarmHedge mit 22% beteiligt. ","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FarmHedge_Logo_Black-e1608556068333.png","16.

Bei agronomischen Daten handelt es sich um Daten in der Landwirtschaft mit denen Erkenntnisse schneller und objektiver als mit herkömmlichen Methoden gewonnen werden können. Der Fokus lag dabei auf digitalen Bildern, die durch Trägersysteme wie Satelliten, Drohnen oder Maschinen generiert werden. Wie können Landwirte bei der Nutzung solcher agronomischer Daten unterstützt werden? Diese Frage wurde im Rahmen einer Podiumsdiskussion behandelt – mit der Erkenntnis, dass nicht die Generierung oder Übertragung dieser Daten kritisch ist, sondern vielmehr deren Interpretation, zum Beispiel Satellitenbilder. Wichtig für die Zukunft ist aus diesem Grund, die Prozesse so zu automatisieren, dass der Landwirt gar nicht bemerkt, dass Satellitendaten im Spiel sind, sondern dass diese Daten automatisch interpretiert und darauf basierend Handlungsempfehlungen gegeben werden. Da es sich bei Satellitendaten jedoch nur um oberflächliche Aufnahmen handelt, die nicht immer zuverlässig sein müssen, sollten die Handlungsempfehlungen mit einer Güteklasse gekennzeichnet werden. Dies wurde auch aus der Perspektive eines Landwirts bestätigt. Angebote an Landwirte werden sich zukünftig zunehmend von Produkten zu Dienstleistungen entwickeln, auch im Bereich von agronomischen Daten. Eine ideale Zukunftsperspektive geht also dahin, dass Landwirte auf Basis von Sensordaten gezieltere Entscheidungen für das Feldmanagement treffen können sowie Vorgänge wie Düngung und Pflanzenschutz automatisieren und dokumentieren. Diese spannenden Einblicke zu „Agronomic Data“ lassen uns hoffen, dass sich in Zukunft weitere zahlreiche StartUps mit der Interpretation von Satellitendaten beschäftigen werden. Wir bleiben dran und screenen den Markt laufend nach Lösungen, die für die RWA und den Lagerhaus Verbund spannend sein können.","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/csm_Logo_A_FAF_big_6759b1b9dd.png","19.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/intelligente-landwirtschaft-durch-das-internet-der-dinge/","AgroInnovationLab","Intelligente Landwirtschaft durch das Internet der Dinge","Ob es uns bewusst ist oder nicht, das sogenannte „Internet der Dinge“ (IoT) hat längst Einzug in unseren Alltag gehalten: seien es Fahrzeuge, Maschinen, Haushaltsgeräte oder Gebäude-Sensoren. All diese Geräte können sich mit dem Internet verbinden und ermöglichen eine Kommunikation zwischen Personen, Prozessen und Dingen. Diese Technologie macht sich auch die Landwirtschaft für eine effizientere Produktion zunutze. Was ist IoT? Der Begriff „Internet of Things“ (Internet der Dinge, IoT) wurde erstmals im Jahr 1999 vom britischen Technologie-Pionier Kevin Ashton eingeführt. Er beschreibt ein Netzwerk, das die Verknüpfung von eindeutig identifizierbaren Objekten (Things) über das Internet ermöglicht. Es wird also eine Vernetzung zwischen realen Objekten über das Internet hergestellt, um Informationen auszutauschen. Dieser Informationsaustausch kann mit dem Menschen sowie auch von Maschine zu Maschine (M2M) erfolgen. Durch die Vernetzung können die Geräte Daten senden, empfangen und oft auch selbständig handeln. Technologie Jedes intelligente Objekt im Internet der Dinge ist über eine eindeutige Internetadresse identifizierbar. Die Anbindung an das Internet kann kabelgebunden oder drahtlos erfolgen. Die drahtlose Vernetzung bringt viele Vorteile und kann in Weitverkehrsnetze und Nahbereichsnetze unterteilt werden. Übertragungstechnologien für Nahbereichsnetze sind unter anderem WLAN, Bluetooth oder Zigbee. Sie funktionieren auf kurze Distanzen mit hohen Datenraten und werden überwiegend in der Hausautomatisierung und für verschiedene medizinische Anwendungen eingesetzt. Die Konnektivität für Weitverkehrsnetze (Wide Area Network, WAN) erfolgt meist durch Mobilfunkunternehmen und wird mittels GSM, GPRS, UMTS und LTE bewerkstelligt. Diese Übertragungsarten werden verwendet, wenn entweder viele Daten gesendet oder empfangen werden müssen oder der Energieverbrauch keine große Rolle spielt. Oft ist es aber so, dass dort, wo die Daten erfasst werden, keine Infrastruktur vorhanden ist, um die Geräte mit Energie zu versorgen und diese sodann mit Akkus betrieben werden müssen. In diesen Fällen werden Weitverkehrsnetze (Low Power Wide Area Network, LPWAN) zur Anwendung gebracht. Solche Übertragungen können einerseits von Mobilfunkunternehmen mittels Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) oder über Sigfox beziehungsweise LoRaWAN hergestellt werden. Sigfox ist ein französisches Telekommunikationsunternehmen, das ein eigenes globales Funknetz aufbaut, um Objekte mit geringem Energiebedarf drahtlos mit dem Internet zu verbinden. Ähnlich ist das auch bei LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). LoRaWAN ist ein Niedrigenergie-Netzwerkprotokoll, das es einem erlaubt, Netze selbst aufzubauen. Diese Technologien wurden entwickelt, um das Optimum aus Energieeffizienz (lange Lebensdauer, ohne Akku zu tauschen), Datenrate (wie viele Informationen benötigt werden) und Reichweite (tiefe Gebäudedurchdringung) herauszuholen. So können Sensoren bis zu 10 Jahre im Einsatz sein, ohne den Akku tauschen zu müssen. Anwendungen des Internets der Dinge Im privaten Bereich sind IoT-Geräte als Fitnessarmbänder, die den Puls messen und die Anzahl der Schritte zählen, als Haustier-Tracker, die eine Echtzeit-Verfolgung von Hunden oder Katzen ermöglichen, oder als „Smart Home“-Anwendung stark im Wachsen begriffen. Im unternehmerischen Bereich wird das IoT eingesetzt, um beispielsweise Produkte und andererseits Geschäftsprozesse zu vernetzen. So können IoT-Services und -Funktionen in Produkte integriert und Abläufe im Unternehmen mithilfe der gesammelten Daten effizient gestaltet werden. Unter dem Schlagwort „Industrie 4.0“ wird nichts weniger als die vierte industrielle Revolution ausgerufen, welche sich bereits in vollem Gange befindet. Das Ziel ist es, alle analogen Prozesse durch digitale zu ersetzen und eine selbstorganisierte Produktion zu schaffen, in der Maschinen, Anlagen, Produkte und Menschen miteinander kommunizieren und kooperieren. IoT in der Landwirtschaft Auch in der Landwirtschaft sind vielfältige Szenarien für den Einsatz von IoT-Sensoren denkbar. Seien es selbstfahrende Traktoren, vernetzte Erntemaschinen oder Systeme zur Überwachung von Wetter und Bewässerung. Die Automatisierung von Gewächshäusern und das Management von Nutztieren lassen sich ebenfalls mit dieser Technologie sehr gut umsetzen. Hinter dem Schlagwort „Precision Farming“ verbergen sich auch zahlreiche Verfahren, die auf der Verknüpfung von aggregierten Daten und deren Interpretation basieren. Als Beispiel dafür können die Wetterstationen der RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria herangezogen werden, welche erst durch Vernetzung untereinander ihr volles Potential entfalten. Durch die gute Konfigurierbarkeit lassen sich diese Stationen optimal auf die individuellen Bedürfnisse anpassen. Es wird beispielsweise berechnet, wie hoch das Risiko ist, dass sich eine bestimmte Pflanzenkrankheit im Feld etabliert. Diese Wahrscheinlichkeiten werden für über 80 Pflanzenkrankheiten und mehr als 40 Nutzpflanzen errechnet und bieten die Entscheidungsgrundlage für den bedarfsgerechten Pflanzenschutz. Aufgrund der klimatischen Veränderungen wird es in Zukunft immer wichtiger, mit der Ressource Wasser schonend umzugehen. Auch hier können die Daten von IoT-Sensoren, wenn sie mit Wetterprognosen kombiniert werden, wertvolle Erkenntnisse bringen. Doch nicht nur am Feld, sondern auch auf Weiden und in Ställen halten die neuen Sensoren Einzug. Um dem Wohlergehen von Tieren gerecht zu werden, ist es entscheidend, dass Tierproduzenten ihre derzeitigen Praktiken verbessern. Das frühzeitige Erkennen von klimabezogenen Stressfaktoren ist für die Züchter von entscheidender Bedeutung, um rasch schon bei geringsten Verhaltensänderungen reagieren zu können und damit Beeinträchtigungen der Tiere zu vermeiden. Ein weiteres Beispiel für die Nutzung von IoT – und bereits im Einsatz bei der RWA-Tochterfirma Wärme Austria – ist OilFox. Olifox ist ein innovativer Ultraschall-Füllstandmesser für den Heizöltank, der per WLAN oder NB-IoT an das Internet angebunden ist. Eine analoge Überwachung des Füllstandes ist somit nicht mehr nötig, da man bequem über die OilFox-App den aktuellen Wert kontrollieren kann. Lösungen wie diese werden maßgeblich dazu beitragen, die Landwirtschaft vernetzter, smarter und somit effizienter zu machen. Für die Herausforderungen der Zukunft ist man nicht zuletzt durch die Kooperation von RWA & Magenta gut gewappnet. So ist sichergestellt, dass ein flächendeckendes und zukunftssicheres Netz für die Nutzung von IoT-Geräten im Lagerhaus-Verbund zur Verfügung steht. Derzeit arbeiten wir intensiv daran, neue technologische Entwicklungen aufzugreifen und mögliche Anwendungsszenarien zu entwickeln. Aktuell laufende Projekte beschäftigen sich beispielsweise mit getrackten Transportboxen, Sensorik in Lagern oder der Erfassung von Daten in Silos und Flachlagern.","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IoT-cLouis-Reed-e1616762574251.jpg","28.

Steckbrief Lena Ranneberg, 26 Position: Innovationsmanagerin Kontakt: l.ranneberg@agroinnolab.com oder www.linkedin.com/in/lena-ranneberg Erster Arbeitstag: 12.10.2020 Diese Erfahrungen bringe ich mit… … bevor ich zum AIL gekommen bin, habe ich in Weihenstephan (D), Hohenheim (D) und Wageningen (NL) studiert. Landwirtschaftliche Praxiserfahrung durfte ich auf verschiedenen Betrieben in Deutschland, Österreich, Frankreich und in den Niederlanden sammeln. Neben der Arbeit auf klassischen Ackerbau- und Milchviehbetrieben habe ich auch spannende Einblicke in Aquaponik, Insektenfarming, Imkerei, Permakultur und den Anbau von Algen erhalten. In den vergangenen zwei Jahren habe ich neben dem Studium bei einer Unternehmensberatung Erfahrung in der Gründungsberatung und dem Marketing sammeln dürfen und war seit 2018 in der Projektleitung eines Start-up-Wettbewerbs aktiv. Das ist mir bei meiner Arbeit besonders wichtig… … mir liegt es am Herzen, praxistaugliche Innovationen umzusetzen, die die RWA-Fachabteilungen, die Lagerhäuser und vor allem die Landwirte dabei unterstützen, sich zukunftsfähig aufzustellen und ihre Betriebe erfolgreich zu führen. Neben den Lösungen, die bereits heute einen Mehrwert bieten, ist es mir außerdem wichtig, auch „Zukunftsmusik“ nicht außer Acht zu lassen, um hier frühzeitig Expertise aufzubauen. Diese Themen werde ich im AIL unterstützen… … in den kommenden Jahren werden vor allem Innovationen zu Digitalisierung, Automatisierung und Nachhaltigkeit im Vordergrund stehen. Ich beschäftige mich mit Robotik-Lösungen im Pflanzenbau sowie der Emissionsreduktion in der Landwirtschaft. Außerdem bin ich für die Organisation verschiedener Innovationsformate und -events für die Fachbereiche zuständig. Hier bin ich gerne jederzeit ansprechbar, wenn Ideen aufkommen und die passende Umsetzung ausgearbeitet werden soll. Das interessiert mich außerhalb meiner Arbeit… … am liebsten bin ich mit dem Rad, zu Fuß oder auf den Skiern in den Bergen unterwegs. Meinen Urlaub verbringe ich immer irgendwo auf der Welt mit dem Rucksack und genieße gern exotisches Essen. Da ich erst seit kurzem in Wien bin, freue ich mich darauf, die Stadt zu entdecken und bin hier natürlich immer offen für Tipps. Auf eine gute Zusammenarbeit!

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/neu-im-team-mariella-schultes/","AgroInnovationLab","Neu im Team: Mariella Schultes","Wie ist es, Innovationsmanager beim Agro Innovation Lab zu sein? Der Aufgabenbereich ist sehr vielfältig. Kein Tag gleicht dem anderen. Grundsätzlich nehmen wir als Innovationsmanager drei unterschiedliche Rollen ein: Wir sind agile ProjektmanagerInnen, NetzwerkerInnen und Start-up-ExpertInnen. Was bedeutet das? Als agile ProjektmanagerInnen sind wir parallel für mehrere Projekte des Agro Innovation Lab verantwortlich. Das können Einzelkooperationen mit Start-ups oder mit Tochterfirmen der RWA sein, aber auch Projekte im Rahmen unserer Formate, zum Beispiel Acceleration Programme oder Innovation Challenges. Außerdem ist es als Innovationsmanager sehr wichtig zu netzwerken, sowohl innerhalb der Organisation als auch außerhalb. Innerhalb der Organisation bekommt man auf diese Weise einen guten Überblick über die Trends in den einzelnen Geschäftsbereichen der RWA. Außerhalb der Organisation ist es für uns natürlich immer wichtig, interessante Start-ups kennenzulernen. Durch die vielen Anfragen und Projekte mit Start-ups sind wir außerdem Start-up-Experten, das heißt, wir beurteilen, mit welchen Start-ups eine Kooperation für beide Seiten sinnvoll ist. Da ich erst relativ kurz beim Agro Innovation Lab bin, habe ich aber noch nicht alle Aufgaben eines Innovationsmanagers erlebt. Hast du dir das so vorgestellt? Ja und nein. In der Ausschreibung und beim Bewerbungsgespräch wurden die drei Rollen eines Innovationsmanagers kommuniziert und ich habe mir schon erwartet, dass ich einen diversen Aufgabenbereich haben werde. Überraschend kam trotzdem der „Information Overload“, vor allem in den ersten Wochen beim Agro Innovation Lab. Neben den internen Prozessen und den Projekten, die ich von Anfang an übernehmen durfte, habe ich festgestellt, wie komplex die Landwirtschaftsbranche ist und wie viel ich da noch lernen kann. Mein Hintergrund ist das Innovationsmanagement und obwohl ich mich in Landwirtschaftsthemen eingelesen habe, werde ich in dem Bereich bestimmt noch sehr viel Wissen in den nächsten Jahren aufbauen. Was gefällt dir beim Agro Innovation Lab besonders gut? Dass ich von Anfang an in alle Bereiche eingebunden wurde und mir sofort Verantwortung übertragen wurde. Schon nach weniger als 2 Wochen habe ich eine Kunden-Präsentation erstellt und auch gehalten. Das war für mich zwar eine Herausforderung, aber die Lernkurve ist enorm. Und da es immer neue Projekte gibt, bin ich davon überzeugt, dass ich auch weiterhin viel beim Agro Innovation Lab lernen werde. Warum wolltest du beim Agro Innovation Lab arbeiten? Ich finde Innovation in der Landwirtschaft besonders spannend. In dem Bereich ändert sich – nicht nur wegen des Klimawandels, sondern auch wegen des zunehmenden Arbeitskräftemangels und bevorstehender Regulationen – so viel, dass Innovation enorm wichtig ist. Unter dem Aspekt fiel die Entscheidung auf das Agro Innovation Lab. Ich wollte an Lösungen für die Agrarbranche mitwirken. Ein weiterer wichtiger Grund war das Team. Bei der zweiten Runde des Bewerbungsgesprächs habe ich das komplette Team kennengelernt und ich hatte den Eindruck, dass ich mich sehr wohlfühlen werde. Dieser Eindruck hat sich bestätigt. Wie sieht ein typischer Tag als Innovationsmanager im Agro Innovation Lab aus? Typischerweise beginnt er zwischen 8 und 9 Uhr mit einem Kaffee oder einem Tee. Meistens beantworte ich zuerst meine E-Mails, gehe meine To-do-Liste und meinen Kalender durch, was im Verlauf der Woche ansteht. Dann arbeite ich an meinen Projekten, unterbrochen durch Telefonate und diverse Meetings mit Kunden, potenziellen Kooperationspartnern oder meinen Kollegen. Ich arbeite sehr eng mit meinem Kollegen Hannes, dem zweiten Innovationsmanager, zusammen. Wir beide tauschen uns sehr häufig aus und überlegen gemeinsam neue Konzepte für zukünftige Projekte im Agro Innovation Lab. Außerdem haben wir einmal pro Woche einen Jour fixe, bei dem das ganze Team – also David, Sebastian, Andrea, Hannes und ich – zusammenkommen, um unsere Projekte, Organisatorisches oder was sonst so ansteht zu besprechen. Gab es bereits Momente, in denen du aus deiner Komfortzone heraustreten musstest? Vor einigen Wochen bin ich zur Farm & Food Messe nach Berlin geflogen. Es ging darum, die aktuellen Trends in der Landwirtschaft aufzunehmen und als Innovationsplattform der RWA immer up to date zu bleiben. Natürlich ist bei so einem Event auch Networking sehr wichtig. Für mich war es ungewohnt, einfach auf fremde Leute zuzugehen. Da musste ich, vor allem zu Beginn, sicherlich aus meiner Komfortzone heraustreten. Ich habe aber sehr schnell gemerkt, dass alle nett und offen sind. Es hat dann wirklich Spaß gemacht, so viele spannende Leute aus dem Landwirtschaftsbereich kennenzulernen und ihnen über das Agro Innovation Lab zu erzählen.

Und auch die richtige Menge für den optimalen Ertrag. Genau das wird möglich durch den Einsatz von Smart Farming-Technologie für die ideal auf die Teilfläche angepasste Bewirtschaftung der Agrarflächen. Im Rahmen eines zweijährigen Projekts konnten wir dazu im Verbund von Lagerhäusern und RWA, gemeinsam mit neun teilnehmenden Projektlandwirten, Know-how und praktische Erfahrung im Bereich Aussaat und N-Düngung bei Körnermais aufbauen. Im Herbst 2017 wurde das „Pilotprojekt Teilfläche“ mit dem Schwerpunkt der teilflächenspezifischen Bewirtschaftung (Variable Rate) bei Körnermais gestartet. Als Grundlage für die Anpassung der Saatstärke und N-Düngermenge je Teilfläche wurde die TalkingFields-Basiskarte (TF-Basiskarte) verwendet. Diese zeigt beständige, relative Biomasseunterschiede auf Basis von mehrjährigen Satellitendaten und erlaubt Rückschlüsse auf die Verteilung der Ertragsfähigkeit und Bodenqualität auf dem Schlag. Anhand dieser Daten wurden Applikationskarten mit einer Auflösung von 10 x 10 m erstellt. Versuchsanordnung Neben der Variante 0 mit homogener Ausbringungsmenge wurden die Varianten A, D und AD angelegt: Variante A: Variation der Saatstärke Variante D: Variation der N-Düngermenge Variante AD: Variation der Saatstärke und N-Düngermenge Das Gesamtausmaß der Körnermais-Anbaufläche betrug ca. 100 ha je Versuchsjahr, verteilt auf etwa zehn Schläge. Dabei kam zum Großteil die Sorte DieSONJA zum Einsatz. Als N-Dünger wurde vorrangig der stabilisierte Dünger ALZON® neo-N eingesetzt. Technik für die Teilfläche Neben einem 6155R John Deere-Traktor kamen noch eine acht-reihige Monosem Einzelkornsämaschine sowie ein Rauch Axis Düngerstreuer zum Einsatz. Die eingesetzten Maschinen waren ISOBUS-fähig und hatten die für die teilflächenspezifische Bewirtschaftung notwendige Zertifizierung TC-GEO. Die technische Umsetzung der teilflächenspezifischen Bewirtschaftung im Rahmen des Projekts war sehr zufriedenstellend. Ein besonderes Augenmerk muss dabei vor allem auf die Kompatibilität der Softwarestände der einzelnen Geräte untereinander gelegt werden. Versuchsergebnisse Im Mittel über beide Jahre konnte bei der Variante A ein Mehrertrag von ca. 3,3 Prozent realisiert werden. Bei der Variante D hingegen lag der Mehrertrag nur bei ca. 1,7 Prozent. Die kombinierte Variante erreichte im Mittel Mehrerträge von 3,4 Prozent. Bei einzelnen Versuchsflächen sind auch Mehrerträge im Bereich von 5 bis 7 Prozent geerntet worden. Schlussfolgerungen Insbesondere die Variation der Saatstärke hat im Rahmen des Projekts zum Teil sehr gut auf den Ertrag reagiert. Die Variation der N-Düngermenge bei Körnermais hat auch im selben Jahr Effekte gezeigt, diese waren jedoch geringer als die Effekte der Variation der Aussaatstärke. Eine teilflächenspezifische Düngung sollte aber ohnehin über mehrere Jahre betrachtet und bestenfalls durch eine zonierte Bodenbeprobung gestützt werden. Die Grundlage für den Erfolg einer teilflächenspezifischen Bewirtschaftung liegt im systematischen Aufbau einer fundierten Datenbasis für die einzelnen Feldstücke des Betriebs. Auf Basis dieser Daten können Applikationskarten für verschiedene Anwendungen erstellt werden.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/rehkitzrettung/","AgroInnovationLab","Rehkitzrettung","Alljährlich sterben in Österreich tausende Rehkitze einen qualvollen Tod bei der Mahd. Mit modernen Technologien gestaltet sich die Suche nach den Jungtieren einfacher denn je. Eine Dohne, bestückt mit einer Wärmebildkamera, ist das ideale Werkzeug, um die kleinen Tiere im hohen Gras zu finden. Sowohl die Einsatzdauer der Suche als auch das dafür aufgewendete Personal können so drastisch reduziert werden. Wenn die kleinen, ca. 1.200 Gramm schweren Rehkitze auf die Welt kommen, haben sie die ersten drei Lebenswochen den sogenannten „Drückinstinkt“. Das Rehkitz presst sich flach auf den Boden, bewegt sich nicht und hofft, nicht entdeckt zu werden. Da die Kitze fast keinen Eigengeruch haben, werden sie kaum entdeckt und sind auch von Hunden nur schwer zu finden. Diese Strategie funktioniert ausgezeichnet gegen Fressfeinde wie Fuchs, Luchs oder Wildschwein. Sie erweist sich aber als tödlich, wenn die Mähmaschine anrückt. Deshalb suchen Jäger und Bauern vor der Mahd das Feld nach dort gesetzten Rehkitzen ab. Doch nicht nur für die gefährdeten Tiere ist das von Vorteil. Wenn ein Kadaver von Wiesentieren nach dem Mähen im Silo landet, bilden sich durch dessen Zersetzung in Heu und Grassilage Toxine, die für Rinder und andere Nutztiere tödlich sein können. Durch sogenannten Botulismus kann es dadurch zu Fehlgeburten bei Rindern kommen. Um die Suche einfacher und effizienter zu gestalten, werden immer häufiger Drohnen eingesetzt. Handelsübliche, sehr kleine und relativ kostengünstige Drohnen, meist Quadkopter, bestückt mit Wärmebildkameras, sind für dieses Vorhaben gut geeignet. Durch ihre Handlichkeit und einfache Bedienbarkeit sind sie ein idealer Begleiter für die Tierretter. Die Suche sollte noch vor Sonnenaufgang durchgeführt werden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt ist der Temperaturunterschied zwischen Rehkitz und Umgebung am größten und hilft damit der Wärmebildkamera beim Erkennen der Tiere. Später, wenn die Sonne bereits auf das Feld scheint, ist es nur mehr schwer möglich, erwärmte Objekte wie z.B. Steine oder Erdhügel von den Tieren zu unterscheiden. Die Drohne fliegt vorab geplante Wegpunkte ab. Dieser automatische Flugmodus ist wichtig, da bei einer manuellen Steuerung nicht sichergestellt ist, dass wirklich die gesamte Fläche überlappend abgeflogen wird. Um die Suche schnell abwickeln zu können, wird der Flächenplan vorab an den Drohnenpiloten übermittelt, damit dieser die Flugplanung erstellen kann. Zeit ist in diesem Zusammenhang kritisch, da in einer Region meist viele Landwirte zur selben Zeit mähen wollen und die Suche per Drohne nur bis Sonnenaufgang sinnvoll ist. Bei der Suche müssen mindestens zwei Personen anwesend sein. Einerseits ein Drohnenpilot oder eine Pilotin und andererseits ein Jäger oder Helfer, der das gefundene Kitz aus dem Feld bringt. Während das Feld mit dem Quadkopter beflogen wird, werden mögliche Fundstellen markiert. Anschließend werden diese Stellen mit der Drohne angeflogen. Der Helfer oder die Helferin haben ein Tablet bei sich, auf welchem er oder sie sich selbst und das Rehkitz als leuchtende Punkte sehen können. Nun kann das Rehkitz aus dem Feld gebracht werden. Bei einer kürzlich durchgeführten Rehkitzrettung mit der Jagdgesellschaft in Oberhautzental (NÖ) konnten sich zahlreiche Jäger mit der Technologie vertraut machen und die Rehkitzrettung per Drohne live miterleben. Ziel ist es, bis zur nächsten Saison, beginnend im Frühjahr 2021, das Service auszubauen und regional leichter verfügbar zu machen.

Gerade in Sonderkulturen ist die Unkrautregulierung zeit- und kostenintensiv. Öko-Landbau und Auflagen bei Pflanzenschutzmitteln erfordern zusätzlich effektive, alternative Lösungen. Im AIL wurde im Jahr 2019 mit der Robotics-Challenge der Grundstein gelegt, um die Landwirtschaft mit vollautonomen Systemen voranzubringen. Seit April besteht nun eine exklusive Händlervereinbarung mit dem Hackroboter-Hersteller Naio Technologies aus Frankreich. Das Unternehmen Naio Technologies hat seinen Firmensitz in Toulouse, Frankreich. Das Team mit hoher technischer Expertise besteht aus Ingenieuren in den Sparten Robotik, Mechanik und Agrarwissenschaft und nahm seine Vision im Jahr 2010 auf. Naio Technologies bringt somit fast zehn Jahre Erfahrung mit und ist weltweit Marktführer im Bereich landwirtschaftlicher Roboter. Im Frühjahr 2020 einigten sich Naio Technologies und die RWA auf eine exklusive Händlervereinbarung. Diese ermöglicht es, LandwirtInnen in Österreich über die RWA fit für eine automatisierte Zukunft zu machen. Das Portfolio von Naio Technologies umfasst derzeit drei verschiedene Maschinen. Der autonome Hackroboter Oz ermöglicht die Erledigung der Unkrautentfernung zwischen den Reihen bei einem Reihenabstand von mindestens 65 cm. Interessant ist Oz vor allem für den Einsatz in Baumschulen sowie für den Gemüse- und Gewürzanbau mit einer Arbeitsleistung von 1 ha pro Tag. Ab 2021 steht Oz für interessierte LandwirtInnen über RWA/AIL zur Miete oder zum Kauf zur Verfügung. Für Beetkulturen wie Salat, Lauch oder Zwiebeln hat Naio den Roboter Dino im Programm. Er eignet sich für Spurabstände von 160-210 cm mit einer Arbeitsleistung von bis zu 5 ha pro Tag. Dino erleichtert das Unkrauthacken zwischen den Reihen und erledigt für einzelne Kulturen auch das Hacken in der Reihe. Es lassen sich zahlreiche Werkzeuge am Fahrzeug anbauen. Im Jahr 2021 ermöglicht die RWA für interessierte LandwirtInnen den Besuch von Demonstrationen des Roboters Dino. Der dritte Roboter im Bunde ist der Weinbauroboter Ted, der für die mechanische Unkrautregulierung im Unterstockbereich, insbesondere auch zwischen den einzelnen Rebstöcken in der Reihe, eingesetzt werden kann. Mit seiner Außenbreite von 135 bis 180 cm können auch an Ted viele verschiedene Werkzeuge angebaut werden. Mit dem elektrischen Antrieb kann Ted bis zu 8 h am Stück arbeiten und so bis zu 40 ha bewirtschaften. Auch die Demonstration von Ted ist über die RWA möglich. Das AIL freut sich darauf, im Jahr 2021 Landwirte und Landwirtinnen vermehrt dabei zu unterstützen, sich mit Robotik und der Automatisierung arbeitsintensiver Tätigkeiten vertraut zu machen. Die dabei entstehende langfristige Unabhängigkeit von externer Arbeitskraft, die steigende Effizienz sowie Lösungen für den Öko-Landbau sind unter anderem wichtige Argumente für den Robotereinsatz in der Landwirtschaft. So wird österreichischen LandwirtInnen eine zukunftsfähige Perspektive geboten. Das AIL arbeitet derzeit in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Lagerhaus Technik Center an der Erstellung eines attraktiven Leistungsportfolios im Bereich Automatisierung.

Gemeinsam mit dem AIL konnte der Einsatz dieser revolutionären Technik in einem Umspannwerk der Austrian Power Grid getestet werden. Mit EPOS (kurz für: Exact Positioning Operating System) liefert Husqvarna nach eigener Aussage „den nächsten technologischen Durchbruch im Bereich des autonomen Mähens“. Anstatt verlegter Begrenzungskabel definieren beim EPOS-Mähroboter-System Satellitendaten den Arbeitsbereich der Mähroboter. Das EPOS-System von Husqvarna läuft bereits im Realbetrieb, 36 EPOS-Automower sind derzeit deutschlandweit auf Golfplätzen, öffentlichen Parkanlagen oder Firmengrundstücken unterwegs. Anwendung in Österreich Auch in Österreich kommt die EPOS-Technologie bereits zum Einsatz. Auf dem Gelände der Austrian Power Grid AG (APG), die von Wien aus das österreichweite Höchstspannungs-Stromnetz steuert, mäht der Automower kabellos rund um die Einzelteile einer Hochspannungsanlage. Dabei eröffnen sich ganz neue Anwendungsmöglichkeiten und Vorteile der EPOS-Lösung: Die zu mähende Rasenfläche befindet sich mitten im Schaltfeld, dessen Betreten für Personen nur nach vorheriger Sicherheitsunterweisung erlaubt ist. Auch die unzähligen Anlagenteile schränken die Rasenpflege massiv ein. Durch die vorherrschenden Spannungsfelder können zudem keine Kabel für die bewährte Installation der Mähroboter verlegt werden. Der EPOS-Automower ermöglicht erstmals konstante Mäharbeiten auf der Anlage. Paul Zachoval, Projektleiter für das EPOS-Projekt der APG, berichtet: „Bisher wurden die Mäharbeiten rund um die Strommasten nach aufwendiger Unterweisung von einem rund 20-köpfigen Spezialistenteam nur viermal im Jahr durchgeführt. Mit EPOS haben wir nun eine Lösung gefunden, die uns in Zukunft einen dauerhaft gepflegten Rasen auf dem Firmengelände ermöglicht – mit deutlich geringerem Aufwand.“ AIL testet neues Geschäftsmodell für Lagerhäuser Der Betrieb wird in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Agro Innovation Lab umgesetzt. Hierbei soll die Servicedienstleistung „Autonomes Grünflächenmanagement“ als neues Geschäftsmodell für die Raiffeisen-Lagerhäuser evaluiert werden. „Aufgrund unserer bisherigen Erfahrungen mit Mährobotern für landwirtschaftliche Flächen konnten wir schnell ein zusätzliches Anwendungsgebiet für diese vielversprechende Technologie identifizieren.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/so-wurde-stroh-zur-innovation/","AgroInnovationLab","So wurde Stroh zur Innovation","Landpack. Ein Start-up fand eine Alternative zu Styropor, Bauern dürfen sich über Zusatzeinkommen freuen Ein Ärgernis war der Anlass für eine Innovation. Thomas Maier-Eschenlohr hat sich immer wieder gefragt, warum seine Essenslieferungen in Styroporboxen verpackt waren. Der aus Erdöl hergestellte Kunststoff lässt sich nicht so einfachentsorgen. Also wurde das Start-up Landpack gegründet und nach einem Ersatz für den Kunststoff gesucht. „Wir haben festgestellt, dass es gar nicht so einfach ist, eine Alternative zu finden. Es geht nicht nur um die Nachhaltigkeit, sondern es müssen ja auch Leistungsdaten wie die Dämmfähigkeit von Styropor gegeben sein“, erzählt Maier-Eschenlohr. Der hohe Luftgehalt des Kunststoffs sorgt dafür, dass heiße Speisen heiß bleiben und sich kalte Speisen nicht leicht erwärmen. Ein Großteil der nachhaltigen Alternativen „war preislich so jenseitig, dass sie niemals wettbewerbsfähig sein können“. Einfache Lösung Dabei gibt es eine einfache Lösung des Problems, die der Landpack-Gründer beim agroinnovationlab der Raiffeisen Ware Austria (RWA) in Wien präsentierte. „Stroh ist der vergessene Werkstoff des 20. Jahrhunderts“, so der Gründer des Start-ups Landpack, das es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht hat, eine nachhaltigere Lösung anzubieten. „Wir haben sehr groß Mengen von Stroh auf den Feldern, die man nutzen kann. Es gab früher in Europa auch eine große Strohindustrie. Alle großen Papierfabriken haben früher Strohpapier hergestellt. Das war ein normales Material.“ Doch dann kamen die billige Baumwolle aus den USA und die Herstellung von Kunststoffen wurde zur Selbstverständlichkeit. Die europäische Faserindustrie mit Stroh, Hanf und Leinen musste zusperren. Übrig geblieben ist davon lediglich der Strohhalm, und der ist mittlerweile längst aus Kunststoff. In Dänemark wird Stroh heute in großen Heizkraftwerken verbrannt. Dabei hat Stroh einen sehr schlechten Leitwert und ist daher ein gute Isolator. Die Voraussetzungen für Stroh als Styroporersatz waren also gut. Allerdings gab es noch ein großes Problem. „Die entscheidende Frage war, wie bekommen wir Stroh in eine Form, ohne alles mit Kleber zuzukleistern“, beschreibt Maier- Eschenlohr das Problem. Stroh nicht teurer Also wurde ein eigenes Ingenieurbürogegründet, das für den Anlagenbau zuständig war. Es gelang, die technischen Fragen zu lösen. Mittlerweile gibt es eine Produktionsanlage in München und einen Kundenstock für das neue Dämmmaterial. Vor allem gibt es kein Preisproblem. „Stroh ist nicht teurer als Styropor. Wir beliefern Unternehmen, die ihre Styroporboxen ersetzen. Dazu gehören auch Pharmafirmen, die die Strohboxen für die Kühlung von Medikamenten benutzen“, freut sich der Start-up-Gründer. Man kontrolliere den Werkstoff genau und könne daher auch die notwendigen hygienischen Voraussetzungen kontrollieren. Genauso freuen sich die Bauern, die Stroh für das Dämmmaterial an Landpack liefern. Denn sie bekämen deutlich mehr dafür bezahlt, nämlich 150 statt der üblichen 80 Euro pro Tonne, betont Maier-Eschenlohr. Es geht als nicht nur um die Ökologisierung von Dämmmaterial, sondern auch um eine zusätzliche Einkommensquelle für die Landwirtschaft. Daher kommt auch das Interesse der RWA. „Wir suchen weltweit dynamische Startups, mit denen wir gemeinsam an zukunftsweisenden Lösungen für die Landwirtschaft arbeiten“, erklärt RWA Chef Reinhard Wolf den Zweck der Veranstaltung. So treffen sich die Interessen von RWA und Landpack. Es geht um Zukunftspläne: „Wie können wir wachsen, wie beliefern wir Kunden in Österreich, wer sorgt dort für den Absatz und wo bauen wir die nächste Fabrik. Wir möchten das nächste Werk in Österreich bauen. Die RWA hat uns großes Interesse signalisiert. Sie suchen einen Mehrwert für die Landwirte“, sagt Maier-Eschenlohr. Die Gespräche über eine Kooperation laufen. Ideensuche. Es geht darum, technische Innovationen für den Agrarbereich nutzbar zu machen. Jedes Jahr bewerben sich weltweit mehrere hundert Start-ups. Die Projekte sind sehr unterschiedlich. Beispiele: Der Einsatz moderner Technologien für das smart farming, wie etwa Drohnen. Oder Programme für die Optimierung der Düngung oder die Reduktion von Pflanzenschutzmitteln. Die RWA sucht jedes Jahr sechs Projekte aus, die in die nähere Auswahl als Kooperationspartner kommen. Neben Landpack (siehe Bericht oben) wurden heuer die Start-ups Cabasus, Biorfarm, Vitirover, Crop Intellect und Insylo ausgewählt. Cabasus hat eine Gerät entwickelt, das im Huf von Pferden platziert wird und den Besitzer rund um die Uhr über den Gesundheitszustand der Tiere informiert. Crop Intellect entwickelt Bio-Pestizide und Vitirover solarbetriebene Mähroboter. Biorfarm ist eine digitale Plattform für die Direktvermarktung von Obst.

Die Finalisten werden nun im Juli eine Onboarding-Phase durchlaufen, aus der die endgültigen Teilnehmer des diesjährigen Acceleration & Market Entry Programms hervorgehen. Mindestens sechs der neun Finalisten werden schließlich ab September in das fünfmonatige Programm starten. Seit 2016 lobt das AIL jedes Jahr einen Wettbewerb aus, mit dem Ziel, Innovationen im Agrarbereich frühzeitig zu entdecken und der Landwirtschaft durch die Förderung vielversprechender Start-ups nutzbar zu machen. 252 Start-ups aus 53 Ländern hatten sich in diesem Jahr um eine Teilnahme beworben. Eine Auswahl wurde vom 26. bis 28. Juni zu den „Finalist Days“ nach München eingeladen, um ihre Geschäftsmodelle zu präsentieren. Die ausgewählten Start-ups beschäftigen sich mit sehr unterschiedlichen Agrarthemen, von Innovationen für einen reduzierten Dünger- und Pflanzenschutzeinsatz bis hin zu cloudbasierten Agrarplattformen. Eines der Start-ups hat zum Beispiel einen solarbetriebenen Rasenmäh-Roboter als Glyphosat-Ersatz entwickelt. Weitere Projekte befassen sich mit einem Futtersilo-Sensor zur automatisierten Füllstandsmessung und Wiederauffüllung sowie einem Fitness-Gesundheits-Tracker für Pferde, der die Bewegungsabläufe der Tiere dokumentiert und auswertet. „Die große Bandbreite an Geschäftsmodellen zeigt, wie vielfältig Innovationen im Agrarbereich sind und welch großes Potenzial dahinter steckt“, sagt Reinhard Bauer, Geschäftsführer des Agro Innovation Lab. „Es macht mich stolz, dass sich für die aktuelle Programmrunde ähnlich viele Start-ups beworben haben wie 2017. Im Vergleich zu den Vorjahren haben wir die Auswahlkriterien leicht geändert und explizit die Start-ups angesprochen, die bereits erste Kunden überzeugen konnten und ihr Geschäft nun national und international ausbauen möchten.“ Seit der Gründung des AIL 2016 haben sich bisher mehr als 650 Start-ups aus rund 70 Ländern für eine Teilnahme am Acceleration Programm beworben. Zehn Jungunternehmen haben das Programm erfolgreich absolviert. Für zwei Start-ups mündete ihre Programmbeteiligung in einem Investment oder einer Kooperation mit der BayWa und RWA. Mit drei weiteren Unternehmen ist das AIL darüber hinaus in Gesprächen hinsichtlich eines Investments oder einer Kooperation.

Auch in dieser Saison konnten wir wieder mehr als 4.200 Hektar Maisfläche mit unseren Hexakoptern befliegen. Die enorme Zeitersparnis und das profunde Wissen über den idealen Ausbringungszeitpunkt machen dieses Service zu einer Erfolgsgeschichte der Lagerhäuser. Wie in den vergangenen Jahren waren wir auch heuer wieder mit unseren Hexakoptern im Burgenland, in Niederösterreich und in Oberösterreich mit der Ausbringung der sogenannten Trichogramma sehr erfolgreich. Dieses biologisch erprobte Verfahren führt zu keinen Resistenzbildungen der Schädlinge und stellt keine Gefahr für Bienen, Boden und Grundwasser dar. Mit einer Flugleistung von etwa 4 Minuten pro Hektar ist es uns möglich, die in Kugeln gepackten Schlupfwespen präzise und schnell auszubringen. In den abgeworfenen Kugeln befinden sich Schlupfwespen in unterschiedlichen Entwicklungsstadien, die innerhalb von zwei Wochen schlüpfen und ihre Eier in die Larven des Maiszünslers legen. Nach zwei Wochen erfolgt dann die zweite Ausbringung. Damit ist gewährleistet, dass in einem Zeitraum von einem Monat der Maiszünsler parasitiert wird.

Lichtdurchflutet, offen, zu allen Seiten hin mit der Umgebung draußen verbunden, so präsentiert sich das neue Bürogebäude, in dem wir nun unsere Heimat gefunden haben. Am Standort in Korneuburg waren bisher schon einige Bereiche der RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG untergebracht – nun wurde auf einer freien Fläche ein moderner Bürokomplex errichtet, der Platz für rund 500 Mitarbeiter bietet. Das neue Gebäude wurde nachhaltig und umweltfreundlich gebaut, es ist energieautark und wird mit Strom aus einer Photovoltaik-Anlage versorgt. Rund um das Gebäude laden Grünflächen ein, im Sommer auch draußen zu arbeiten und Meetings in die dafür geschaffenen Pavillons in der Wiese zu verlegen. Bei der Innenausstattung des neuen AIL-Büros wurde viel Wert auf die Verarbeitung von Holz gelegt. So entsteht trotz offener, gläserner Architektur ein heimeliges Büro-Ambiente, das nicht nur Platz für kreative Ideen z.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/wetterdaten-in-der-landwirtschaft/","AgroInnovationLab","Wetterdaten in der Landwirtschaft","Das Klima und die lokalen Wetterbedingungen sind für die Landwirtschaft zentrale Einflussfaktoren. Ereignisse wie Hitze, Dürre, Starkregen oder Frost bestimmen seit jeher den Alltag der Landwirtinnen und Landwirte. Der voranschreitende Klimawandel begünstigt derartige Extremwetterereignisse. Neueste Technologien helfen, diese Ereignisse vorherzusagen und darauf zu reagieren. Die Qualität des Ernteprodukts und die Ertragssicherheit sind stark an die vorherrschende Witterung gekoppelt. Da die Landbewirtschaftung vorwiegend im Freiland stattfindet, bestimmt das vorherrschende Klima, welche Fruchtarten grundsätzlich in der Bewirtschaftung möglich sind. Diese klimatischen Bedingungen lassen sich jedoch kaum beeinflussen. Durch Bewässerung kann fehlender Niederschlag kompensiert werden und ein Zuviel davon durch Drainagen abgeleitet werden. Für ein optimales Gedeihen ist aber nicht nur die Jahressumme des Niederschlages, sondern vor allem dessen zeitliche Verteilung maßgebend. Um das zu gewährleisten, gibt es sehr ausgereifte technische Möglichkeiten. Es werden beispielsweise Bodenfeuchtesensoren in verschiedenen Bodentiefen eingesetzt, um den täglichen Wasserverbrauch der Pflanze in den Bodenschichten zu messen. Der optimale Zeitpunkt für die Bewässerung wird dann über eine Software berechnet. Dies hilft sowohl Stress durch Dürre als auch Stress durch übermäßige Bewässerung zu vermeiden. Vorteile beim Einsatz von Bodensonden am Feld sind zum Beispiel die potentielle Reduzierung des Bewässerungsbedarfs oder Düngemitteleinsparung, was eine geringere Umweltbelastung mit sich bringt. Neben dem Niederschlag gehören auch die Bodentemperatur und die Bodenfeuchtigkeit zu den landwirtschaftlich wichtigsten Faktoren für den erfolgreichen Anbau von Nutzpflanzen. Die Bodentemperatur beeinflusst in Wechselwirkung mit der Tageslänge sowohl die Vitalität als auch die Entwicklungsgeschwindigkeit der Pflanze. Sinkt die Bodentemperatur auf unter 0° C, beginnt das Bodenwasser zu gefrieren. Das kann die Aufnahme von Flüssigdünger behindern und durch tagesperiodische Wechselfröste die Wurzeln reißen lassen. Weitere wichtige Faktoren sind Globalstrahlung, Lichtstärke, Luftfeuchtigkeit und Windgeschwindigkeiten. Erhebung der lokalen Daten Vermutlich keine andere Branche ist so eng mit dem Wetter verbunden wie die Landwirtschaft. Daher sind präzise Wetterdaten besonders wichtig. Neben der Fülle der Parameter, die das meteorologische Geschehen in der Atmosphäre beschreibt, gibt es einige Mess- und Beobachtungsgrößen, die im Zusammenhang mit der Landwirtschaft von Belang sind. Diese Daten werden mit Wetterstationen erfasst und können über eine Plattform oder eine App in Echtzeit dargestellt werden. Automatische Benachrichtigungen per SMS, z.B. Frostwarnungen, gehören mittlerweile zum Standard. Aktuelle Wetterstationen können eine Fülle von unterschiedlichen Sensoren beinhalten und sind leicht auf die individuellen Bedürfnisse anpassbar. Lufttemperatur, Globalstrahlung, Regenmesser, Windgeschwindigkeit, Blattnässe usw. sind nur einige Beispiele für die mannigfaltig einsetzbare Sensorik. Diese agrometrischen und andere umweltbezogenen Parameter werden gemessen, protokolliert und an die Plattform gesendet. Viele Hersteller von Wetterstationen bieten auf Basis dieser Werte zusätzliche Dienstleistungen an. Es können so lokalisierte Wettervorhersagen für ein sehr begrenztes Gebiet erstellt und auch Berechnungen von Pflanzenkrankheitsmodellen angeboten werden. Eine Automatisierung von Bewässerungssystemen ist mit einer präzisen Datenüberwachung ebenso möglich. Interpretation der Daten Aktuelles und historisches Wetter sind wichtig, um zu verstehen, was sich auf die Kulturen negativ auswirken könnte, während zukünftige Wetterdaten und Vorhersagen besonders wichtig für die Feldarbeitsplanung und zukünftige Vorgehensweisen sind. Bei Vorhersagen für die nächsten Minuten bis wenige Stunden im Voraus geht es darum, zum Beispiel kleinräumigen Starkregen, Hagel oder Böen in Verbindung mit Gewittern zu erfassen und mit guter Genauigkeit vorherzusagen. Es werden die lokalen Echtzeitmessungen der Wetterstation herangezogen, um nachträgliche Korrekturen in die modellierte Wettervorhersage einfließen zu lassen. So bekommen die Landwirtinnen und Landwirte eine maßgeschneiderte Wettervorhersage für ihre Felder und können besser planen oder bei unmittelbar drohenden Schauern oder zu starken Winden Arbeiten aufschieben. Ein weiteres Anwendungsgebiet ist die Prognose von Krankheiten, um den Einsatz von Pflanzenschutzmitteln effizient gestalten zu können. Durch die Zusammenführung der am Feld erhobenen Daten können Aussagen darüber getroffen werden, wie wahrscheinlich das Auftreten von Schädlingen und Pflanzenkrankheiten ist. Während die Vorhersage von Krankheiten berechnet wird, kann für die Detektion von Schädlingen auf teilautomatisierte Fallen zurückgegriffen werden. Dafür werden optisch hochauflösende Kamerasysteme zusammen mit Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software eingesetzt, um Insekten zu detektieren. Diese Art der Fernüberwachung des Insektendrucks hilft Zeit zu sparen und gezielt und nachhaltig zu handeln. Jede Kultur benötigt Wasser. Entscheidend ist jedoch zu wissen, wann die Pflanze Wasser braucht. Wie eingangs erwähnt, helfen hier Bodenfeuchtesensoren, die in unterschiedlichen Bodentiefen an unterschiedlichen Orten am Feld verteilt sind. So bekommt man einen sehr guten Überblick über den täglichen Wasserverbrauch der Pflanze in unterschiedlichen Bodenschichten. Eine dafür ausgelegte Software kann in weiterer Folge dabei helfen, den optimalen Zeitpunkt für die Bewässerung zu finden oder diese gleich ins Bewässerungsmanagement einfließen lassen. Datenübertragung Da es in der Regel auf dem Feld keine Infrastruktur für die kabelgebundene Datenübertragung oder Stromversorgung gibt, sind Wetterstationen darauf ausgelegt, mehrere Jahre autark zu funktionieren. Die Stromversorgung wird meist mittels Akku und Solarpanel sichergestellt. Abhängig davon, wie der Netzausbau ist und wie viele Daten übertragen werden müssen, kommen verschiedene Funktechnologien in Frage. Das sind einerseits die SIM-gebundenen, von Mobilfunkern bereitgestellten Funktechnologien wie NB-IoT, LTE-M und andererseits Übertragungstechniken wie Sigfox und LoRa. Diese Übertragungen gewährleisten niedrigere Kosten, geringen Stromverbrauch und hohe Reichweiten. Ausblick Die Digitalisierung ist in der Landwirtschaft längst angekommen. Die Erfassung der Daten am Feld ist nur ein kleiner, aber enorm wichtiger Baustein. Landwirtinnen und Landwirte setzen zunehmend auf vernetzte Maschinen und intelligente Geräte, die ihnen die tägliche Arbeit erleichtern. Die Digitalisierung ermöglicht es, mit innovativen Lösungen Betriebsabläufe zu optimieren und somit kosteneffizienter, nachhaltiger und umweltschonender zu arbeiten.

In Form von Humus wird organischer Kohlenstoff im Boden gebunden und wirkt sich dadurch positiv auf den CO2-Gehalt in der Luft aus. Damit dient der Humusaufbau sowohl der Landwirtschaft als auch dem Klima. Gemeinsam mit der Lagerhaus-Organisation möchten wir diese Chance mit den österreichischen LandwirtInnen nutzen und haben daher das Humusaufbau-Programm „Zukunft Erde“ gestartet. Humusaufbau soll belohnt werden. „Zukunft Erde“ ist ein neues Programm der Lagerhäuser und der RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria mit dem Ziel, den Humusaufbau in landwirtschaftlichen Böden zu forcieren. Das gelingt, indem Landwirte bei der Generierung von Humus nicht nur von gestärkten Böden profitieren, sondern zusätzlich im Rahmen des Programms aufgebauten Humus in regionale, freie CO2-Zertifikate umwandeln. Diese Zertifikate können von Unternehmen erworben werden, die sich klimaneutral stellen möchten. Dieser Prozess ist für Landwirte ein zusätzlicher Anreiz, Humus aufzubauen, und damit ein wichtiger Beitrag zum Klimaschutz. Zahlreiche internationale Initiativen, wie zum Beispiel die kürzlich präsentierte „Farm-to-fork-Strategie“ oder die „4 Promille-Initiative“, stellen die organische Kohlenstoffbindung in Böden in den Mittelpunkt. Gemeinsam mit dem Lagerhaus können Landwirte in Österreich die Möglichkeit nutzen, die positiven Maßnahmen für einen nachhaltigen Humusaufbau sichtbar zu machen. Eine nachhaltige, humusfördernde Bewirtschaftung hat zahlreiche Vorteile und wirkt sich natürlich auch positiv auf die Bodenbeschaffenheit aus, wie zum Beispiel durch verbesserte Wasserspeicherfähigkeit aktives Bodenleben oder den stärkeren Erosionsschutz. Was ist Humus? Humus wird als fruchtbare Erde bezeichnet und befindet sich in der obersten Schicht des Bodens. Er besteht aus vielen verschiedenen organischen Verbindungen von Pflanzen (Wurzel- und Erntereste, Wurzelausscheidungen) und Mikroorganismen (Mikroorganismen-Ausscheidungen und tote Mikroorganismen), die im Boden stabilisiert werden. Humus trägt zur Wasserspeicherung und Nährstoffversorgung der Pflanze bei und bindet zusätzlich noch CO2. Definiert ist Humus als organischer Kohlenstoff im Boden, jedoch wird er erst durch die Verbindung mit dem Mineralboden als Ton-Humus-Komplexe oder in Bodenaggregaten gegen weiteren Abbau stabilisiert. Was passiert beim Humusaufbau? Der im Boden vorhandene Humus besteht aus 58 % Kohlenstoff. Gelingt es, den Humusgehalt im Boden langfristig zu steigern, wird damit auch mehr an Kohlenstoff langfristig gespeichert und gelangt nicht als CO2 in die Atmosphäre. Humusaufbau bedeutet also, dass ein Teil des Kohlenstoffs, der in der Pflanze gebunden wurde, nicht wieder freigesetzt, sondern stabil im Boden gespeichert wird , vor allem an Ton- und Schluffoberflächen, Eisenoxiden und in Bodenaggregaten. Mit „Zukunft Erde“ Humus aufbauen und profitieren Mit dem Programm „Zukunft Erde“ haben österreichische Landwirte nun die Möglichkeit, doppelt zu profitieren. Zum einen durch eine gesteigerte Bodenaktivität und verbesserte Bodenfruchtbarkeit, zum anderen durch eine finanzielle Gegenleistung für den gebundenen Kohlenstoff im Boden. Nach der Anmeldung (via Onfarming oder im Lagerhaus) zieht das Lagerhaus Bodenproben-Team je max. 5 ha eine Bodenprobe und analysiert den Humusgehalt und auf Wunsch weitere Parameter. Nach frühestens 3 Jahren kann die zweite Probe erfolgen und der Humusgehalt wird erneut ermittelt. Sollte Humusaufbau – und damit die Bindung von CO2 – erfolgt sein, erhält der Teilnehmer dafür eine finanzielle Gegenleistung. Die Höhe ist abhängig vom zukünftigen Vermarktungspreis für CO2-Zertifikate zum jeweiligen Zeitpunkt. Ein Drittel der Auszahlung wird einbehalten und erst nach einer dritten Beprobung (wieder frühestens 3 Jahre später) ausgezahlt, sofern der Humusgehalt gehalten oder weiter ausgebaut wird. Sollte Humus wieder abgebaut werden, entfällt die restliche Zahlung. Durch die Steigerung des Humusaufbaus leistet die Landwirtschaft einen wesentlichen Beitrag zum Klima- und Umweltschutz.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/de/zukunft-erde-update-zum-humusaufbau-programm/","AgroInnovationLab","ZUKUNFT ERDE – Update zum Humusaufbau-Programm","Aktuell werden verschiedenste Aspekte rund um die Speicherung von CO2 durch den Aufbau von Humus und dessen Messung intensiv diskutiert. Darunter fallen unter anderem Themen wie Genauigkeit der Messung durch Analyse von Bodenproben, großflächiges Humus-Monitoring durch Satellitendaten, Humusaufbau-Potential in Abhängigkeit von natürlichen Gegebenheiten und Bewirtschaftung sowie auch das Thema des Humus-Zertifikatehandels und dessen Bedeutung. Nichtsdestotrotz, oder gerade deshalb, ist das Interesse der LandwirtInnen für das Thema sehr groß und wir bekommen laufend neue Anmeldungen für unsere Initiative. Aufgrund der positiven Eigenschaften von Humus für die Böden ist dies für sich genommen schon positiv zu bewerten. Humus-Bedeutung Die Wichtigkeit von natürlichen Kohlenstoffsenken ist unbestritten. Durch welche Maßnahmen und wie stark sich aber die Gesamtmenge von gespeichertem CO2 pro Flächeneinheit bei agrarisch genutzten Böden langfristig steigern lässt, wird aktuell noch angeregt diskutiert. Klar ist, dass der Aufbau von Humus ein langfristiges Projekt ist und nicht linear nach oben geht, sondern Schwankungen unterliegt, unter anderem fruchtfolgebedingt. Humus-Wissen Um als LandwirtIn erfolgreich Humusaufbau betreiben zu können, ist man deshalb gut beraten – aufbauend auf dem aktuellsten Wissensstand –, standortangepasste Strategien für die praktische Umsetzung auf dem eigenen Betrieb zu entwickeln. Ein nachhaltiger Humusaufbau erfordert meist eine gesamtbetriebliche Umstellung von Fruchtfolge, Arbeitsweise und eingesetzter Technik. Dies ist notwendig, um eine dauerhafte Steigerung des mittleren Humusgehalts auf den bewirtschafteten Flächen erreichen zu können und somit langfristig als CO2-Senke zu dienen. Um die LandwirtInnen dabei zu unterstützen, wird von einer Arbeitsgruppe unter Federführung des Bundesministeriums für Landwirtschaft, Regionen und Tourismus gerade eine Informationsbroschüre zu dem Themenkomplex Humus erarbeitet. Es freut uns ganz besonders, dass wir uns von Seiten des AIL bei den Diskussionen in der Arbeitsgruppe einbringen konnten. Die Broschüre soll insbesondere BeraterInnen bei ihrer Tätigkeit unterstützen sowie auch interessierten LandwirtInnen als Quelle für grundlegende Informationen dienen. Das „Zukunft Erde“-Programm der Lagerhäuser und RWA wird auch in der Broschüre, neben anderen Projekten und Initiativen, vertreten sein. Land and Soil Management Award Wir haben uns auch beim diesjährigen „Land and Soil Management Award“ der European Landowners‘ Organization mit dem Programm „Zukunft Erde“ beworben. Insgesamt haben knapp 20 Initiativen eine Bewerbung für diesen Preis eingereicht. Neben dem Gewinnerprojekt aus Slowenien wurden aufgrund der Qualität der weiteren Einreichungen insgesamt vier „diploma of recognition“ vergeben, wovon auch wir erfreulicherweise eines für unser Projekt „Zukunft Erde“ bekommen konnten. Wir freuen uns über weitere Anmeldungen und die stetige Weiterentwicklung unseres Programms „Zukunft Erde“.

Contacts with eFriends had already been established at the end of 2019 – via AIL. eFriends offers an innovative platform technology that enables users to share self-produced solar power with other users in real time. This works via a new type of technology that can be easily installed in the distribution box. By acquiring its stake, RWA sent a clear signal of support for innovation and for sustainable approaches based on cooperative start-ups, especially in the current challenging situation. This partnership pursues the goals of jointly promoting solar power and other renewable forms of energy and of networking regional producers. Several years ago, eFriends founder and CEO Matthias Katt had the idea of developing a technology that would enable anyone and everyone to share domestically produced solar power with others in real time and regardless of location. On the basis of these initial approaches and ideas, eFriends Energy GmbH finally emerged as a supplier of green electricity in 2018. Two years later, RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria has now taken a stake of around 24 per cent in eFriends Energy GmbH – which includes 500 households and is Austria’s largest energy community – through its corporate venture capital company, RWA Invest GmbH.

Today, eight startups from around the world have been announced as the finalists to compete in the Pitch Day competition: US-based Agrospheres, Aromyx, Napigen, Traive, Brazil-based AgTrace, Australia-based EscaVox, Turkey-based Tarfin and Kenya-based Tulaa. All eight finalists will benefit from pre-pitch coaching ahead of the summit from Radicle Growth, who will invest $250k in the Pitch Day winner. Hundreds of seed-stage startups representing diverse technology offerings for the agtech and foodtech sectors applied to participate in the Pitch Day. A panel of judges, including Radicle’s Kirk Haney, Arama Kukutai (Finistere Ventures), Geoff Kneen (Bayer, Crop Science), Mai Komatsu (Corteva AgriScience) and Adrian Percy (Independent Advisor), evaluated the submissions and selected the finalists. The Pitch Day winner will be announced on the first day of the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit (March 19) and will present within the start-up Technology Showcase on March 20 to over 1,200 global agribusinesses and investors, unlocking powerful opportunities for growth. Commenting on the entries, Kirk Haney, Managing Partner of Radicle Growth, said: “Once again, we saw a fantastic response for participation in the Pitch Day competition, with hundreds of entries from innovators around the world. Now is an exciting time for agtech innovators and investors, and we’re delighted to support their route to market with this platform to showcase their solutions and to benefit from our $250k investment and mentoring. We look forward to the presentations and to working with the selected winner.” The eight finalists: Agrospheres (US) has developed a platform technology for encapsulation of biomolecules and synthetic chemicals. It is developing biological-based crop protection products for the control of thrips and fungi, also working with partners to improve the delivery and efficacy of pesticides and the delivery of double-stranded RNA. AgTrace (Brazil) is a traceability solution that ensures transparency and information reliability, reducing response time to issues within the food value chain. Based on deep knowledge of farming processes and advanced IoT and blockchain technologies, AgTrace guarantees information security about agriculture processes, using sensors and equipment to register information from inside and outside the farm. Aromyx (US) enables the creation of quantitative digital representations of taste and smell, by isolating natural human olfactory receptors and converting them to a standardized diagnostic format. Its olfactory database provides a basis for machine learning to analyze flavors and fragrances, offering revolutionary precise quality control diagnostics to compare crops from different locations or production times, and to resolve issues of off-flavors or contaminant. EscaVox (Australia) has the ambition to help transform the food supply chains to allow better decisions to be made, allowing waste to be reduced and food safety increased. It uses cleverly designed software to import and connect various data sets, then analyses and identifies problem areas. It combines this with tracking data to give the full end to end impact on the product – the ‘voice’ of the product. Napigen (US) offers mitochondrial CRISPR genome editing, with the goal to create a new platform for hybrid wheat seed production by providing elite male sterile and restoration lines that are uniquely produced by our genome editing tools, introducing robust, non-GMO, male sterile and restoration lines. The hybrid wheat platform will stack valuable traits such as herbicide tolerance and biotic/abiotic stress tolerance without losing their value by undesirable self-propagation. Tarfin (Turkey) provides farmers with instant, competitive point-of-sale credit terms for their farm inputs purchases. Using proprietary algorithms and an expansive retail network, Tarfin’s machine-learning-based credit algorithms instantly assess a farmer’s likelihood of repayment. Transactional as well as farm level data are taken into account, helping the company convert more leads into sales. Traive (US) is an ag-fintech solution that unlocks credit to farmers by connecting them to lenders and providing ML-based credit risk assessment and monitoring. Traive brings farmers state-of-the-art technology to offer a novel and fair credit risk assessment, opening the door for affordable funding for their businesses. For lenders, Traive provides a differentiated analysis applied over alternative farming and individual data, while allowing access to a much larger and diversified portfolio of borrowers. Tulaa (Kenya) is a marketplace for smallholder farmers in Africa to access inputs, credit, training and buyers. Using mobile technology and artificial intelligence, Tulaa enables farmers to buy inputs like fertilizer on credit, receive training on good agricultural practices, and to find buyers at harvest time.

Back in 2017, the Agro Innovation Lab Acceleration Program and three pilot Lagerhäuser marked the start of Farmhedge’s success story in Austria. Today, two years later, Farmhedge has developed into the number one digital communication channel of the Lagerhaus Group. In 25 out of 38 cooperatives farmers have the opportunity to convince themselves of Farmhedge’s advantages: They can both receive customized offers directly on their smartphone and profit from the possibility of selling their own produce – very easily, in just a few clicks. One decisive factor behind Farmhedge’s stunning performance is clearly its great user-friendliness for both farmers and their suppliers. “Farmhedge allows me to create customized offers and to reach out to all the right customers in just a few seconds. And what’s more, I can track their response in real time!” comments Rudolf Grubauer, Head of Agricultural Business at Lagerhaus Hollabrunn. “We are planning to expand Farmhedge’s reach over the course of the coming months, and nationwide availability is, naturally, our ultimate goal,” states Claudia Mittermayr, Head of Farming Innovations (RWA), who has overseen the collaboration between Farmhedge and RWA and the Lagerhaus Group since the end of last year.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/farmhedge-update/","AgroInnovationLab","FarmHedge – Update","FarmHedge, the sales app of farmers and the Lagerhäuser, was able to expand its market share in Austria in 2020 while also enjoying international success. In 2017, FarmHedge began its successful cooperation with the Agro Innovation Lab, RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG, and the Lagerhäuser. While three test Lagerhaus cooperatives were initially involved in the project, the number of participating Lagerhaus cooperatives grew to 27 in 2020. The app enables the Lagerhäuser to send “spot offers” to around 3,000 farmers, or customers, who can then, in turn, order the product directly via the app – which is linked to their Lagerhaus account. In addition to this, farmers can also use the app to directly offer their products to the Lagerhäuser and to process sales. With the help of such activities, turnover passed the three-million-euro mark in 2020. While agricultural spot offers and product purchases remain the core of the FarmHedge offer, the platform has developed significantly in the past two years. FarmHedge is now also offering its first digital solutions for agricultural companies outside Austria. In autumn 2020, for example, the first version of a peer-to-peer trading platform was launched, initially as a means of trading seeds between RWA subsidiaries in eight Central and Eastern European countries. And in its local Irish and British markets, a current focus of FarmHedge is the development of customized solutions for feed trading between producers and end customers. In addition to expanding its activities in Ireland, the UK, and Eastern Europe, a primary objective of FarmHedge in 2021 is to enter the German market. RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG holds a 22% stake in FarmHedge. ","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FarmHedge_Logo_Black-e1610012512997.png","16.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/fawn-rescue/","AgroInnovationLab","Fawn Rescue","Every year in Austria thousands of fawns die an agonising death during mowing. But modern technology means that the search for the young is easier than ever. A drone, equipped with a thermal imaging camera, is the ideal tool for finding the small animals in the tall grass. Both the duration of and the number of people required for the search can thus be drastically reduced. Fawns, which weigh about 1,200 grams at birth, have the so-called “pressing instinct” for the first three weeks of their life. They press themselves flat on the ground, do not move and hope not to be discovered. Since the fawns are almost odourless they are very hard to discover, even for dogs. This strategy works very well against predators such as fox, lynx or wild boar. However, it is deadly when the mower approaches. Therefore, hunters and farmers search every field for roe deer fawns before mowing. But this search is not only carried out in the interest of the endangered animals. If the carcass of an animal ends up in a silo after mowing, toxins are formed in the hay and grass silage during decomposition and these can be deadly for cattle and other farm animals. For example, so-called botulism can lead to miscarriages in cattle. Drones are being increasingly used to make the search easier and more efficient. Very small, commercially available and relatively inexpensive drones, mostly quadcopters, equipped with thermal imaging cameras, are well suited for this purpose. Due to their handiness and easy handling they are an ideal companion for animal rescuers. The search should be carried out before sunrise when the temperature difference between the fawn and its surroundings is the greatest and it is thus easier for the thermal imaging camera to recognise the animals. Later, when the sun is shining on the field, it is difficult to distinguish them from heated objects such as stones or mounds. The drone flies between previously planned waypoints. This automatic flight mode is important because manual control may not ensure that the entire surface is covered, with the right amount of overlapping. In order to be able to process the search quickly, the area plan is transmitted to the drone pilot in advance so that they can create the flight plan. Time is critical in this context, because many farmers in the same region often want to mow at the same time and the search by drone is only useful before sunrise. At least two people must be present during the search: a drone pilot and a hunter or helper who can bring any fawn that is found out of the field. While the quadcopter is flying over the field, possible finding places are marked. It then approaches these places. The helper is equipped with a tablet on which they can see both themself and the fawn as bright spots. This enables them to bring the fawn out of the field. During a recent deer fawn rescue with the hunt company in Oberhautzental (Lower Austria), numerous hunters were able to make themselves familiar with the technology and experience the deer fawn rescue by drone at first hand. The aim is to expand the service and make it more widely available regionally by next season, starting in spring 2021.

Flooded with light, open, and connected with its surroundings on every side, is the impression created by the new office building in which we have now found our home. The Korneuburg facility already accommodated some departments of RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG – now a modern office complex with space for around 500 employees has been built on a vacant plot. The new building was constructed in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner; it is self-sufficient in terms of energy and supplied with electricity from a photovoltaic system. Green spaces around the building invite people to work outside in summer and to hold meetings in the pavilions created for this purpose in the meadow. The interior design of the new AIL office placed great importance on the use of wood. This creates a homely office ambience despite the open, glass architecture, which not only offers space for creative ideas, e.g. in the lounge area, but is also equipped with modern, quiet telephone boxes for telephone meetings.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/new-in-our-team-mariella-schultes/","AgroInnovationLab","New in our team: Mariella Schultes","What is it like to be an Innovation Manager at the Agro Innovation Lab? The tasks are very diverse. No day is like any other. Basically, we have three different roles as Innovation Managers: We are agile project managers, networkers, and start-up experts. What does this mean? As agile project managers we are responsible for several projects at the same time. These can be individual cooperations with start-ups or with RWA subsidiaries, or also projects related to our various formats, such as acceleration programs or innovation challenges. Furthermore, as an Innovation Manager it is very important to foster your network, both internally and externally. Within the organization, this gives you a good overview of the chances and challenges in the RWA’s individual business segments. Outside the organization, it is of course always important to get to know interesting startups. Due to our experience with a range of startup projects, we are also startup experts. This means that we identify cooperations that make sense for both sides – RWA and the startup itself. However, as I have only been with the Agro Innovation Lab for a relatively short time, I haven’t yet experienced all the tasks of an Innovation Manager. Is this how you imagined it? Yes and no. The three roles of an Innovation Manager were communicated in the job posting and at the interview and I also expected to be responsible for a variety of tasks. So from this perspective, yes, this is how I imagined it. Nevertheless, the “information overload” at the beginning was something of a surprise. In addition to the internal processes and the projects that I was able to take on from the very beginning, I became aware of the complexity the agricultural sector and of how much I can still learn about it. My background is in innovation management and although I have read extensively about agricultural issues, I will certainly build up a lot more knowledge in this area over the next few years. What do you particularly like about the Agro Innovation Lab? The fact that I was involved in all activities from the very beginning and that I was given responsibility from day one. After less than two weeks, I made my first presentation to a potential cooperation partner. That was a challenge for me, but I had a steep learning curve. As we always have new projects I am convinced that I will continuously learn something new at the Agro Innovation Lab. Why did you want to work at the Agro Innovation Lab? In my opinion, innovation in agriculture is particularly interesting. There is a lot of change in this sector – because of not only climate change, but also increasing labor shortages and upcoming regulations – and this makes innovation extremely important. I wanted to contribute to finding innovative solutions in agriculture and for this reason, I decided to join the Agro Innovation Lab. Another reason was the team. In the second round of interviews at the AIL I got to know the whole team and had the impression that I could work very well with them – and this impression has been confirmed. Please describe a typical day as an Innovation Manager at the Agro Innovation Lab. My typical day starts between 8 and 9 o’clock with a cup of coffee or a tea. I usually answer my e-mails first, before going through my to-do list and checking my calendar. Then I work on my projects and I have phone calls and meetings with my colleagues or potential cooperation partners. I work very closely with my colleague Hannes, the other Innovation Manager at the Agro Innovation Lab. We often exchange ideas and think about new concepts for future projects. We also have a weekly jour fixe when the whole team – David, Sebastian, Andrea, Hannes and I – come together to discuss our projects, organizational matters or whatever else is on the agenda. Have there already been moments when you have had to step out of your comfort zone? A few weeks ago, I visited the Farm & Food fair in Berlin. The aim was to learn about the latest trends in agriculture and thus stay up-to-date in our role as RWA’s innovation platform. Of course, networking is also a very important aspect of such events. Simply approaching strangers was initially a fairly unfamiliar experience for me, so I had to step out of my comfort zone. But everyone was really nice and open and it was great fun to meet so many exciting new people from the agricultural sector and to tell them about the Agro Innovation Lab. Which three words best describe your experience at the Agro Innovation Lab? Spontaneously “never stop learning” comes to mind. In my opinion, this is a very good description of our work at the AIL.","https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/csm_Mariella_NewsArtikel_36da371b48.jpg","30.

Profile Lena Ranneberg, 26 Position: Innovation Manager Contact: l.ranneberg@agroinnolab.com or www.linkedin.com/in/lena-ranneberg First working day: Dec 10th 2020 This is the experience that I bring with me… … before I came to AIL, I studied in Weihenstephan (D), Hohenheim (D), and Wageningen (NL). I was able to gain practical agricultural experience on farms in Germany, Austria, France, and the Netherlands. In addition to working on classic arable and dairy farms, I also gained fascinating insights into aquaponics, insect farming, beekeeping, permaculture, and the cultivation of algae. In the past two years, I have been able to gain experience in start-up consultancy and marketing by working at a management consultancy alongside my studies and have also been active in the project management of a start-up competition since 2018. This is particularly important to me in my work… … I am very keen to implement practical innovations that support the RWA departments and the Lagerhäuser and, above all, help farmers to position themselves for the future and successfully manage their farms. And alongside these solutions that already offer added value today, it is also important to me not to lose sight of “the solutions of tomorrow” and to gain expertise in these at an early stage. These are the topics that I will support in AIL… … in the coming years, the focus will be on innovations in digitalization, automation, and sustainability. I am involved with robotics solutions in crop production as well as emission reduction in agriculture. I am also responsible for organizing a range of innovation formats and events for the departments. I am always available when ideas arise in these areas and when there is a need to find the best way of implementing them. That’s what interests me beyond my work… … what I like most is cycling, walking, or skiing in the mountains. I always spend my holidays backpacking somewhere in the world and enjoy exotic food. Since I’ve only been in Vienna for a short time, I’m also looking forward to discovering the city and am of course always open for tips here. Here’s to some successful cooperation!

And also in the right quantity for the optimal yield. This is exactly what becomes possible when smart farming technology that is ideally adapted to subareas is used for the cultivation of agricultural land. As part of a two-year project carried out in cooperation with nine participating project farmers, we were able to build up know-how and practical experience for the Lagerhaus and RWA network in the area of the sowing and N-fertilisation of grain maize. The “Subarea Pilot Project”, which focuses on the subarea-specific (variable rate) cultivation of grain maize, was launched in autumn 2017. The TalkingFields base map (TF base map) was used as the basis for adjusting the sowing density and quantity of N-fertiliser in each subarea. Satellite data gathered over several years shows that this has led to consistent, relative biomass differences and allows conclusions to be drawn about the distribution of yield and soil quality on the plot. Application maps with a resolution of 10 x 10 m were created on the basis of this data. Experimental setup In addition to variant 0 with a homogeneous output quantity, variants A, D and AD were also created: – Variant A: Variation of the sowing density – Variant D: Variation of the quantity of N-fertiliser – Variant AD: Variation of the sowing density and the quantity of N-fertiliser The total area under grain maize cultivation amounted to approx. 100 ha per trial year, distributed over about ten fields. The most widely used variety of maize was DieSONJA and the most widely used N-fertiliser was the stabilised fertiliser ALZON® neo-N. Technology for the subarea A 6155R John Deere tractor, an eight-row Monosem precision air seeder and a Rauch Axis fertiliser spreader were used in the project. All machines were ISOBUS-compatible and had the TC-GEO certification required for site-specific cultivation. The technical implementation of site-specific cultivation within the framework of the project was very satisfactory. Particular attention must be paid to the compatibility of the software versions of the individual machines. Test results Taking the average of both years, Variant A achieved an additional yield of approx. 3.3 per cent while Variant D only achieved an additional yield of approx. 1.7 per cent. The combined variant achieved an average additional yield of 3.4 per cent. In some areas of the trial, additional yields in the range of 5 to 7 per cent were also achieved. Conclusions In some cases, the yield responded very well to variations in the sowing density during the project. Varying the amount of N-fertiliser in grain maize also had some effect in the same year, but less effect than varying the sowing density. In any event, subarea-specific fertilisation should be considered over several years, ideally with the support of zoned soil sampling. The basis for the success of subarea-specific cultivation is the systematic development of a sound database for the individual fields of a farm. On the basis of this data, specific application maps can be created for each of a range of applications.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/robotics-power-for-austrian-substations/","AgroInnovationLab","Robotics power for Austrian substations","Husqvarna Austria GmbH has launched EPOS, a new product in the robotic mower division. A test carried out together with AIL demonstrated the use of this revolutionary technology at a substation of Austrian Power Grid. According to Husqvarna, EPOS (Exact Positioning Operating System) is “the next technological breakthrough in autonomous mowing”. Instead of laying boundary wires, the EPOS robotic mower system uses satellite data to define the working area of the robotic mower. Husqvarna’s EPOS system is already in function, with 36 EPOS Automowers currently operating throughout Germany on golf courses, public parks, and business premises. Application in Austria EPOS technology is also already being used in Austria. At the premises of Austrian Power Grid AG (APG), which controls the Austria-wide extra-high voltage electricity grid from Vienna, the Automower mows wirelessly around the individual parts of a high-voltage installation. This demonstrates the completely new potential applications and advantages of the EPOS solution: The lawn to be mowed is located in the middle of the switchgear field, where people are only allowed to enter after receiving safety instructions. The many system components also massively restrict the ability to tend to the lawn. Furthermore, the prevailing voltage fields mean that no cables can be laid for the tried-and-tested installation of the mowing robots. The EPOS Automower is the first to permit the constant mowing of the site. Paul Zachoval, project manager for APG’s EPOS project, reports: “Previously, the area around the electricity pylons was only mowed four times a year by a team of around 20 specialists after extensive instruction. With EPOS, we have found a solution that will enable us to have a permanently well-maintained lawn on the company premises in future – with significantly less effort.” AIL tests a new business model for the Lagerhäuser The solution is being provided in collaboration with the Agro Innovation Lab. It will allow the service “Autonomous Green Space Management” to be evaluated as a new business model for the Raiffeisen Lagerhäuser. “Thanks to our previous experience with mowing robots for agricultural areas, we were able to quickly identify an additional area of application for this promising technology. Our goal is to offer interested Lagerhäuser an attractive business model for the ongoing management of the mowing robots,” explains Hannes Schauer, Innovation Manager at the Agro Innovation Lab.

Weed control is time-consuming and cost-intensive work, particularly in special crops. Organic farming and restrictions on plant protection products also require effective, alternative solutions. In 2019, AIL’s Robotics Challenge laid the foundation for advancing agriculture with the help of fully autonomous systems. An exclusive dealer agreement with the French manufacturer of chopping robots, Naio Technologies, has been in place since April. Naio Technologies is based in Toulouse, France. Packed with top technical expertise, the team of engineers in robotics, mechanics, and agronomy launched its vision in 2010. Hence, Naio Technologies has almost ten years’ experience and is the global market leader in agricultural robots. In spring 2020, Naio Technologies and RWA concluded an exclusive dealer agreement. This will enable Austrian farmers to become fit for an automated future with the help of RWA. Naio Technologies’ portfolio currently comprises three different machines. The autonomous chopping robot Oz makes it possible to remove weeds between rows that are spaced at least 65 cm apart. Oz is particularly useful in tree nurseries as well as in vegetable and spice farms where a performance of 1 ha per day is required. From 2021, Oz will be available to interested farmers for rent or purchase via RWA/AIL. The Naio range features the Dino robot for bedding crops such as lettuce, leeks, and onions. It is suitable for row distances of 160-210 cm and can cover up to 5 ha per day. Dino makes it easy to hoe weeds between the rows and, in the case of certain crops, even hoes the rows themselves. Numerous tools can be attached to the basic vehicle. In 2021, RWA will enable interested farmers to see demonstrations of the Dino robot at work. The third robot in the collection is the vineyard robot Ted, which can be used to mechanically control weeds below the vines and also, in particular, between the individual vines in the row. With its external width of 135 to 180 cm, a wide range of tools can also be attached to Ted. The electric power unit enables Ted to work for up to eight hours, during which it can cultivate up to 40 ha. Demonstrations of Ted can also be organized via RWA. In 2021, AIL is looking forward to helping farmers to become more familiar with robotics and the automation of labor-intensive activities. The key arguments for the use of robots in agriculture include the resulting long-term independence from external labor, increased efficiency, and the specific solutions for organic farming, all of which offer Austrian farmers a viable perspective for the future. AIL is currently working together with the Lagerhaus Technik Center to create an attractive portfolio of services in the field of automation.

They will be joined by the finalists of the Radicle Challenge and World Agri-Tech Pitch Day, alongside dozens more innovators taking advantage of the summit’s special rates for start-ups to maximize their opportunties to learn and network with industry leaders and investors. The World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit takes place twice per year in San Francisco and London, generating valuable opportunities for networking, knowledge exchange and deal-making among its international delegation of agribusinesses, technology providers, entrepreneurs and investors. Full information on the summit, agenda, opportunities and delegate registration is available at www.worldagritechusa.com Spargel und Erdbeeren Einer davon kann Spargel ernten – das Problem Erntehelfer im Marchfeld zu finden, würde gelöst, außerdem kann der Roboter identifizieren, welcher Spargel erntereif ist und welcher noch im Boden bleibt. Ein anderer soll den Erdbeeranbau und die -ernte erleichtern: Durch UV-Behandlung wird Mehltau (die größte Herausforderung im Anbau) reduziert, auch an einem Erntehelfer wird gearbeitet. Zudem gibt es Roboter, die für die Unkrautregulierung und den Pflanzenschutz eingesetzt werden, sie können erkrankte oder unerwünschte Pflanzen mit Hilfe von umfangreichen Datenbanken identifizieren und zielgerichtet mit Pflanzenschutzmitteln behandeln. „So kann der Einsatz von Herbiziden verringert und auf das Glyphosatverbot reagiert werden“, betont AIL-Geschäftsführer David Saad. Saad und Metzker sind sich einig, dass sich die Roboter-Technologie gerade in diesem Bereich in den nächsten zehn Jahren durchsetzen wird. „Der Trend geht zur Bio-Landwirtschaft, immer mehr Betriebe stellen um. Da ist die Entwicklung der Robotertechnologie besonders spannend“, sagt Saad. Die Prototypen, die im Rahmen der Robotics Challenge getestet werden, kosten von 100.000 Euro an aufwärts. Die RWA denkt an ein Genossenschaftsmodell: „Wir wollen die Technik für die Landwirte zugänglich machen, da können wir uns bei größeren Geräten Mietmodelle vorstellen“, so Metzker. Gesetzlicher Rahmen Derzeit gibt es aber abseits der Finanzierung noch eine andere Schwierigkeit: Die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen sind nicht gegeben. „Es gibt noch keine Regulatorien. Bevor man die Technik zur Serienreife bringt, muss die Gesetzgebung festlegen, was erlaubt ist und was nicht“, sagt Saad. Dabei geht es zum Beispiel darum, wie groß die Geräte sein dürfen, die ohne das Beisein von Menschen unterwegs sind oder welche Sicherheitskriterien beim Einsatz von Robotern eingehalten werden müssen. Außerdem interessant: Alle vorgestellten Prototypen des Wettbewerbs besitzen Verbrennungsmotoren. „Bei Elektroantrieben wären die Kosten für die Batterien enorm hoch. Außerdem glauben wir, dass Landwirte sich eher einen Roboter zulegen, bei dem sie im Notfall selbst kleine Reparaturen durchführen können“, erläutert David Saad. Die beiden Experten sagen zudem, dass die Landwirte sehr aufgeschlossen gegenüber den neuen technischen Möglichkeiten seien, die durch Künstliche Intelligenz geboten werden.

The six winning start-ups of this year’s round of applications presented the progress made in developing their business ideas to market readiness in front of around 300 guests. The AIL is a joint innovation platform of BayWa AG and RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria AG whose purpose is to discover innovations in the agricultural sector and actively help shape them further. 265 start-ups from 61 countries applied to take part in the Acceleration Programme 2017. “Together with the start-ups, we have supported the further development of these innovative approaches to enable their sustainable use for agriculture and, therefore, for the benefit of our customers,” says Klaus-Josef Lutz, Chief Executive Officer of BayWa AG. Among other things, pilot projects were launched, products made ready for series production, business plans developed, detailed market analyses prepared or cooperation agreements made with strategic partners. “In two out of six cases we have already successfully started activity on the market,” said Lutz. FarmHedge from Ireland, for example, is an online platform for the creation of purchasing and sales cooperatives and is expected to be available to Austrian farmers later this year. Prominent dealers have already shown interest in the web-based platform for the sale of slow moving spare parts, BartParts, based in the Netherlands, and have already sold parts via this platform in Germany and Austria. Together with Agra2b from Germany, which is working on an online marketplace for farmers, the AIL has prepared large scale tests and identified relevant target areas in Germany. Drone Clouds from South Africa uses drone and satellite data in agriculture for the early detection of potential threats presented by pests, plant diseases or water supply issues. Working with the AIL has resulted in cooperation projects in South Africa and Germany. The Chinese-Austrian cooperation LivinFarms, which focuses on mealworm breeding, designed its first pilot plant and found farmers interested in this plant. The reduction of available farmland means food and fodder production are in competition with each other. This approach claims insects may be an alternative to protein-rich fodder plants currently being cultivated. Livestock Technologies from South Korea also took important steps forward: The start-up is now able to accurately predict calving time by means of sensor technology in a cow’s rumen and provide accurate information on the state of health of individual animals. The next step will be talks on possible cooperation partnerships and financing opportunities, in order to maintain close connections with the start-ups in the future. The application round for the Acceleration Programme 2018 starts in March. Since 2016, the Agro Innovation Lab has been inviting start-ups from the agricultural sector worldwide to apply for participation with their business idea.

This season, we were again able to fly over more than 4,200 hectares of corn with our hexacopters. The enormous time savings and the profound knowledge about the ideal application time make this service a success story for Lagerhaus. As in previous years, we were very successful with the production of the so-called trichogramma with the help of our hexacopters in Burgenland, Lower Austria and Upper Austria. This biologically tested procedure neither results in pests developing any resistance nor poses any danger to bees, soil and groundwater. With a flight performance of about four minutes per hectare, we are able to apply the ichneumon flies packed in balls with precision and speed. These balls contain ichneumon flies in different stages of development, which hatch within two weeks and lay their eggs in the corn borer larvae. After two weeks, a second application takes place. This ensures that the corn borer is parasitized within a period of one month.

"https://www.agroinnovationlab.com/zukunft-erde-the-innovative-humus-formation-program/","AgroInnovationLab","Zukunft Erde – the innovative humus formation program","The great hope for CO2 storage lies in our agricultural and forestry soils. Organic carbon is bound in the soil in the form of humus and this has a positive effect on the CO2 content in the air. Hence, the formation of humus serves both agriculture and the climate. Together with the Lagerhaus organisation we would like to use this opportunity to work with Austrian farmers and have therefore started the humus formation program “Zukunft Erde”. Humus formation should be rewarded. “Zukunft Erde” is a new program from the Lagerhäuser and RWA Raiffeisen Ware Austria, the aim of which is to promote the formation of humus in agricultural soils. The program works on two fronts: farmers benefit from richer soil when forming humus, and the additional humus formed within the framework of the program can be converted into regional, free CO2 certificates. As these certificates can be purchased by companies that wish to become climate neutral, this is an additional incentive for farmers to form humus and, hence, an important contribution to climate protection. Numerous international initiatives, such as the recently presented “Farm-to-Fork Strategy” or the “4 Per Mille Initiative”, focus on organic carbon sequestration in soils. Together with the Lagerhäuser, farmers in Austria can use the opportunity to illustrate the positive measures for sustainable humus formation. Sustainable, humus-promoting cultivation has numerous advantages and naturally also has a positive effect on soil properties, such as the enhancement of biological activity in the soil by improving water retention and erosion control. What is humus? Humus is the name given to the fertile soil that is found in the uppermost layer of the ground. It consists of many different organic plant-based compounds (root and crop residues, root excretion) and microorganisms (microorganism excretion and dead microorganisms), which are stabilised in the soil. Humus contributes to water storage and supplying nutrients to plants and also binds in CO2. Humus is defined as organic carbon in the soil, but it is only stabilised against further decomposition if combined with the mineral soil in the form of clay-humus compounds or soil aggregates. What happens during humus formation? Carbon makes up 58% of the humus in the soil. If the humus content in the soil can be increased over the long term, more carbon will be stored, rather than entering the atmosphere as CO2. Hence, humus formation means that part of the carbon that was bound in the plant is not released again, but stored stably in the soil, especially on clay and silt surfaces and in iron oxides and soil aggregates. Build and profit with “Zukunft Erde” humus The “Zukunft Erde” program offers Austrian farmers the opportunity to benefit twice. Firstly, through increased soil activity and improved soil fertility, and secondly, in the form of financial compensation for the carbon bound in the soil. After registration (via Onfarming or in the Lagerhaus), the Lagerhaus soil sampling team takes a soil sample from a maximum of 5 ha and analyses the humus content and, if desired, other parameters. After a minimum of three years, a second sample can be taken and the humus content determined again. If humus formation has taken place – and CO2 has thus been bound in – the participant will receive financial compensation, the amount of which depends on the marketing price for CO2 certificates at that moment. One third of the payment is retained and will only be paid out after a third sampling (after a minimum of three more years) as long as the humus content has been maintained or increased further. If the humus content has fallen, this remaining payment is not made. By increasing humus growth, agriculture thus makes a significant contribution to climate and environmental protection.

November 2019 fand das erste Evergreen Innovation Camp im Format eines Hackathons an der Universität für Bodenkultur (BOKU) in Wien statt. Über 70 Studierende und Young Professionals aus ganz Österreich, Deutschland und der Schweiz arbeiteten 48 Stunden in interdisziplinären Teams an einer definierten Challenge. Zielsetzung war, innovative und ökonomisch umsetzbare Lösungen zur Nachverfolgung von Holz zu finden. Die transparente Rückverfolgung jedes einzelnen Baumstammes vom Ernteort im Wald bis zur Ankunft im Sägewerk wird für eine nachhaltige Holzversorgung und damit für die Holzindustrie immer wichtiger. Verbraucher wollen heute wissen, woher die Holzprodukte stammen. Im Rahmen des Evergreen Innovation Camps sollten konkrete Lösungsansätze gefunden werden, um die Nachvollziehbarkeit und die Transparenz der Lieferkette zu garantieren. Der Hauptpreis für die beste Lösungsidee ging an ein Team von 5 Studenten aus Österreich und wurde im Rahmen eines Abschlussevents feierlich überreicht. Anwesende Gäste waren u.a. Bundesministerin für Nachhaltigkeit und Tourismus Maria Patek, der Rektor der BOKU Wien Prof. Hubert Hasenauer sowie Vertreter führender Unternehmen und Verbände. Das Siegerteam „Tree ID“ entwickelte ein Konzept, das auf den Abgleich von Laservermessungsdaten aus dem Wald und im Werk basiert. Vor der Ernte werden die stehenden Bäume mittels Laserabtastung vermessen. Stammkontur und die Astverteilung entlang des Stammmantels sind so eindeutig, dass darauf eine Wiedererkennung möglich sein sollte. Das zweitplatzierte Team „Smeasure“ programmierte binnen 48 Stunden einen funktionierenden Prototypen dessen neuronales Netzwerk die Astverteilung bereits gefällter Bäume erkennt. Zusätzlich wird das Jahrringmuster gescannt. Um den Arbeitsablauf zu erleichtern, werden Kamera und GPS-Modul in das Maßband des Forstarbeiters integriert. Platz 3 erreichten die „Logsmiths“. Deren smarter Markierhammer bringt mit RFID-Chips versehene Plättchen auf den Stämmen an. Automatisch werden damit die GPS-Koordinaten registriert. Einzigartig beim Evergreen Innovation Camp Hackathon war die Zusammensetzung der Teams: Studierende der Forst- und Holzwirtschaft, der Informatik, Chemie, Logistik und sogar Mathematiker waren vertreten. Die Durchmischung der Fachrichtungen eröffnete ganz neue Herangehensweisen und Lösungsansätze. Damit die Teilnehmer, neben ihrem Vorwissen etwa aus der Forst- und Holzwirtschaft oder rund um die Supply Chain, Technologien wie Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence und IoT (Internet of Things) ebenso zur Lösung der Challenge einsetzen konnten, standen ihnen erfahrene Experten aus den jeweiligen Bereichen als Mentoren tatkräftig zur Seite. Über das Evergreen Innovation Camp Das Evergreen Innovation Camp ist das Nachfolgeprojekt des renommierten „Schweighofer Prize“ und wurde von der Evergreen Privatstiftung initiiert und unterstützt. Diese hat sich Förderungen im Bereich der Forst- und Holzwirtschaft (u.a. die Unterstützung von Innovation, Forschung und Entwicklung, universitäre Aus- und Weiterbildung) sowie die Unterstützung von philanthropischen Projekten zum Ziel gesetzt. Der Name „Evergreen“ soll dabei der Idee der Nachhaltigkeit und der Beständigkeit auch den entsprechenden symbolischen Ausdruck verleihen. Nach den vielversprechenden Erfahrungen mit der Premiere soll auch in 2020 ein Evergreen Innovation Camp zu einem neuen Thema veranstaltet werden. Ausrichtende Organisation und Innovationstreiber in Bezug auf die konzeptionelle und inhaltliche Gestaltung der Innovation Challenge ist die Blue Minds Group. „Österreich ist fast zur Hälfte mit Wald bedeckt. Unsere Wälder erfüllen zahlreiche Funktionen, sie stehen aber gleichzeitig vor großen Herausforderungen. Oberste Priorität ist die nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung unserer Wälder. Mit innovativen Ideen, Konzepten und neuen Ansätzen können wir Antworten auf aktuelle Fragen finden und die nachhaltige Zukunft unserer Wälder sichern.“Maria Patek, Bundesministerin für Nachhaltigkeit und Tourismus „Das Format eines Hackathons und das Zusammenwirken von Teilnehmern aus verschiedensten Studienrichtungen fördern den interdisziplinären Austausch und ermöglichen völlig neue Zugangsweisen. Wir freuen uns, dass dieses Format so gut angenommen wurde und hoffen, damit einen wertvollen Beitrag für zukünftige Entwicklungen im Bereich Forst und Holz und für die Förderung von jüngeren Generationen leisten zu können.“Georg Erlacher, Stiftungsvorstand Evergreen Privatstiftung „Die nachhaltige Verwendung von Holz aus unseren heimischen Wäldern ist ein wichtiger Beitrag zum Klimaschutz. Wir sind sehr stolz, dass das Evergreen Innovation Camp an der BOKU stattfindet, denn es passt perfekt in unsere BOKU Mission „Innovation Leader“ einer „Green Economy“ zu sein.“Hubert Hasenauer, Rektor BOKU Wien Rückfragen & Kontakt: Christina Lang, MSc Marketing Evergreen Innovation Camp Blue Minds Groupchristina.lang@blueminds-company.com OTS, 3.

Oktober 2017 zum gemeinsamen Eventabend unter dem Thema “The Future of Mobility“ in den brandneuen Start-up Hub im Sofitel Wien. Besonderer Programmpunkt war die Keynote Speech von Lior Sethon (Deputy General Manager of Aftermarket Devision Mobileye). Im Rahmen einer Panel Diskussion erörterten die Mobility-Experten Walter Kreisel (CEO Kreisel Systems), Hermann Stockinger (CEO EasE-Link) und Thomas Daiber (CEO Hubject Berlin) gemeinsam mit Lior Sethon die Fragestellung „Will humans still drive in an autonomous future?“. Durch den Abend führten Rainer Nowak (Chefredakteur Die Presse) und Alexander Hotowy (CEO accilium). Erfolgreiches Start-up aus Israel mit marktführender Technologie Im Rahmen seiner Keynote Speech präsentierte Lior Sethon spannende Entwicklungen für die Zukunft des autonomen Fahrens und gab Einblicke in aktuelle Projekte des Unternehmens Mobileye. Das israelische Start-up, welches 2017 von Intel für 15,3 Mrd. US-Dollar übernommen wurde, repräsentiert den Hauptanbieter für autonomes Fahren und ist in der Branche marktführend. Gegründet mit der Vision Autounfälle verhindern zu wollen, ist die Technologie des Unternehmens inzwischen in der Lage, Autos und relevante Verkehrsteilnehmer mit einer Präzision von 99,99 % zu erkennen und damit Verkehrsunfälle erfolgreich zu verhindern. Autonomes Fahren birgt zahlreiche Herausforderungen Sethon zufolge stellt menschliches Fahrverhalten hierbei eine der größten Herausforderungen dar. Um eine Großzahl an Unfällen vermeiden zu können, musste die Software in einem aufwendigen Verfahren lernen, „menschlich anstatt technisch korrekt zu fahren“. Ebenso war es notwendig, eine neue Form des Mappings (REM) neben der Standardtechnologie GPS zu entwickeln, da die gegenwärtige Technik unpräzise Messergebnis lieferte. Die von Mobileye entwickelte Technologie REM ermöglicht ein Erkennen anderer Verkehrsteilnehmer bis auf 10cm. Mehr Sicherheit durch After Market Solutions Neben der Entwicklung vollautomatischer Fahrzeuge präsentierte Lior Sethon ebenfalls Sekundärmarkt Lösungen, um bereits gegenwärtig Fahrzeuge mit mehr Sicherheit auszustatten. Das sogenannte „single unit“ kann in jedes Fahrzeug integriert werden und senkt durch die Abgabe von Warnhinweise die Wahrscheinlichkeit in einen Unfall verwickelt zu werden signifikant herab. Obwohl in Israel bereits 70% der Autos mit diesem Device ausgestattet wurden, sind es in Österreich aktuell noch weniger als 10%. Neue Ära durch Autonomes Fahren und E-Mobility Die Umsetzung von E-Mobility erfährt gegenwärtige einen großen Aufschwung. Walter Kreisel, CEO Kreisel Systems, erwartet eine vollständige Elektrifizierung bis zum Jahr 2030. Um dies zu ermöglichen, bedarf es jedoch der Entwicklung einer adäquaten Lade-Infrastruktur. Hermann Stockinger, CEO EasE-Link, sieht hierbei vor allem eine Thematik für die Stadtzentren. Ziel sei es, eine Infrastruktur aufzubauen, die ein Aufladen des Autos bequem beim Parken ermöglicht und dabei wirtschaftlich effizient vorgeht. Die Realisierung autonomen Fahrens ist laut Lior Sethon „keine Frage der Technik, sondern eine Frage der Restriktionen“. Autonomes Fahren würde nicht nur „die Art und Weise wie wir leben, sondern auch unsere Gesellschaft verändern – es ist keine Revolution, sondern eine neue Ära“. Jedoch ist auch die politische Unterstützung von zentraler Bedeutung, wie Thomas Daiber, CEO Hubject Berlin, betonte. Um eine neue Ära einzuläuten bedarf es zum einen mehr Courage und Vertrauen in den Wandel, zum anderen Möglichkeiten zur Deregulierung.

"https://www.inits.at/aplusb-scaleup-wirkungsanalyse-inkubation-wirkt/","INiTS","AplusB Scaleup Wirkungsanalyse: Inkubation wirkt!","Die vom Austria Wirtschaftsservice (aws) gemeinsam mit allen AplusB Scaleup Inkubatoren beauftragte Wirkungsanalyse zeigt klar und deutlich: Die Inkubations-Programme wirken und leisten wichtige Aufbauarbeit für die unternehmerische Landschaft Österreichs. Kurz zusammengefasst zeigen die soeben veröffentlichten Ergebnisse der von Joanneum Research Policies durchgeführten Studie Folgendes: AplusB Scale-up Unternehmen fördern Forschung und Innovation in diversen Märkten, sie stärken das Innovationssystem und dessen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, sie starten mit anspruchsvollen Projekten und entwickeln sich robuster und nachhaltig. Bestätigt wird diese Wirkung durch den Vergleich mit nicht inkubierten Startups: AplusB Startups schaffen mehr Beschäftigung, ihr Umsatz ist höher und ihre Überlebensrate ist größer. Auch die F & E-Intensität beträgt ein Vielfaches, rund ein Drittel der betreuten Unternehmen meldet in den ersten vier Jahren neue Patente an. Mehrwert für alle „Uns war es wichtig zu zeigen, welchen Mehrwert die AplusB Scale-up Inkubatoren sowohl für hochinnovative Gründungsprojekte als auch für die gesamte Volkswirtschaft haben. Die Ergebnisse liefern zudem Input in Sachen Verlängerung des Förderprogramms ab 2022“, fasst Mag.a Marlis Baurecht die Zielsetzung der Wirkungsanalyse zusammen. Sie ist bei der Austria Wirtschaftsservice GmbH (aws) für Entrepreneurship, Schutzrechte und Seedförderungen und damit auch für das AplusB Scale-up Programm zuständig. Hohe Überlebensrate Der steuerbare Umsatz von AplusB Scale-up Projekten entwickelt sich in den ersten zwei bis vier Jahren langsamer als in der Vergleichsgruppe, was bei stark forschungsorientierten Unternehmen in der Natur der Sache liegt. Dann starten sie aber durch und liegen ab Jahr sechs durchgehend voran, ab dem zehnten Jahr bereits um mehr als ein Drittel. In dieser Auswertung findet sich auch die weiterführende Begründung für eine nachweislich höhere Überlebensrate: Sie wird durch die gezielte Behebung unternehmerischer und individueller Defizite, durch die Konzeption von trag- und marktfähigen Businessplänen, durch Sichtbarkeit und Vernetzung und durch den professionellen Zugang zu Förderungen, Darlehen und InvestorInnen ermöglicht. Auch wenn die Auftraggeber*innen der Studie von guten Ergebnissen ausgegangen sind – so manch hoher Wert hat sogar sie positiv überrascht: „Natürlich wussten wir, dass wir mit dem Programm für die GründerInnen eine gute Basis in Sachen Beratung zur Erweiterung des Geschäftsmodells, zu Networking und Anschubfinanzierung leisten. Umso erfreulicher ist es, dass sich die Wirkung dieses Starter-Kits so deutlich unter anderem in der viel besseren Überlebensrate von inkubierten gegenüber nicht inkubierten Startups niederschlägt“, zeigt sich Marlis Baurecht erfreut. Konkret überleben rund 94 Prozent der AplusB Unternehmen das dritte Jahr ihres Bestehens, im siebten Jahr sind es rund 80 Prozent. Die nicht inkubierten Unternehmen liegen bei rund 70 bzw. 50 Prozent. „Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es z. B. im Umwelttechnologie- oder Life Sciences-Bereich eine große Menge an exzellenten und spannenden Scale-up Projekten gibt, deren Entwicklung allerdings länger dauert. Damit ist das Risiko auch höher und die Begleitung durch öffentliche Inkubatoren-Systeme sinnvoll. Denn ein privater Inkubator hat selten einen so langen Atem“, führt die aws-Expertin weiter aus. Nachhaltiger Beschäftigungseffekt „Die Impact-Studie zeigt ganz deutlich, dass das AplusB Scale-up (ABS) Programm wirkt“, sagt auch INiTS CEO Dr.in Irene Fialka und hebt besonders die erfreuliche Auswertung im Bereich der nachhaltigen Beschäftigungswirkung in Zukunftsbranchen hervor: „AplusB Scale-up Gründungsprojekte schaffen mehr Arbeitsplätze und Wien liegt in diesem Segment noch einmal voran.“ So weisen die aktiven AplusB Scale-up Unternehmen im Durchschnitt nach sechs Jahren mehr als zehn und nach zehn Jahren mehr als zwanzig unselbständig Beschäftigte auf. Im fünften Jahr ihres Bestehens haben AplusB-inkubierte Startups im österreichweiten Durchschnitt neun Mitarbeiter*innen, in Wien liegt dieser Wert sogar bei zwölf. Nicht AplusB-inkubierte Startups hingegen schaffen im gleichen Zeitraum nur knapp zwei neue Arbeitsplätze. „Ein echtes ABS-Programm!“, freut sich Irene Fialka. Im Rahmen der aktuellen Förderperiode konnte auch ein etwas höherer Beschäftigungsanteil von Frauen von 23 Prozent gegenüber zuvor von 16 Prozent erreicht werden, der Anteil der Gründerinnen stieg von zuvor 9 auf 17 Prozent an. Bereits im dritten Jahr nach der Gründung exportiert ein Drittel der AplusB Scale-up Unternehmen, in der Kontrollgruppe liegt die Exportneigung im untersuchten Fünf-Jahres-Zeitraum stets nur um zehn Prozent. Risiko minimieren Für Marlis Baurecht hängen die hohen Beschäftigungszahlen auch mit der Fokussierung auf Projekte mit höherem Entwicklungsrisiko zusammen. Denn bei solchen Startups ist auch der Innovationsgrad hoch, was bei einer guten Begleitung der Gründer*innen nach dem ersten Durchtauchen zu einem überdurchschnittlichen Wachstum führt: „Wir können diese Risiken in den ersten Monaten der Inkubation gut darstellen, steuern und in der Folge minimieren.“ Warum gerade bei riskanten, weil entwicklungsintensiven Projekten die Inkubationsprogramme so gut wirken, liegen für Marlis Baurecht – nun auch durch die Studie bestätigt – auf der Hand: „Sie unterstützen die Gründer*innen in einer sehr frühen Phase dabei, so viele Kompetenzen wie möglich im eigenen Team abzubilden. Denn je mehr Bereiche wie z. B. Technologieentwicklung und betriebswirtschaftliches Wissen schon durch das Gründungsteam abgedeckt werden, desto widerstandsfähiger ist ein Startup. Ergänzt durch erste Finanzierungen werden Innovationsschritte besser vorangetrieben, die Positionierung ist nachhaltiger, das Unternehmen krisenresistenter.“","https://www.inits.at/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beitragsbilder.048.jpeg","17.

Gemeinsam mit dem Dachverband der Österreichischen Sozialversicherungen lud der Health Hub Vienna Expertinnen und Experten, allesamt Insider des österreichischen Gesundheitswesens zum Innovation Day. Ziel war, neue Ideen und Möglichkeiten zur Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens zu diskutieren und das Whitepaper „COVID-19 – eine Chance für das Gesundheitssystem in Österreich“ vorzustellen. Die Pandemie löste eine Reihe von Innovationen und kreativen Lösungen aus – weil sie plötzlich unabdingbar waren. Viele der neuen Lösungen bewähren sich – zeigen die Notwendigkeit von Digital Health und gleichzeitig das große Potential Österreichs, aufgrund seiner einzigartigen Größe und Position im DACH-Raum führend in diesem Bereich zu sein. „Wir als Health Hub Vienna haben es uns gemeinsam mit unseren Partnern zur Aufgabe gemacht, eine treibende Kraft bei der Digitalisierung des Gesundheitssystems in Österreich und in Europa einzunehmen.“ betonte Dr. Irene Fialka, CEO INiTS & Managing Director Health Hub Vienna in ihrem Begrüßungsstatement.

Die Ergebnisse der aktuellen Impact-Studie","Marlis Baurecht, aws, Verantwortliche für das AplusB Scale-up Förderprogramm, im Gespräch mit Irene Fialka von INiTS über die Ergebnisse der AplusB Impact Studie von Jonnaneum Research.Wie die Studie zeigt, sind Startups aus den AplusB-Zentren wirtschaftlich erfolgreicher als vergleichbare Unternehmen ohne Unterstützung – so bestehen 86 Prozent der AplusB-Unternehmen nach den ersten fünf Jahren weiterhin, in der Vergleichsgruppe lediglich 58 Prozent. Die unterstützten Startups sind damit nicht nur nachhaltig erfolgreicher, sondern schaffen qualitativ hochwertige Jobs, verfügen über eine höhere Exportneigung und erzielen mehr als die Hälfte ihrer Umsätze auf internationalen Märkten. Damit bringen sie zusätzlich Wertschöpfung nach Österreich.Dieses Interview ist dem Programm des SCALEup Demo Days vom 1. Dezember 2020 entnommen, in dem sich die Startups des Inkubationsprogramms erstmals einer Jury und einem Publikum aus Investor*innen und Unternehmensvertreter*innen präsentieren.

Together with the Federation of Austrian Social Insurances, the Health Hub Vienna invited experts, all of them insiders of the Austrian health care system, to the Innovation Day. The aim was to discuss new ideas and possibilities for digitizing the healthcare system and to present the white paper “COVID-19 – an opportunity for the healthcare system in Austria”. The pandemic triggered a series of innovations and creative solutions – because they were suddenly indispensable. Many of the new solutions are proving their worth – demonstrating the necessity of Digital Health and at the same time Austria’s great potential to be a leader in this field due to its unique size and position in the DACH region. “Together with our partners, we as Health Hub Vienna have made it our mission to be a driving force in the digitization of the healthcare system in Austria and Europe”. emphasized Dr. Irene Fialka, CEO INiTS & Managing Director Health Hub Vienna in her welcoming statement. DI Martin Brunninger, MEng, MSc, CEO of the Federation of Austrian Social Insurances, pointed out in his opening remarks that “recent times have highlighted the undeniable need for digital health solutions in healthcare worldwide. There is a strong consensus that massive growth has taken place, especially in the last six months. Stakeholders believe that it is important to preserve this progress and actively create a new normality. The conditions for successful digitization were discussed on the podium by: Nora Blum, PhD, cofounder and CEO, Selfapy (virtually) Dr. Andrea Vincenzo Braga, MBA, Vice president TELEMED Austria (Austrian Association for Telemedicine), MD and Telemedicine-entrepreneur (virtually) DI Martin Brunninger, MEng, MSc, CEO Federation of Austrian Social Insurances MMag.

They work together with Novartis Oncology to optimize therapy management in a specific cancer disease. wellabe – enables people to record vital parameters, implement health check-ups and to understand and actively shape their own health. Together with Uniqa, they are bringing a mobile solution to companies to provide convenient and efficient employee health care. docdok.health – the “Netflix of healthcare” uses the potential of patient-generated data to enable and offer personalized healthcare solutions. Evidence-based and cost-efficient. Together with the Vinzenz Gruppe, they have been able to shift outpatient operations to the home and make medical care available digitally while maintaining the necessary data security.

More than ever, innovative solutions and “thinking outside the box” with a short innovation cycle are needed! The white paper highlights some already successful implementations of digital health solutions and calls for committed action to sustain the progress made. Health Hub Vienna staff conducted a series of interviews with healthcare professionals and asked them about their challenges and experiences with specific use cases of digital health solutions. The prevailing opinion is that the last six months have seen the growth of a decade and that it is important to preserve this progress and actively establish a new standard. Digital Health on the rise The COVID-19 pandemic changed healthcare in Austria and around the world dramatically in a very short period of time. The crisis required rapid changes in procedures to adapt to the measures set in place and minimize the impact of the coronavirus. Digital health technologies have played a pioneering role in this process. COVID, as a trigger, has enabled healthcare experts to gain insight into the vast possibilities of digital health solutions and address the challenges they face in practice. The role of startups The paper explores the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the role of digital health solutions in the Austrian healthcare system in nine main areas, additionally highlighting ideas related to the role of startups, the landscape of legal and regulatory frameworks, and technical infrastructure, and discussing approaches for national efforts toward a digital health innovation strategy. Ultimately, the paper calls for committed action by all decision makers to sustain and build on the progress that has been made – so that what many see as the growth of a decade is not lost. The white paper can be downloaded from the Health Hub Vienna website. ","https://www.inits.at/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Beitragsbilder.050-300x158.jpeg","2.

Weeks of planning, preparation and rehearsal lead to a highly interactive event, in which all our technology providers ended up with several contacts to further proceed.

Mehr denn je sind innovative Lösungen und ein „Denken über den Tellerrand“ mit einem kurzen Innovationszyklus gefragt! Das Whitepaper zeigt einige bereits erfolgreiche Implementierungen von digitalen Gesundheitslösungen auf und ruft zum engagierten Handeln auf, um den gemachten Fortschritt aufrechtzuerhalten. Mitarbeiter*innen des Health Hub Vienna haben eine Reihe von Interviews mit Fachleuten aus dem Gesundheitswesen geführt und sie nach ihren Herausforderungen und Erfahrungen mit spezifischen Anwendungsfällen von digitalen Gesundheitslösungen gefragt. Vorherrschende Meinung ist, dass in den letzten sechs Monaten das Wachstums eines Jahrzehnts stattgefunden hat und dass es wichtig ist, diesen Fortschritt zu bewahren und aktiv einen neuen Standard zu etablieren. Digital Health im Vormarsch Die COVID-19-Pandemie hat das Gesundheitswesen in Österreich und weltweit in sehr kurzer Zeit stark verändert. Die Krise erforderte rasche Änderungen der Abläufe, um sich an die gesetzten Maßnahmen anzupassen und die Auswirkungen des Coronavirus auf ein Minimum zu beschränken. Digital-Health-Technologien haben dabei eine Vorreiterrolle gespielt. COVID als Auslöser hat den Expert*innen im Gesundheitswesen ermöglicht, einen Einblick in die enormen Möglichkeiten von digitalen Gesundheitslösungen zu gewinnen und sich mit den Herausforderungen, die in der Praxis auftreten, auseinanderzusetzen. Die Rolle der Startups Das Papier untersucht die Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Krise auf die Rolle digitaler Gesundheitslösungen im österreichischen Gesundheitswesen in neun Hauptbereichen, darüber hinaus werden Ideen in Bezug auf die Rolle von Startups, die Landschaft der rechtlichen und regulatorischen Rahmenbedingungen und die technische Infrastruktur beleuchtet and Ansätze für nationale Bemühungen um eine Innovationsstrategie für digitale Gesundheit diskutiert. Letztendlich ruft das Papier zum engagierten Handeln aller Entscheidungsträger auf, um den erreichten Fortschritt aufrechtzuerhalten und weiter auszubauen – damit das, was viele als das Wachstum eines Jahrzehnts sehen, nicht verloren geht.

Letter from CEO Nicolai Schaettgen","2018 is gone – what to expect for 2019? We are in our 4th year, are present in >20 countries and achieved what most initially called “stupid”: to live off our business model. We are proud and thus allow ourselves to join in the sheer unlimited number of outlooks 2019. Here comes our very personal one. 2019 is dedicated to “Less is more” – Why that? We are doing too much… Opportunities are turning up and each one is eating up a few of our resources leading to a mismatch between needed and actual attention. Thereby our vision is simple: “Make startup-corporate collaboration simple and successful” – as such, we will much more diligently focus on activities leading us to that vision and – more importantly – stop activities (very painful…). Where will our bets be placed? 1. Make our existing core more efficient In 2018 we managed to significantly strengthen our team and welcome many senior resources (Attila Keszeg, Amine Tazi, Allison Amber, Daniel Heller, Alireza Abdolali, Arkadiusz Andrzejewski, Chris Morgan, Claudio Staub, Karl Rothleitner, Karl Peter Nöstler, Niko Schweitzer, Pascal Hohman, Stefanos Anastasiou, Liza Semenova, Anastasia Rastorgina, Munaa AlTamini, Francesca Montanar, Björn Schättgen). In 2019 we will focus on bringing this potential to the market: we know what needs to be done, now we need to get better at it. 2. Be more creative in the collaboration models with our startup partners All our startup partners (currently we are working with nine portfolio companies) are confirming the value which we are creating directly and indirectly. Still, we feel we can do more and bring more value to the startup world to help to navigate through the corporate jungle. We are already working on new engagement models to enable the impact of our work to spread. 3. Strengthen and reinvent the way we work with our corporate partners We have had interactions with >300 corporations in 2018 (!!!) – in reality we have done business with only a fraction of those, which means that we need to qualify better the business potential. Given where we are and where we are heading, we are looking positively into 2019. Thank you all for joining us.

Atom Bank is the first UK bank built exclusively for mobile and it is ranked the sixth leading global FinTech innovator. When talking about Atom Bank, Edward brings the parallel to the James song from 90s: “We were born of frustration and we keep that frustration close to us, as it is the way to continue reshaping. We want to be the business that never stops surprising.” This relentless desire to innovate echoed through our entire interview. How do you explain Atom Bank to an eight-year-old in maximum three sentences? Atom Bank is a brand-new bank that allows you to use your face or voice to get into your money wherever you want or whenever you want to. What are 2-3 concerns about Atom Bank’s future that keep you up at night? My children keep me up at night ???? Regarding Atom Bank, it’s three Cs: customers (doing right by them at all times), cyber threats (it really is a war out there) and capital (the lifeblood of any start up). How have you convinced your teammates to do something they were not keen to do? At Atom Bank we haven’t had to face such a situation, as our people are willing to produce very complex math calculations at one moment and help to clean up the kitchen the next. We don’t allow peoples’ roles to be defined. The best way to explain it is to bring a parallel from football world. In Dutch team, every player plays equally in all different roles. They never won the world cup, but they have entertained a lot of people. Dutch play is much more enjoyable than that of other teams where roles are very clearly defined. Which functions/areas in financial industry will not likely be replaced by FinTechs, simply due to the basic human nature and human needs? Financial sector has been through many revolutions and technology has been applied there for decades. Sector is currently attacked throughout the value chain. I believe that humans are by nature interested in innovation and that’s what leads us to progress. As such, I struggle to find any areas that shall not be transformed by FinTechs. You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What will you do with the elephant? Will grow better roses ???? What is the misconception people have about you? They might think that I’m a banker, but I’m not. I work in the bank, but am not a banker and am rightly kept away from the real process of banking. In truth I am actually a bit of a dilettante and mostly I think about what’s coming next. If you could only choose one song to be played every time you enter a room for the rest of your life. Which song would it be? Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFo8-JqzSCM) – the greatest rock and roll track ever.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/photo-1525944001263-ba59a9974f88-300x200.jpeg","14.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/firechat-5g-and-whats-it-all-about/","MatchMakerVentures","Firechat: 5G and what’s it all about","Peter Wukowits, Managing Director of Nokia, provides his view on 5G. 5G was the dominant topic at the MWC – can you explain in short what 5G is all about? 5G should not be thought of as just a new mobile technology, in the manner that we’ve seen GSM, 3G and LTE evolve, with achievement measured in terms of how long it takes to download a movie to a smartphone, or upload holiday photos. 5G will enable an entirely new array of ‘use cases’, in addition to dramatically enhancing existing wireless applications. 5G will enable new possibilities in a wide variety of commercial and industrial sectors – from manufacturing to healthcare and from transportation to utilities. And because of the range of use cases 5G can support for numerous industries, it has the potential to be a societal game changer – and an integral part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. This isn’t hype, but the realization of a technology that has the potential to support a completely connected world. The requirements for 5G technology are laid out: 5G is estimated to potentially facilitate up to one million devices per square kilometer It should have 10,000 times greater capacity than the cellular networks of 2010 Peak 5G speeds will be available from 20Gbps (with speeds everywhere of 100Mbps in the downlink and 50Mbps in the uplink) It will support everything from 0km/h all the way up to 500km/h high speed vehicular access (i.e. in the case of trains) 5G’s one-millisecond latency and ‘five nines’ (99.999%) reliability means that critical systems will be available for autonomous driving for mass transit, connected healthcare for developed and emerging markets, and will bring unique immersive experiences never before thought possible Leading telecom vendors (like Nokia) as well as various standardization bodies, research institutes, network operators have been working together very hard to be able to introduce the next step of the evolution in that domain. 5G is going to be one of the main building blocks for 4th Industrial Revolution and dense digitalization of society. At the end of the day, it will be beneficial for everyone. What will I be able to do with 5G what I can’t do today? As a consumer, you`ll be able to download very large chunks of content (like ultra-HD 360-degree videos) in a matter of minutes regardless of the device being used and where you are. Then, you`ll be able to enjoy real-time gaming on your mobile device with a significantly better experience than today, due to the vastly improved latency (up to 1ms) compared over what is now delivered by 4G networks. 5G will play an important role in connected/autonomous driving, again due to unique low latency capabilities – Nokia is currently testing a number of applications of this with partners. 5G enables the seamless interaction between robots and humans which is – again – highly sensitive to latency. Last, but not least, it will enable so-called ‘network slicing’, which means that a number of different applications with completely different requirements can run on the same physical network infrastructure at the same time. This will allow network operators to distribute ‘slices’ of their network, each one tailored to the unique needs of their customers, for example a slice with extremely low latency for hospital and medical type of applications, a slice with high security parameters for banking, a slice with ultra-high capacity for a stadium during popular concert or football game and so on. This will allow many different use cases and business models and improve end user experience. What are the specific challenges attached to 5G? The technology is still under standardization, but this will be resolved in nearest future. Now, we need to work on the use cases for various industry segments. We must think beyond traditional silos and take an ecosystem approach. This is key for later adoption and we have a lot of trials and other activities going on with companies across sectors. But to ensure timely deployments of 5G infrastructures and services, policy frameworks must be adapted and be ‘5G ready’. In this context, there are three priorities for policy makers: Making more spectrum available: accelerating spectrum identification and allocation to mobile broadband is critical, as well as ensuring the appropriate rulings in those spectrum bands. Modernizing rules to incentivize and facilitate the deployment of telecom infrastructure: in this context, replicability of processes and simplification of installation regimes for small cells can help dramatically decrease deployment timelines and costs. Ensuring new business models and services can flourish: here’s where balanced net neutrality rules are critical, allowing ‘quality of service’ differentiation. While preserving the principles of the open internet, differentiating network traffic is important as users require higher speeds and lower latency connectivity for specific usages (network slices). In addition, cross border free flow of data is essential to incentivize and scale cloud based services. Regarding data-protection and security, a delicate balance must be found to effectively protect end-users while enabling new digital services. Globally, who is leading and where does Europe stand in 5G? At a global level, Nokia sees China, the United States, South Korea and Japan as taking a strong lead in making 5G happen. For example, 5G technology was trialled during the recent winter sports event in South Korea. In general, Nokia sees the first commercial 5G network launches starting in 2019 – a year earlier than previously suggested, and it’s possible that there may even be first 5G services starting in 2018, especially amongst US operators. These are not expected to be full, nationwide launches, but selective evolutions of networks with 5G air links. Europe is a somewhat different place, where technology launches requiring regulatory alignment can happen at a different speed to other regions. However, it is recognized at EU level that 5G technology is an opportunity for Europe to regain technological leadership and increase competition, with all market players – operators, regulators, vendors and customers working together very closely, not an easy task in such a fragmented market. When will 5G be commercially relevant? We see large-scale commercial rollouts of 5G services by 2020, with standardization in place, and chipset and device manufacturers producing a variety of 5G-capable devices in volume. What do you recommend any MNO today? The pace of 5G development is running very fast. All operators are forming their 5G plans and implementation strategies, looking at their respective markets and what their competitors may do. Being a pioneer in new technologies and services has its challenges, bringing 5G to market will have financial and operational challenges for service providers. But fortune favors the brave and with 5G, MNOs will have a unique opportunity to change their market position, as was done in the past with 4G.

Now with over 1,500 employees, the San Francisco-based company has branched out into mortgages, personal loans, investing and banking—all with a digital-first approach. The Challenge SoFi was not aware of a technical issue on their website causing an increase in incomplete loan applications and was blind to the magnitude of the phenomenon. In fact, the issue went completely under their radar until Glassbox started to capture and visualize all of their user sessions. The Solution With Glassbox’s tag-less deployment, SoFi was capturing 100% of sessions and all events and elements, including user activity and technical elements occurring behind the scenes. Root-casue analysis sped by real-time anomaly detection and alerts Glassbox’s anomaly detection engine, based on machine learning, alerted the SoFi team to 546 sessions in a one-week period in which users received an error message and never completed their loan application. Measuring the revenue impact with Cashbox SoFi leveraged the Cashbox dashboard in Glassbox to capture the value of the user input in the loan application form. The team was able to aggregate all loan applications and track the following insights: Average loan value Monthly loan value Average monthly loan value Geolocation OS/Browser/ISP By recognizing and understanding the full scope of the problem and true monetary impact of this technical error, the business team and the IT team flagged this issue as a top priority. By sharing session replays of the affected sessions with the production support team, the root cause of error was identified and fixed within the same day. The Main Results If the glitch had continued to go unnoticed, the failed sessions would add up to over 28,000 abandoned applications annually. With an average success rate of 38.2%, it was estimated this error could have caused a loss of 10,845 loan deals. Based on a hypothetical monthly loan value of $900 per loan (the actual loan value has been changed for demonstration purposes), SoFi prevented a potential annual loss of over $9 million by fixing this error. ""Glassbox gives us the most accurate view of how our members experience our app and saves us countless time on squashing bugs, finding friction, and gives us confidence in how we plan our UX roadmap.""

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/id-theft-insights-from-industry-expert-daniel-soederberg/","MatchMakerVentures","Identity theft: Insights from industry expert Daniel Söderberg","One can practically steal your life. The ever-rising threat of identity theft is tough reality. ID theft happened once every 2 seconds in 2017. You are more likely to have your identity stolen than your car taken or home burglarized. We got together with Daniel Soederberg, CEO of EyeOnID, a company that provides an out-of-box solution for proactive identity theft protection, to understand the truths behind identity theft and get first-hand professional advice on how to protect ourselves from the bad actors. What is ID theft? ID theft (to make it simple) is when someone else is using your identity to do something. It could be malicious (=bad) or not that harmful (someone writing a post on your Facebook account when you forgot to logout on a public computer). In other words, identity theft is when someone else is acting under your identity, doesn’t matter if it’s harmful or not. Why can it be so threatful? Because you can do so much with it. Someone can go out there and act totally as if they are you: they can create a fake passport, take loans in your name, open up bank accounts in your name, create digital accounts on various sites and services, they can use your information go to the hospital (especially in the US) and get the medical bills sent to you, or even create a criminal record on you. In the worst-case scenario one can practically steal your whole life. Who are the primary targets of ID theft? Historically the threat actors in many cases acted on men in the age group of 25-55 as it was easier to get their information and they usually had most money. That has changed. Nowadays everyone is a potential victim: men, women, older, younger. The threat actors have found other ways of how they can profit from stolen identities. Younger generations are a perfect target for digital services accounts (e.g. Netflix, Steam, Spotify) and taking loans. Older generations tend to not actively monitor their bank account activity. They also tend to have a higher trust for people, for example if someone says that they are calling from the bank with malicious intention and are less suspicious. Meanwhile, children are the most unprotected generation as the industry is not there yet to ensure preventive measures. What implications does it have? Depends on the damage. If someone took over a teenager’s Facebook account – it happens. If in addition nude pictures of that person were posted and the whole school saw them – the psychological damage is unavoidable. For older generations, if a credit card gets stolen, the bank issues a new card and, in most cases, gives back the money. The trend we are starting to see though, is that banks have started to question customer fraud claims and, in some cases, refused to cover for lost money. How do the bad actors choose their targets? There are two sides of the coin: malicious actors targeting specific individuals or target groups and those that go wide. For this example, let’s say that Facebook has been attacked and the hackers got a hold of 50 million users sensitive data. The malicious actors targeting specific groups have a wide range of ways to decide who and how they want to act. For instance, if the chat information was part of the leak they could easily filter out credit card information. They could also structure all the data in a database and use that to create specific target groups: Gender, Age group, Civil status, Country, Occupation, Interest, Joined groups, Mail address, Phone number, etc. From that information the malicious actor can create tailored phishing emails with the aim to get a hold of additional sensitive information or why not a ransomware. Malicious actors going for a wider alternative will most probably go for a Credential Stuffing Attack. The aim of the attack is to test the leaked credentials (username and password) from the breach against other websites and services in order to gain access to them. In this example the malicious actor will automatically test 50 million usernames and passwords against companies like Netflix, Uber, Spotify, Gmail, Steam but also smaller companies who do not have as high security standard. The sophisticated tools that today is being used in attacks like these can almost mimic a human behavior making it harder to detect. Whenever they get access to a new site they will store that information in order to either sell, share or use it for additional malicious actions. Due to the fact that users in 80% of the cases are reusing one or several passwords it is easy to understand this is a popular method among malicious actors. It is so popular that 43% of all login attempts are done by bots. On darknet you will find loads of sites selling various logins to sites like Netflix – you can buy a subscription for a lifetime, and whenever the current user account gets blocked, they will send you a new stolen one. How bad is it when your credit card gets stolen? When your credit card is stolen, it is more like a bump on the road – a week or two until things are solved, you get a new card and money back from your bank. Your credit card is an arm length away from you. Your social security number (SSN), on the other hand, is like a ring around you, tied very close. So, it’s always worse when bad actors go for other parts of your identity. The effect of an identity breach is for life – you cannot change your personal ID in many countries. Identity theft can go on for years. In the majority of identity theft cases, a bad actor can exploit you for as long as they can make money off you. Once you block them with proactive services combined with reactive services, they will stop and move on to their next victim. There will be no reason for them to continue and the risks of getting caught will increase. What about when your email as a username together with a password has been part of a breach? This is the most common type of leaked information, we are talking about billions of credentials circulating. First of all when notified you’d need to change passwords on all the websites you registered with your email, and it’s a lot to remember. Rule of thumb, always remember the 5-10 accounts you have with the most sensitive information about you and start with them. Most people have 2 private emails: one they use for regular sites and one for ‘crappy’ sites. The problem though is that we are lazy and for that reason we reuse our passwords on all different usernames (emails) we have for various sites including our email for work. Finding out other emails connected to you as an individual is in many cases easy. With everything being connected to the internet, we are looking not just at identity theft, but privacy theft. The ring around you is getting bigger: your IP number will be more and more critical, tied to you via IoT devices: your refrigerator, TV or vacuum cleaner will have your private information. We are inclining towards using the term ‘privacy protection’ instead of ‘identity protection’ as the next step. What are the steps to take if you fall victim of ID theft? If you are a victim, using ID monitoring will give you an idea of where your information have and is going. If you don’t have an assistant service, you need to be proactive yourself. Inform the police, notify banks and credit bureaus Start with a police report as it is needed for insurance claims. Step two is calling the credit bureaus – put a block on your name if possible (various from country to country), preventing bad actors from taking loans and affecting your credit score. Talk to the bank directly to have this information in the log book and check your account status for any suspicious transactions. If you have an ID-Theft insurance, you should naturally call them first for guidance. Advice: keep big sums on your savings account, minimize your amounts on the transactional account to minimize damage. Block your credit card if you see any fraudulent transactions. Check your mailbox The loan papers are often sent to your mailbox at home, so make sure you have a lock on it. Sometimes the bad actor can wait for the mailman, take your post and sign for it in your name. Keep track of all the post that is coming: act immediately upon receiving any confirmation for activities you did not do. Protect your email account Change your logins for mail accounts – it’s extremely important. Bad actors will download everything off your email box and work through it to find sensitive data: anything from a photo of your credit card to private information from family members. Remember: do not reuse your password, do not give out more information than is needed, do not be so trustworthy with information! Think of it like this: businesses want to collect as much information about you as they can, in order to make money. You may not give it out knowingly, yet you have agreed to all their terms and conditions. GDPR states: service providers shouldn’t take more information than is necessary to provide a service. However, it is not always being followed. The internet is the worst place – just by accessing a site you give out your information, such as your IP number. We are foreseeing a big shift: your IP number/numbers will have a higher value than your Social Security Number (SSN) as it will be tied up to more places. Think of the internet the way you act in your normal life: you wouldn’t give out all information about yourself when going grocery shopping. If you intend to be anonymous, you can pay cash. When you buy food online, you give out your name, phone number, address, password, email etc. Understand that the online store will track everything you do on their site and enrich your data with the analytic result (buying behavior, when you buy, what you eat, for how many people, trending brands etc etc) – in many cases sensitive information about you that attackers can use. Ask yourself: what would I have done in the analogue world? How can EyeOnID help? EyeOnID have created what we call EyeOnID 360° Modules. These modules are created for creating a 360° protection around our Identity/Privacy. Monitoring ID-Monitoring is one part. We cover the digital part by creating proactive 360° Modules/services. As an example, the ID-Monitoring Module is like a filter that warns you when your information has been part of a leak that is being spread on the Internet or Darknet. We create higher awareness of users by doing risk scoring and by the Module password check we make sure users are not reusing the passwords that have been part of a previous breach. The higher the awareness, the less likely a user will become a victim. Support & Assistance Secondly, we provide Support and Assistant services that customers can always consult to prevent the attacks or ask for proactive advice after it happened. It is the support service they can always call if they are worried about something, get tips and advice on how to act or get explanations on warnings and notifications they have received from the proactive modules, like ID-Monitoring. If they would fall victim, the Assistance service is there to hold their hand, to lead them through various steps, block what happened and prevent more things from happening. Insurance Finally, we provide the insurance to cover the costs that might occur – anything from having to stay home from work, legal aid, court costs etc. The proactive digital 360° Modules are like a fishing net, we will catch a large number of fishes (threats) in the net but if a fish swings by, we will catch it at the assistance service. Otherwise, we pick it up at the insurance part. These are the three steps to help you as a consumer.

They have been among the first to introduce corporate accelerators, launch corporate venture capital arms, and introduce a variety of corresponding managerial roles. However, realizing value from these innovation efforts have proved elusive. Today, professional investors shy away from start-ups whose business models build on telco collaboration, focusing instead on those disrupting the slow-moving giants. To gauge the state of affairs, Match-Maker Ventures, Arthur D. Little and the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley launched a truly global study including views from ecosystem influencers drawn from corporates, start-ups and investors, with telco industry respondents covering about 82% of global telecom revenues. The results expose the increasing divide across stakeholders: Telecom operators have furthered their open innovation efforts but face headwinds to achieve meaningful scale or realize value. On the other hand, start-ups and start-up-like entities continue to shun telecom operators as partners of choice. We trust this study will bring you up to speed on the innovation quest for telecom operators and spurs you to revisit current efforts within your organization.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-alberto-onetti/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Alberto Onetti (Mind the Bridge and Startup Europe Partnership)","Learnings from Europe’s collaboration forerunner We had the pleasure to speak to Alberto Onetti about Silicon Valley, the European startup vision and the “elephants” we still need to move in Europe. Alberto is one of the key players of the European corporate-startup ecosystem as Chairman of Mind the Bridge and coordinator of the Startup Europe Partnership. Alberto supports the European way for startups, which is starting to produce results, but is still far from over: “We are only at the beginning!” Just as proud as Alberto is about everything he has done so far, including all his mistakes (although we doubt there were many…), we are proud that Alberto took the time to talk with us. We are looking forward to intensifying our collaboration with Startup Europe Partnership and Mind the Bridge in the months and years to come. Can you provide us with a brief overview of how your startup engagement started? Mind the Bridge was founded in 2007 with the idea of creating a bridge between Italy and Silicon Valley and the ultimate goal to foster entrepreneurship and startups in Italy. Along the years, we have been asked to replicate our model in other countries and so we started our international growth. We currently pursue two main objectives: (1) We support corporates trying to get involved in the startup ecosystem and (2) we are working to create a stronger and richer startup ecosystem in Europe. Startup Europe Partnership is creating more and more awareness. What is your role and what has been achieved to date? The European Commission launched two main initiatives to foster startup-corporate collaboration at WEF in Davos in January 2014. We have been asked to take the lead in one of the two, called Startup Europe Partnership (SEP). The task was to launch the first pan-European open innovation platform, creating a bridge between startups and corporates. Since then, we have organized more than 20 matching events involving 40+ corporates and 400+ startups and we are aware of 15 deals already being closed directly through our scouting and matching activities. Knowing how many hurdles startups still face today, I can hardly imagine the situation 10 years ago. How did the ecosystem change from your perspective? No comparison is possible; it was a different geological era. When we started, the European startup ecosystem was still in its infancy. Today startups are all over Europe – in every country and city – that is a “shocking” difference! All this is certainly very positive, but it is just the beginning. If we look at scaleups (startups that are able to grow and produce revenue and employment) the number is very limited. Based on our research, there are probably not more than a thousand in Europe. Not enough. But this small number is a direct consequence of the normal lifecycle of everything. The Venture Capital industry started to take off in the ‘70s in Silicon Valley, in the ‘90s in New York and around ’05-’10 in the UK. The German VC industry started just a few years ago and in Southern and Eastern Europe the venture capital game is about to start now. Things take time to mature and produce results, i.e. scaleups. If you look at the European startup vision, one can almost identify two different paths: (A) Trying to copy as much as possible from Silicon Valley, bundle resources and create a European SV or (B) leverage the diversity of Europe and essentially follow a fragmentation strategy. Although black-and-white, where are we leaning towards? Competing with SV is certainly a losing game. The difference is simply too big. SV is and will remain the only startup cluster in the world without a clear specialization. Europe is very different. We have many small hubs from London to Germany, from France to the Nordics. More and more hotspots are coming up as we speak (look at Lisbon). Europe by definition is diverse, that’s what we need to build on. If you look back, what are you most proud of and what would you have done differently? I am proud of everything I have done. This explicitly includes all my mistakes, which have been numerous. In terms of achievements, creating the Startup Europe Partnership as the European open innovation hub and subsequently putting the topic of startup-corporate collaboration high on many people’s agenda, incl. the European Commission (see the recent Scale-up Manifesto), has been quite a challenge. Similarly launching the first official European mission to Silicon Valley (SEC2SV – Startup Europe Comes to Silicon Valley) with the goal to initiate a high level dialogue between European and US corporates, investors and policy makers is something a lot of people give us some credit for. But certainly, there is huge room for improvements. Identifying the most effective forms of startup-corporate collaboration, involving more corporates, in particular mid-size corporates – the true backbone of European economy – is crucial. Looking at 2017 – What do you expect? Is there a tech bubble ongoing? That’s a good question, but I would not speak about a bubble as such. When you are in the Valley, there certainly is the perception that things heated up too much. Europe is different, I have not seen a similar sentiment (at least not yet). Still, we are all taking too many “startup drugs” and we need to get a little sober. Although we haven’t got a proper hangover, I start having a bit of a headache.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/photo-1521452864218-156416da8db3-300x200.jpeg","14.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-chris-morgan/","MatchMakerVentures","New era of digital media: Programmatic & Corp-Up. Interview with Chris Morgan","Digital is here. But what’s next? Originally from England, Chris Morgan dived into the media industry straight out of Oxford’s PPE* degree. Having started his career at BBC Magazines division, he progressed to Publicitas to launch his career in international media. Currently, he is at the forefront of the digital world with a cutting-edge tech startup Sentifi. With decades of media experience and as a witness to the first phase of the digital media era, our Match-Maker and media industry expert sat down with us to share his insights. *Philosophy, Politics and Economics You recently rediscovered yourself in the startup landscape. What was your career journey? I was in at the start of the digital era, or Digital 1.0, which was quite a difficult time to be in media because of the crash that happened around 2000. It was a difficult time for media companies trying to understand what the dynamics of the digital media landscape would be, and then they had this terrible experience with the first crash. My career became 100% digitally focused after 2007, so I lived through that print to digital transformation and helped Publicitas to go through that transformation process. I’ve had a corporate background up until this year, and after Publicitas shut down in most European markets, including Switzerland where I have been based since 2010, that was my springboard to get serious about the startup world. Working with Match-Maker Ventures since May and joining Sentifi – a media and finance tech startup – in October became my launch pad into the startup world. How has the media industry transformed? When I started my career, print was still a dominant sector of the overall media spending in the media landscape. The key change I’ve seen in the digital landscape has been ‘programmatic’. I first started reading and learning about ad networks and ad exchanges around 2010. Programmatic is more than mainstream now, accounting for up to 80% of ad spend in selected countries in Europe. It was incredible to witness the start of programmatic industry. To me it’s the most dramatic driver of change in the business, hand in hand with the emphasis on buying audience and using data to drive marketing decisions. The industry moved from focusing on context and media environment as a proxy for audience, to a conversation only about audience – meaning data-driven marketing and using data to buy audiences. Now we are coming full circle, understanding that both data-driven media buying and premium contextual environment are extremely important for ensuring brand safety. We realised the need to better understand the context of where the message is delivered and to whom it’s delivered. How is the startup scene within the digital marketing industry? I think it’s extremely dynamic. Not to discourage anyone from getting involved in startups, but it’s also extremely difficult to be successful. I’ve seen how hard it is to make a living out of it and differentiate oneself. The startup scene is full of driven, intelligent and fun people but it’s very challenging to find that positioning in the marketplace where you can shine without a hundred other people doing the same thing as you are. The startup village at DMEXCO was my recent experience of digital startups and a great signal that there are still a lot of interesting new players coming into this competitive landscape. In other words, the potential is huge yet being successful in this industry is very hard? You either have to have something very distinctive about your business model, or something special about your particular asset… Or maybe there’s a barrier to entry for other players? So it’s very difficult to make that space for yourself when there are many other startups doing something similar or pushing the same agenda as you’re pushing. It’s very dynamic and there’s a lot at stake – the digital advertising market is so big and there’s a lot to play for. But differentiating yourself is very hard because everyone wants a piece of the pie. That’s why you need the support of organisations like Match-Maker Ventures to help startups reach out to corporate partners and customers. What was your key takeaway from DMEXCO? What an enormous player Amazon advertising quickly became. I can see companies growing up around the Amazon advertising platform, facilitating access to it and helping businesses to take advantage of the power of Amazon’s advertising offer. It will hopefully spawn a very strong startup scene around it when it becomes more mature and when SMEs start to take notice of it. What developments do you foresee in the startup scene? It very difficult to predict what will come through in the next 5-10 years. My gut feeling is that we will be talking about ‘programmatic everything’, and will be calling it ‘digital marketing’ with the assumption that it is driven by automated systems in the background. I was recently reading an article that said that the next step for digital is not about IoT (Internet of Things) and voice, it’s actually about audio – programmatic radio and audio advertising. A few weeks ago, at the Programmatic Advertising Day in Switzerland, I heard an interesting presentation from Splicky, which is a DSP capable of managing programmatic out-of-home media buying. What about FAANG*’s market domination? There is no reason to think that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix won’t be huge dominant forces also in the future. Probably the dynamics and legislative landscape around these companies will change because of the recent controversies that we’ve seen which caused reputation damage at least… These companies became huge so fast, they are bound to have issues, such as how they manage personal data. It doesn’t mean that it will existentially threaten these giant American players, but we’ll have to keep a careful eye on how those big platforms develop and how consumers use them in the future. *Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google Your professional path led you to Sentifi. What is special about this startup? Sentifi is a very interesting company in my mind – I see it somehow as a synthesis of some of these trends that we’ve talked about. Sentifi uses cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to solve the problem of how to make sense of enormous quantities of data generated around the subject of financial services and financial assets. That’s a great example of how cutting-edge technologies can transform both our business and personal lives and help make sense of that crowded data landscape. What Sentifi does, it taps into the context trend: it makes sense of data and resurfaces that data in a premium environment and a premium context. It also helps you contextualise that data around the subjects that are happening in the world. It’s about premium media, finding the right audience, driving utility to users, helping investors and financial decision-makers to make sense of that cloud of data that surrounds these topics. How do you see your Match-Maker role at Match-Maker Ventures? I think the Match-Maker model is very interesting. I like the Corp-Up model. As someone in my previous role who tried to drive innovation from within the corporate, I’ve seen how difficult it is. To my mind, the Match-Maker model can be very helpful to those companies that are struggling with innovation. This idea of bringing together the best of the startup world with corporates who are looking to innovate but don’t necessarily have the internal capabilities to do so – I’ve lived it from the other side and have seen how useful it could’ve been to have a company like Match-Maker Ventures in the mix to drive corporate innovation. For some of these companies in the media branch, it’s ‘innovate or die’ – which is why Match-Maker Ventures can be such a powerful partner for them.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/acoustic-amplifier-artist-114820-300x200.jpg","3.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-erik-pfannmoller/","MatchMakerVentures","Customer service & chatbots: Interview with Erik Pfannmöller, Solvemate","We invited Erik Pfannmöller, CEO / Founder of Solvemate as a guest speaker to give his view on the importance of customer experience and chatbots in customer service improvement. Solvemate provides a cutting-edge and proven platform to automate customer support based on deep-learning and chatbot technology. How did you come up with the chatbot startup idea? Prior to founding Solvemate I was leading an e-commerce company as founder and CEO. We had 15 customer service agents dealing with 250.000 service requests per year and I noticed three problems: 1) customer satisfaction dropped dramatically as waiting times increased, 2) turn-over in the customer support team was higher than any other department, due to the repetitiveness of their work, and 3) it was too expensive to do anything about it. I am a big math nerd and have always found machine learning exciting. Now I saw a real case for building a company to solve a massive problem. What main challenges do organisations face in customer support nowadays? In addition to the above mentioned steady pressure to bring down costs for customer support while maintaining a high quality, big corporates face the digitalization issue. In big call centers we have seen technology that is 5-10 years old which just is not (yet) compatible with lightweight Software-as-a-Service solutions like Solvemate. There is technical debt existing, that needs to be tackled. Today, in the customer service industry, we are in the era of solutions based on chatbots, deep learning and AI, will this continue or what’s next? Yes, this development will continue. Our whole society is moving towards an “instant economy”, which means that we want all product and services available whenever, wherever and in real-time. This trend will continue and chatbots will be a solution to make customer support instant and affordable. What are the reasons any organisation should invest in their customer service approach and infrastructure? And any do’s and don’ts you would like to recommend? Invest: Increased satisfaction leads to more loyal customers that buy more. Transform your service agents into consultants and give their work renewed meaning. Do’s / don’ts: DO think about the customer and what they want to achieve – finding a solution to their problem as soon as possible. DO NOT force customers down one path. People have different preferences and some people will still choose to wait 10min for someone to pick up the phone over solving the problem in 12seconds with a chatbot. Customers will learn and preferences will change. Looking at your experience in building startups, which main barriers do you recon still exist between startups and corporations? Moving fast in startups vs slow decision making in corporates. In addition to that, we sometimes see that corporates expect significant results without the clear willingness to invest into Proof of Concepts. Can you share specific success stories from your partnerships with corporations? On www.solvemate.com/customers you can find a selection of customer success stories. One we did with one of the leading German Banks – Sparkasse. Find it at www.solvemate.com/sparkasse. You have recently entered a strategic partnership with MMV. What were the reasons and what do you expect as a result from that? MMV brings with it a unique network of well seasoned industry professionals, with deep network into our target markets. This type of people are not possible for a startup to hire, so partnering with MMV will enable us to open more doors in a shorter amount of time, than we would on our own.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-mario-mayerthaler/","MatchMakerVentures","Corp-up in Telecom: Interview with Mario Mayerthaler, A1 Group","An insider view on corporate-startup collaboration. We invited Mario Mayerthaler, Head of A1 Group Innovation Telekom Austria, as a guest speaker to outline how A1 is approaching the startup opportunity and what lessons were learned. A1 is actively engaging with startups through its Startup Campus, as well as directly through its different business units. Why does A1 collaborate with startups? As a leading telco in its footprint, A1 is the pacemaker in terms of digitalization for B2B and B2C. Digitalization itself opens up new possibilities and we want to create the ecosystem together with startups. We see that startups are going into verticals in which we are not present, or that startups extend the value chain in verticals in which we are. As such, we are trying to create value together, offering different models of collaboration between startups and us as group. We are searching for innovation, revenues and spirit, and we are very happy with the developments. What do you point out as the key success factors for corporations wanting to maximize impact from startup collaboration? From my perspective, it is quite simple: Expectation Management: Promise only what you can deliver. It is absolute useless to promise guidelines and deals that will not come to the ground. Be honest: Some things in a big corporate take time, but as a corporate you really have to make it happen Secure your backing: If you are responsible for cooperation with startups, secure your backing and your guidance…and use it! Which main barriers still exist between startups and corporations? Most startups believe (and they must believe) that their products are the best in the world, so it must be quite easy for corporates to sell these products. But it is not. Corporates have quite high margins on their core products, and are driven by revenue goals in core business – this makes the selling of 3rd party products difficult. On the other side, corporates often do not understand that those 3rd party products can secure their core revenues in the future. This can happen because, for customers, the additional value added from a 3rd party product might make the difference between a commodity and real value. In general, of course, the way of thinking is different in itself: startups are eager and fast, corporates are slower but structured and process-oriented. These are two different worlds and that makes it all so interesting. Can you share specific success stories from A1 in your engagement with Startups? I would take out two real success stories: Parkbob Parkbob digitalizes cities, meaning that they create an on-street inventory of parking rules and restrictions. So at the moment they know, in 40 cities in Europe and in the US, where you are allowed to park and where not, where you need to pay for parking and where not, etc. They are the only ones who have this inventory, and the interest from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers is quite high. This year, Parkbob will increase the number of digitalized cities to 100, because they have a unique technology enabling them to do that super fast. Ready2Order R2O created a best-in-class cash registry solution for all operating systems, available through a subscription model on mobile, desktop and tablet. They are a market leader in Austria and are now heading to Germany. Last year they made EUR 2,6 Mio worth of revenues, and their team is composed by 45 FTE – all that only 3 years after founding! We are really proud of that development as now we are truly picking up the pace and, due do legal restrictions, there is everywhere in Europe a need for such solutions. Overall, we see that our program is working out quite well, as all the startups have investors and growing KPIs.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photo-1482747029550-096ad6aa9caf-300x200.jpeg","29.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-maxime-bayen/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Maxime Bayen (GSMA)","Learnings from the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Programme. Being only over a year and a half old, the Ecosystem Accelerator Programme has established a lot. They successfully educate the market about the benefits of partnerships between operators and innovators and just announced the first nine startups, that have been selected for their innovation fund. During our interview and the time, we spent with Maxime and his team working on our joint report “Opening Doors”, we could feel their passion for fostering startup-corporate collaboration and their excitement for innovative ideas in the mobile services space. We enjoyed working together and look forward to fruitful collaboration between Match-Maker Ventures and the GSMA in the months and years to come. Can you provide us with a brief overview of what Ecosystem Accelerator Programme is and what is the mission of the programme? GSMA is an organisation representing the interests of mobile operators worldwide, uniting nearly 800 operators with almost 300 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The Ecosystem Accelerator programme was launched in early 2016 by the GSMA with the objective to scale innovative and sustainable mobile services in emerging markets through partnerships between mobile operators and start-ups. Today in emerging markets, mobile operators have reached the scale that start-ups lack, while start-ups have the local innovation mobile operators need. The Ecosystem Accelerator Programme is aiming to scale innovative and sustainable mobile services in emerging market through partnerships between operators and innovators. What is your role and what has been achieved to date? The GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator works to bridge the gap between operators and innovators, enabling strong partnerships that support the growth of commercially sustainable mobile products and services. We are doing this mainly through two initiatives. Firstly, knowledge sharing and advocacy to educate both parties on the benefits of these partnerships and the best approach to make them successful (see our latest insight here). Secondly, an Innovation fund that provides selected start-ups in Africa and Asia with grant funding, technical assistance, and the opportunity to partner with mobile operators in their markets, to help scale their products and services into sustainable businesses with positive socio-economic impact. We have actually just announced the first nine start-ups selected by our Innovation Fund. Why does it need external help to foster startup-corporate collaboration? In the specific case of collaboration between mobile operators and start-ups in emerging markets, while some collaborations have already taken place successfully and without external help (recent examples include Eneza and Safaricom in Kenya or WowBox and Telenor in Bangladesh), engaging and setting up these partnerships remains a complicated journey for both sides. The differences in terms of culture, organisation, execution speed and expectations are tremendous between mobile operators and start-ups. Although we are convinced that this journey will become easier on both sides as a number of mobile operators are gearing up to set up clear processes and allocate staff and budget to it, in the meantime we are trying – at our scale – to enable and facilitate this journey. If you look at mobile operators in emerging markets, what are the key challenges for start-ups to successfully collaborate with MNOs and how does this differ to more advanced markets? This is what we dive into in our latest insight co-authored with Match Maker Ventures (Opening Doors: A Start-Up’s Guide to Working With Mobile Operators in Emerging Markets). There are four main challenges alongside the four steps of this engagement and collaboration journey: (1) Start-ups might not be familiar with the trends, challenges and needs of the mobile industry and the mobile operators, (2) It is difficult for start-ups to find out within their country, and their market, which mobile operator to engage with and which person(s) at this operator to reach out to. (3) Pitching to a mobile operator remains a very different exercise than pitching to an investor (which start-ups are usually more familiar with). (4) Setting up a collaboration with a mobile operator and steering it requires a lot of effort and dedication from the start-up’s side. Once again, this is even more the case in emerging markets as those collaborations are still quite rare and hence start-ups might find themselves in a situation where they are the first start-up working on setting up a partnership with a given mobile operator. Likewise what are the key challenges for MNOs? The situations vary quite significantly from one mobile operator to another depending on whether or not the collaboration with local start-ups is a key topic on the top management agenda. Today most mobile operators in emerging markets we are talking to are keen to work with local start-ups. However, they are all at different stages when it comes to turning this willingness into a reality. One critical challenge to overcome is accepting that working with local start-ups is risky and might only pay off in the long term, while mobile operators are under quarterly commercial pressure. Beyond this initial top management buy-in, challenges like human resources and know-how, but also difficulties in sourcing the right start-ups, are making this journey harder. Looking at start-ups that were selected in the first round of the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund, what are the three factors that make you believe it would be a good match with a mobile operator? As was highlighted recently by a mobile operator in a panel that we hosted at Africa Tech Summit London, it is difficult for a mobile operator to work with a start-up at pre-revenue stage. This is why one of the criteria for start-ups to be eligible in the Innovation Fund is revenue: they need to be already generating revenue. A second and critical point we look at is how the start-ups are using mobile technology in their core activity (mobile application but also USSD, SMS, IoT etc.). Lastly, one key question we ask start-ups to answer when they apply to the fund online is about the kind of collaboration they foresee having with local mobile operators, what would they need from them and why it would make sense for mobile operators to collaborate. If you think back, what are you most proud of and what would you have done differently to help start-ups and mobile operators to work together? With the programme being just over a year and a half old, when we look back only a little bit, there was initially nothing at all. So we are quite excited that in such a short time we have been able to put this programme and its team together. One of the things we want to improve on is the traction the Innovation Fund got in Asia. Close to 70% of the 400+ applications we received during the first round of the innovation came from African start-ups and 30% from Asian entrepreneurs. While this is great as this shows the dynamism of the African tech ecosystem, we are working hard now to encourage more start-ups from emerging markets in Asia to apply. For the second round of the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund, what do you expect? For the second edition, it was decided to keep the criteria as they were for the first one, specifically when it comes to the two innovation focus areas. As it was the case for the first round we will be supporting start-ups in two innovation focus areas: the Sharing economy and Services for SMEs.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/photo-1523240795612-9a054b0db644-300x200.jpeg","10.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-monika-kuschewsk/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Monika Kuschewsky (Squire Patton Boggs)","An expert opinion on GDPR – MMV talked to Monika Kuschewsky. Monika Kuschewsky is partner in the global Data Privacy and Cybersecurity practice at Squire Patton Boggs. With over 15 years of experience in data protection, she now concentrates on GDPR with a special focus on topics like IoT, “Bring Your Own Device”-policies, international data transfers as well as customer and employee data protection. We had the pleasure to talk to her about her views on GDPR readiness of companies around the globe and why GDPR is not the end of data monetization. From your perspective as partner in a global law firm, what will be the implications of GDPR beyond the EU? Will other countries adopt similar regulations? Already the EU Data Protection Directive, the predecessor of the GDPR, has been used as a standard in other regions of the world like Latin America or Asia, so I think there will be the same trend when it comes to the GDPR. Even more so, because of the higher sanctions and stricter enforcement under the GDPR <U+0336> there are also a number of countries that want to enable their companies to still do business with Europe and will, therefore, follow the EU data protection framework. Are the big multinationals from the US worried about GDPR at all? They for sure are closely monitoring and following this process. They have already started to adjust their internal compliance frameworks to the GDPR, because they know they have to comply with the GDPR if they want to continue to offer their goods and services in the EU. In my experience, many big multinationals are already well advanced and have built internal teams dealing with the GDPR. By contrast, especially SMEs are still in the process of figuring out if they are even subject to the GDPR. A survey conducted by Dell about a year ago found out that most companies are not ready when it comes to GDPR. In your experience, are companies more prepared today? I think that a lot more companies are more advanced in their preparation today, but I would be surprised if there are any that are fully compliant, since there are a lot of issues in flux. Some aspects of the GDPR may be further regulated by national law, like data processing in the employment context, so companies are still waiting for national laws to be implemented on those topics. And the data protection authorities are expected to issue guidance. A lot of companies have started with auditing their current level of compliance and building a roadmap on how to become GDPR compliant by May 2018 and most companies have advanced on that work plan, but they are far from being ready. There are certainly more organizations that have taken steps than a year ago. Nevertheless, we are still talking to businesses today that haven’t done anything regarding GDPR. This is not only the case for SMEs – also some larger companies are waiting for budget approval or are still trying to understand to what extent they will be subject to the GDPR and who should be responsible internally. Of course, today data protection has become an issue which is discussed at board level, but often there are no actions matching these discussions. Mostly the budgets are still the same as pre GDPR, even though the complexity of the changes that need to be made would require higher budgetary commitments. Additionally, complicating the issue is the fact that the task of making an organization GDPR compliant is often given to a person that has other day-to-day activities, leaving them with little time for this complex matter. In light of BYOD, shadow IT, or the rise of IoT devices – isn’t GDPR readiness of an organization more about education and less about strict processes? In my view, it is a combination of both, as one does not work without the other. If you look at the statistics, a major reason for data getting lost, or being leaked, is employees not being familiar with rules or making mistakes. By training and increasing awareness you are reducing the risk, but you will never get rid of it entirely by just educating staff. The best training needs to be supplemented by processes and technical as well as organisational controls. Just to give an example: You can allow your employees to bring their own device, but you will need to have a proper policy framework around it. Moreover, you need to ensure that company data is secured and, for example, only accessed through encrypted VPN channels or by using sandboxing technology. How big of an impact do you think the stricter rules for consent generation have on new business, like data monetization? These stricter consent rules are certainly posing a challenge for many new sectors and ideas such as data monetization. To the extent that companies depend on consent, certainly business will not get easier in that regard. However, the first step should be to ask whether an organization can process personal data without consent; in other words, if there is another legal basis for data processing – because it is so difficult to obtain consent. However, there are a number of business models where consent is unavoidable. Then, it is a matter of coming up with creative consent mechanisms and tools, to make the consent experience as smooth and easy for the individuals as possible. But it certainly will not be easy. Anyways, I would not want to say that this is the end of new business and data monetization. If I look at the consent rules, they are to some extent very similar to existing rules in Germany, and businesses in Germany have coped with those rules in the past. Overall, (new) business is all about inventing and creating new things and ideas, so I am confident that companies will come up with innovative ways to deal with it.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/photo-1459347268516-3ed71100e718-300x200.jpeg","6.

We believe that in order to successfully navigate between the two worlds you need a third party that speaks two languages – a Match-Maker (aka a duck). Why a duck? Our Match-Maker Attila Keszeg shared this wisdom with us! Ducks do not fly like eagles, do not run like leopards, do not swim like fish, but combine all of it together to successfully operate in all the three apostasies. Nicolai Schaettgen, Jens Wirsching and Joerg Floeck during lunch break We talked about the challenges that all three parties (corporates, startups and Match-Makers) face and discussed key factors that are crucial for the successful Corp-Up.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/startups-corporates-2-different-worlds-interview-with-attila-keszeg/","MatchMakerVentures","Startups & corporates: Two different worlds. Interview with Attila Keszeg","The best of both worlds. Attila Keszeg is a Hungarian-born C-level telecom executive (Deutsche Telekom, Hungarian Telekom, GO) with a 20 year-long journey in FMCG (Pepsi, Red Bull). We got together with Attila to discuss the intersections between the corporate and startup worlds and to get his advice for both parties. What lessons did you learn from working in FMCG? I’m a mechanical engineer but my fortune brought me to FMCG and I stayed there for nearly 20 years. What I learned in FMCG is to focus on customers and perfect execution on the market. There is no 2-year contract to protect you, you need to win the heart of the customer from one shopping trip to another. If your product is available on the shelf, it may be considered. To win, it needs to be relevant, credible and resembling positive brand image. 10 years in Pepsi was a great school for sales and attention to details. 6 years in Red Bull was a perfect school for marketing. What you need to win: 1. Customer focus 2. Relentless execution 3. Attention to detail 4. Excellent sales and marketing Did your past experiences intersect with the telecom industry? Around 2010 I switched industries and went into telecommunications. I was able to convert the know-how and knowledge of my FMCG learnings, especially customer centricity, customer experience, people management, product design aimed at meeting customer needs, and ensuring the right product reaches the right segment. In FMCG, just like in telecom, you are able to achieve your results through people, through selecting the right team and developing it. That’s what I did. We were able to grow profitability by generating greater value from the existing customer base. I’m a great believer in quality, and I’m sure that customers do not want the cheap product, they want the right product. In your roles you had a close relationship with startups. What were the biggest challenges? I was always a big corporate guy, not a startup guy. Big processes, deadlines, KPIs… I struggled with startups at the beginning. I found startups a very interesting phenomenon. I thought they were eating my cake and saw them as competitors. Luckily, I came to the realisation that they are more of a solution, not a problem. I went to Silicon Valley, London, Tel Aviv, and by meeting startup communities I started to understand the way they are working, how they can complement, or even upgrade, what large telecoms are offering. We started to create so called umbrellas, such as security, cross-sell/up-sell, customer experience, TV. There were always very nice startups ready to collaborate. How did you manage to combine the two worlds? Learning how to speak startup language is crucial. Startups and corporates are 2 different worlds. My strength was coming from the corporate side. I know how they think, what their strengths and weaknesses are. We had a lot of bitter startup experiences, we went in too soon and put a corporate structure onto startups. It was suffocating them. They don’t think deadlines like corporates. Demanding the same is naïve – startups are unable to provide the same level reports, KPIs, what a large corporate would enforce. We had to be conscious about what to do and what not to do. We created the greenhouse around startups, nurturing and protecting them at difficult financial times. I was part of Production Innovation Board (PIB), able to influence product development direction and resource allocation. “Make-buy-partner” question is critical for a large corporate. Being a board director of a Berlin-based startup immmer (Deutsche Telekom’s “WhatsApp” currently converted into Magenta Button, an in-house developed chatbot), made me an insider of the startup world. I know enough about the startups to speak the right corporate language to create a perfect environment for a corporate not to rush the decision and return on investment. I know how to integrate the startup into the value creation, how not to compete with your own product development and how to rely more on startups. Top 3 recommendations for startups 1. Ensure there is a clear customer, be practical and target to solve that particular painpoint. I’ve seen many cases how startup developers are too in love with their product and it is not clear what the startup is solving. Have an eye on the user, ensure anyone can use your solution if targeting broad masses. If using your solution requires certain technical knowledge, then you’re developing for experts, not masses. Ensure intuitive usage. 2. Collaborate. There is a lot of openness and collaboration with other startups, reaching out to complement each other’s solutions and combining efforts. Remain collaborative with their future target segments – banks, telcos, make sure sure you have an eye in the market. 3. Spend enough time on the go-to-market and how you will deliver your product to the target audience. This is where matchmakers are coming in – understanding startups, identify channels, how to scale solution.. There are great techy guys who just don’t know how to ensure that the solution reaches the target audience. Top 3 recommendations for corporates 1. Consider startups first before investing in your own development or buying – could be faster and cheaper. In make-buy-partner order should be turned upside down. There is a startup solution for everything. You want to land on the moon – there will be 10 startups working on that this very moment. Why waste time? 2. Scale up very quick. Ensure value creation and improved services are reaching the masses of the corporate customers. Have a purpose, commitment and scale up quick to upgrade your service. 3. Be practical, use the startup for the right purpose. Avoid checklist “startuping”. Don’t do startup management for the sake of the buzzword. Be solution-oriented. Why did you join Match-Maker Ventures as a Match-Maker? I knew about MMV right from the start. I always appreciated what MMV is doing, as I was doing something very similar within Deutsche Telekom – scouting startups, nurturing them and integrating them into corporates. Joining MMV allowed me to utilise my experience and work on something I really enjoy. If you could start your life over, would you choose the same industry to work in? I don’t regret working for FMCG, but I would switch earlier to telco, and most probably the whole startup arena. This is where I see a lot of excitement. When you have millions of startups you need to decide what is good, what is bad, and what is genius. You need experience for that, and I would enter this scene way earlier if I could.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_6694-300x200.jpg","4.

With over 25 years of experience in Strategic Consulting, Public Affairs, Campaigning, Change Communications, Litigation PR and Governmental Relations, he shared his insights on the state of innovation in Switzerland and Farner’s perspectives on startups and corporates. Looking at the Swiss market, in which area (industries) do you see most of the progress being made when it comes up to innovation? And where do you see the biggest challenges? I see most progress in Innovation in Switzerland around the technical universities ETH / EPFL (Federal Universities in Zürich and Lausanne), then in the field of Life Sciences and Health Care (around the pharmaceutical industry in the Basle Area) and growing in Fintech (around Zurich). You are a member of Innovation Board at Farner. Can you share some of the objectives and experiences so far? Each business should be aware of the innovative potential of his own staff and give incentives for good ideas. Farner’s Innovation Board supports and evaluates innovative projects coming from our staff on base of approved business plans. Until now, we realised in the first year two successful projects: The Farner Issue Manager – an automatised search engine to monitor key issues in the parliaments on communal, cantonal and federal level and a full influencer data bank. On the startup side, how is communication helping startups at an early stage of their business idea? And to what degree do you see startups really leveraging the impact of communication? Investors must understand new business ideas before they invest. Many founders are not aware, that the view of the investor differs from the perspective on the business of the entrepreneur. So the right equity story plays a key role in successfully funding a business idea. On the corporate side, to what degree do you see companies sharing openly their innovation experiences and lessons learned with others to improve? And how is Farner helping companies in this regard? In Switzerland we have meanwhile a lot of corporate venturing. Farner has a dense network to big corporates as clients for communication services. We offer this network to startups to help them, to find access to big companies. What are your views on corporates driving innovation with startups? Is it working? Are there best practices out there? There are mixed experiences. Some corporates are too slow and too cumbersome to successfully scout startups. That’s why we are looking to cooperate with partners like Match-Maker Ventures to provide professional B2B connecting services.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/agenda-analysis-business-990818-300x200.jpg","13.

It has never been easier to set up a business, to launch a product or service, and to directly address global markets.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/theageofcollaborationii/","MatchMakerVentures","Age of Collaboration II: Startups + Corporates = Pain or Gain?","The Age of Collaboration is back! 3 years after the first publication, a lot has changed in startup-corporate collaboration. The term in itself became a ‘trendy’ topic of discussion, and likewise more and more corporates are experimenting their way into startup innovation. We felt it was time to get back in the field and investigate what has changed over the past 3 years, what is the current state of play, and what to expect going forward. After all, is startup-corporate collaboration a pain or a gain? On this new study, conducted jointly with Arthur D. Little, and with the support of 8 contribution partners, we managed to outperform the number of participants from the first publication and build an even more representative sample. Over the past months, we surveyed 340 corporate and 203 startup participants from more than 70 countries. In addition, to provide in-depth insights, we discussed the topic of collaboration in 1:1 interviews with a total of 50 successful entrepreneurs and corporate innovation experts. What can you expect from the study? More collaboration, more focus, more impact: startup-corporate collaboration is now a “mass market” phenomenon. We present how corporates and startups are approaching it in 2019. The rise of Corp-Up: commercially focused partnerships (Corp-Up) emerge as the most common and the least stopped engagement approach. We show how both sides can choose the most suitable collaboration setup. The way forward: the majority of corporates still shows an underwhelming level of collaboration activity and quality. We share our outlook for the next 3 years and outline recommendations on how to get closer to the ‘perfect collaborator’ As part of this report, 258 corporates have asked us for a benchmark report assessing their collaboration capabilities against peers.

We invited Marco Bosma, VP Fintech & Innovation at Rabobank, as a guest speaker to give his view on startup-corporate collaboration and share some success stories of Rabobank. Marco is a Fintech advocate driving innovations in the financial services for Rabobank. Next to his role at Rabobank, Marco is a member of the Dutch Blockchain coalition, Robo Valley and Brightlands techruption. Marco has worked in various international management roles at Citibank, ThomsonReuters, ABNAMRO, RBS and Rabobank always translating client demand into technology and data delivery solutions. Why and how does Rabobank collaborate with startups? We have to! Many value chains in financial services are re-inventing themselves today. In this process, existing value chains are challenged and disrupted. The reason why this is happening now is that numerous new technologies have become available such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and blockchain. At the same time, legislation such as Basle IV, GDPR and PSD2 is coming into force aiming to establish a level playing field for new entrants focusing on a particular step in new value chains. You can image that the spectrum of what a bank can cover has exponentially grown. As a result of this, it is impossible for a us to cover this on our own so hence we have no other choice than partnering with startups who are dedicated to build, extend or improve our value chains. Can you share to what degree and in what area do startups help you to drive your corporate innovation agenda? We have focused on retail propositions that can be split in customer service, integrated dashboards and cross needs identification, as well as process improvements such as KYC, AML and product fulfillments like opening- and closing accounts, providing loans and mortgages (Robotics Process Automation). The lesson is that we learn a lot from the ways of working, and have started to adopt design thinking and lean startup approaches, this is all generic so it’s impacting innovation management across the bank. In your view, what have been the main challenges in collaborating with startups so far? What can startups and corporations do to overcome them? I have to make a distinction between in-house developed startup ideas, and external startups that we are engaging with. In terms of setting the right environment to collaborate with external startups, we start by looking at the people. Is this a team that can deliver? Is it diversified enough or do we need to add certain skills or experience to make it successful? Clearly the proposition has to be complementary to Rabobank and synergize with our innovation strategy. The culture is often mentioned. Yes it is important, but not in terms that they have to match. Startups by definition have a different working culture and a different operating pace. You need to find a modus to preserve that. I have not yet met a startup that likes to fully integrate into a bank and pursue life in a corporate career. What would be your advice to startups that want to succeed in the financial services sector? Focus on your strengths and be honest to yourselves in judging the business case. Often the value is in the proposition and the unique expertise, less often in distribution. Many startups do not make it because they are falling into the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) trap. I have seen many ventures who realized too late that the CAC are exceeding the Lifetime Customer Value. So focus on the proposition and find the right distribution partners to reach mass market at low cost. Many collaborations between startups and banks are driven on this win/win aspect in the partnership. Can you share specific success stories from Rabobank in your engagement with startups? We have acquired and built many assets since 2012. We started in the mobile payment area with propositions such as MyOrder and Omnikassa. Later we have added SmartPin, Facturis, Rabo & Co, Peaks, Tellow, Surepay, EasyTrade, Moovement and Go Credible. Some are home grown, some are partnerships with IT or Platform providers. The success is determined by the scalability – the pace (and costs) new users can be on-boarded. Our experience is that you have to allow 3-4 years before new services really get traction. And not to mention you have to be prepared to kill projects when teams struggle too long to determine a marketable proposition. This frees up time to focus on the promising stuff. Banks will need a rich successful portfolio of new propositions to keep client engagement and grow its revenues.","https://www.match-maker.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/photo-1423666523292-b458da343f6a-300x200.jpeg","25.

"https://www.match-maker.ventures/visa-cal-tripled-conversion-rate-with-the-help-of-glassbox/","MatchMakerVentures","Visa CAL tripled conversion rate with the help of Glassbox","The Company Visa CAL, the leading credit card company in Israel, was founded in 1979. It offers credit cards for the world’s leading brands to more than 2.4 million cardholders and tens of thousands of businesses worldwide. In 2015, Visa CAL launched a new product, becoming the first Israeli firm to offer end-to-end online credit card ordering. The Challenge To assess its customer needs and trends, Visa CAL was using a number of tools including web analytics, application logs, business intelligence (BI) systems and media tools. However, despite all of these tools, the company did not have a complete picture of the user experience on their website. The key areas that Visa CAL wanted insights about included: The customer journey within the company’s card ordering system Delays experienced by customers when using the ordering system Areas on the website in which customers struggled to complete a transaction Customer churn and the reasons behind it The Solution Visa CAL turned to digital experience analytics from Glassbox to get a clearer view of the customer journey when ordering and using Visa CAL credit card products. Drilling into user behavior Visa CAL was able to find and watch session replays during which customers ordered credit cards. Using customizable Glassbox dashboards, they were able to analyze customer behavior, including session duration and the number of changes to fields, which the company suspected were impacting customer churn. Understanding customer intentions with click maps With Glassbox’s powerful digital behavior and customer experience analytics solution, Visa CAL gained an understanding of the intentions and behavior of its customer when ordering and using the company’s credit card products. This information gave Visa CAL a data-driven hypothesis of what they needed to do to make the process more intuitive and customer-friendly. Creating streamlined processes In response, Visa CAL embarked on a new project to look closely at the results from Glassbox and fine-tune every stage of the card ordering journey to ensure it matched the needs of the customer and addressed any areas of friction. The Main Results With the data provided by Glassbox and the changes made by Visa CAL based on it, within three weeks the company was able to triple the conversion rate from 19% to 60%. Glassbox brought about a number of changes to the credit card ordering process, all of which are designed to make it easier and more intuitive for the customer: Unnecessary fields in the order process were removed. Some specific fields only appear for relevant customer segments to streamline the process. Optional fields were moved to the end of the process so up-sell products and services are available once the order has been confirmed. Certain fields were changed from drop-down to free-text. Clearer error messages were added to help customers complete the process. General changes to page structure and design were made, including column structure and fields spread over more pages, to remove clutter and improve UX. ""Thanks to Glassbox, we are now able to record each and every customer action from our site. Using analytics, funnels and associated data, we are able to reach intelligent conclusions on customer behavior and have a continuous improvement action plan in place to ensure we continue to evolve and meet the needs of our customers.""

Someone who helps them turn their vision into reality, someone who plans, designs and oversees the process. Someone that works with them through the good times and the bad times – an architect.  A good architect supports you from concept and design to the full realization of your project:  From defining and planning what the project should look like once it is finished, to selecting the right talents, craftsmen, and experts that are needed to get the job done. At the same time, architects make sure that all parties involved are smoothly working together, while closely monitoring their work to ensure that the project is finished on time and at a state-of-the-art quality. The role of an architect is to bring together the creative ideas and visions of the client and keep in mind the needs of those that will be using the new space. We are Architects of Digital Transformation We lead the process of creating functional digital transformation with impact, from concept and ideas to a full realization of the solutions. We work with our partners from start to finish of a project, and help them maneuver through the complex challenges ahead – the only difference being, that our projects are high-tech solutions, digital platforms, measuring impact, or startup incubators, our tools are KPI Trackers or Technology Project Roadmaps, and our craftsmen are not only our internal team, but also our international best-in-class high-tech teams in areas like artificial intelligence, big data, robotics, or blockchain.  Innovation – Impact – Responsibility are what drives us Why do we go to work every single day and love what we do? The answer is rather simple: We aim at making our partners better. We believe that by supporting companies, organizations, and people we work with, we create positive impact for the economy, our society, and the world around us, every single project at a time.

"https://www.tech-house.io/no-innovation-without-impact/","TechHouse","No innovation, without impact!","Over the last years corporates across various industries and company sizes have attempted to drive their internal innovation processes through various vehicles like accelerators, startup collaborations, intrapreneurship programs or by setting up corporate venture funds to infuse the traditional organization with the “magic juice” of innovation.   The hope has been that by simply setting up one of these vehicles – without preparing one’s organization internally and carefully defining goals, performance indicators, and strategies to reach these goals, disruptive and ground-braking results are just going to roll in on their own – a myth, that by know and millions spent later, has been disproven.   Although all of the various approaches to innovation are highly legitimate, their executing and end result is what counts. Simply put in one word: IMPACT.  Impact above all  Don’t get me wrong, we also hadn’t it figured out and molded to perfection when we started our journey together with the Blue Minds Company around six years ago. However, after pooling our experiences and also integrating know-how from success stories, as well as failures, from all over the world, we know that innovation without impact is, to put it bluntly, “useless”.  Having said that, we also know that the road to success is a rocky one, and that there always is potential for setbacks and failure along the way. This success which leads to added value needs to be quantified. Thus, we try to anticipate challenges by closely monitoring performance through our customizable KPI-Tracker along the entire project life cycle.  All our efforts strive towards the goal of creating positive impact for our partners and the corresponding ecosystem – meaning, our work has to make a difference, that can be measured through predetermined KPIs along the entirety of our so called TECHHOUSE Innovation Project Life Cycle (InnoPLC).  Taking on the Challenge – From Concept to Execution  During this process, we go from an in-depth analysis of the partner’s current status quo and identifying technological challenges, followed by a detailed project framing, road-mapping and the establishment of customized KPI-Tracker for the entire project or a data strategy, to executing the project together with a high-tech partner from our international network.   Measure your Impact  During the first conceptual and strategic stages of the InnoPLC, we put a special emphasis on putting together the customized TECHHOUSE KPI-Tracker, that provides transparency on the current status of a project, but also enables all stakeholders to measure and identify the impact and value of the project – no matter if the content’s nature is qualitative or easily quantifiable.  International High-Tech  To be able to not only deliver top-quality conceptual work, but also create best-in-class high-tech solutions, we are working with globally leading technology partners from all around the world, that have proven their expertise in highly complex areas such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, additive manufacturing, or big data transformation.   However, the simple existence of this highly valuable network is not bringing any traction to the organization. To create exactly that, we don’t leave a project after identifying the right high-tech partner from our network, but maneuver through and coordinate the complex execution of the collaboration between the high-tech partner on the one hand, and the corporate partner on the other, as the project owner.  In that way, we do not only ensure the constant tracking of the established performance indicators, but also de-complexify the project for our partners.  At the end of this cycle stands exactly one thing: Positive impact for our partners.  TECHHOUSE Innovation Project Life Cycle: Stage: Readiness HeatmapIn-depth analysis out the current status-quo and examination of company challengesStage: Opportunity Scan & OutlookDetailed project framing, dynamic roadmap creation, KPI establishment and constant tracking of these indicators along the projectStage: International High-Tech Network Application Choosing the right best-in-class technology partnerStage: Solution BuilderProject execution with tech- and corporate partnerStage: Scale-Up EnablerSolution Rollout and Scaling (MVP)","https://www.tech-house.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-innovation-without-impact.jpg","October 15, 2020","en",0.9929558634758,0.0816024914383888,0.74259626865387,0.0659328028559685,0.109868481755257

Startup Genome reports that at the beginning of this year, the number of Chinese venture capital Series A+ deals went down to 26% of the December levels, which amounts to a drop of 57%-points in comparison to the cumulative value for the rest of the world. In a similar situation globally, around 25,5 billion EUR in startup investments could go missing in just two months. Should the crisis last longer, this could result in a decrease of up to 78 billion EUR in VC investments in 2020. Governments are slowly stepping up With an absence of inflow from sales or venture capital, governments and public institutions around the world are beginning to step in. Germany has announced support for startups by means of short-term financial assistance worth around 2 billion EUR. Israel Innovation Authority is going to provide an immediate infusion of 165 million EUR to the high-tech industry as an initial measure for dealing with the crisis, whereas Austria just signed off on a significant support package for the local startup ecosystem.  Similar Challenges all around the World Markus Raunig, Managing Director of AustrianStartups, describes the current situation as followed: “85% of startups in Austria are negatively affected by the corona crisis. Revenues have decreased by 50% on average and 42% of the startups are struggling with the suddenly extremely difficult fundraising environment. Consequently, the Austrian government has announced a rescue fund for startups that doubles up investments in startups that are affected by the crisis with public money, as well as taking over a 50% guarantee for a new VC fund to be set up in the coming weeks.” On the other side of the pond, James Mister, Executive Director for Bavaria’s US Offices in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sees the current situation as a wake-up call for a startup bubble, that has seen company valuations rise to astronomical highs in the months leading up to the crisis: “Investors are becoming less risk averse, revising growth projections, and may even be reducing committed capital.For startups the game is to find ways to generate revenue while extending their runway by, for example, streamlining operations and reigning in discretionary spending. In some cases, this has unfortunately led to layoffs – even companies that had reached their Series E round if they were exposed to business and leisure travel, shared mobility, etc. COVID-19 may not bode well for the sharing economy for the next 18-24 months—and by then social distancing behaviors may be the new status quo.” Back in Europe Heiko Huber, Managing Director of Munich-based TechFounders reports: “Many markets have disappeared overnight – B2B sales in particular are hardly possible in the current situation, and investors are focusing on securing their existing portfolios. At the same time, many founders have shown tremendous agility when it comes to adaption of their business models, improvement of capital efficiency, or refocusing on their core product.” In Israel Shuli Shwartz, Managing Director of Technion DRIVE Accelerator in Haifa is witnessing similar developments within the Startup Nation’s ecosystem:“Fundraising in some cases halted, and is expected to be more difficult in the coming year or more, with company valuations expected to be way more conservative. Attention is currently given to lowering the burn-rate in order to sustain a runway for 18 – 24 months, while inward-working on the product.Especially early stage startups, that depend on angel investment might face major difficulties due to the downturn in the global financial market in which a big chunk of potential angels` money is invested.” A Light at the End of the Tunnel However, Shwartz adds, the crisis can also be turned into opportunity: “In the US more than half of the Fortune 500 companies were created during a recession phase, and over 50 tech unicorns were founded between 2007 and 2009. New tech verticals like telehealth or high -tech automation processes in industrial environments and supply chains can arise as the winners of this situation.” In addition, investors have shown positive signals in verticals such as AR/VR, home fitness, or tools for distributed teams. Raunig highlights that it is also important to consider startups as part of the solution to the crisis, whereas Huber concludes“If we can help innovative companies to maneuver through the current crisis, we have the chance to create an even stronger ecosystem afterwards. “   A light at the end of the tunnel.","https://www.tech-house.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blogpost_crisis2-800x400.jpeg","October 4, 2020","en",0.993324756622314,0.000596145138842985,0.92353281378746,0.0541067306185141,0.0217643328942358

We all must now work together to reorganize our daily lives, create new structures and establish new daily routines to keep our things going. In private with our families and friends, and professionally with our colleagues, teams and business partners. For this to succeed, we need new digital communication tools, so that we can continue our work the best way possible over the next few months and also rethink work and cooperation itself for the time after the crisis. To ensure that communication within our company and with our business partners – in Techhouse’s case across different locations, countries, and time zones – can continue to work, new leadership skills are needed, that connect everyone in our team and partner network: Inclusion and empathy, but also trust in your team’s abilities, are more important than ever – for us these are essential skills so that remote work can succeed. At TECHHOUSE we are applying various digital cooperation tools to work on our projects and tasks from wherever we are around the world. A clear structure and a high level of independence – going hand in hand with the same level of individual accountability and solidarity within the team – has helped us greatly in this new challenging process.  Yes, it is a challenge to establish new professional structures and routines as quickly and efficiently as possible, which enable getting the whole team on board – and keep it there during the time of Corona crisis, of which we don’t know how long it will last. But it is also the time when we as business leaders should ask ourselves the vital question: How can we use this crisis also as an opportunity to create structures, that fully embrace the digital space and economy, and the possibilities that go hand in hand with it? Although the current situation is challenging, we should not be scared to ask questions like this one, and engage in further considerations. Let us not only manage the crisis, but let us also use it question the status quo and get a head start for the challenges of the future. Let’s take full advantage of the possibilities that modern technologies and the digital world offer us, but let’s also not forget to reflect on what we could have done better on an individual level, but also as society as a whole.  This is how the TECHHOUSE team is tackling the crisis and what we have learned: Fostering the “WE-Feeling”: Although every individual team member will have to do his or her part, the idea that we are all working towards a common goal has brought us closer together and has made us stronger to tackle the challenges ahead of usPsychological Safety: For us clear and inclusive communication within our international team on a daily and structured basis is a key element for success of the organizationTrust, Independence & Accountability: Everybody is aware of the situation and his or her individual responsibility. Applying the Tool Set: Using various digital communication and collaboration tools to work with our colleagues and business partners from wherever we are      around the worldKeeping the Individual in Mind: We live empathy and inclusionHumour: Never lose it (GIFs help ;)  ","https://www.tech-house.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crisis-2-800x400.jpeg","October 1, 2020","en",0.995457887649536,0.000529709213878959,0.784066915512085,0.000603186606895179,0.214800208806992

"https://www.trendingtopics.at/factory-1-post-acceleration-kapsch/","Factory1","Corporates & Startups: How to Avoid Mistakes in The Post-Acceleration Phase","Factory1 is one of the most popular examples of a corporate startup accelerator in Europe. The second Factory1 edition led to two partnerships between startups and the Austrian company Kapsch TrafficCom. Still, several stumbling blocks to promising corporate-startup partnerships are bound to come up in the post-acceleration phase: conflict with existing business, lack of buy-in from decision makers, and insufficient resources. In a new whitepaper, Kapsch is reflecting on the lessons learned from the accelerator, which can be downloaded here for free. The whitepaper shows five ways on how to keep corporate-startup collaborations going during the post-acceleration phase. In this interview, Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1, explains what the post-acceleration gap is, how to avoid mistakes and how important commitment to long term partnerships is. What is the post-acceleration gap? Simrit Sandhu: We can all acknowledge that large corporates like Kapsch and small startups are highly complementary in many aspects. We as a corporation get support in search for innovation and our startups receive help to improve their execution. Despite the mutual interest and complementary assets, we have faced several barriers in successfully collaborating. It is a fact that diverse ways of working and cultural differences make us distinctly different organizations. The pace and intensity of the Factory1 program requires tremendous efforts and focus from all stakeholders involved. Within these 4 months, many rules and structures don’t apply to us. After the accelerator though, corporate mentors are likely to return to their daily jobs and the priorities of our startups might shift as well. The post-acceleration gap is essentially what we call the divergence in working styles of Kapsch and our startups after the demo day. Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1, on stage. © KapschWhat are the most common mistakes that happen in the post acceleration phase? One of the mistakes that is made during the program and has strong implications in the post acceleration phase is not linking the startup to the right stakeholders within and outside of the organization. We are therefore very thoughtful in setting up various touch point throughout the Factory1 program, introducing the startups to Kapsch executives, managers and experts. Another risk is fading interest after the demo day in the collaboration. Building up a business opportunity and losing focus and drive after the demo day can happen very quickly. It is one of the major pitfalls that comes with the post acceleration gap and a mistake we are trying to prevent at all costs. But after putting an enormous amount of effort, time and financial resources into an acceleration program like Factory1, the most painful mistake would be to completely lose touch with the startups. Keeping at least some level of connection can bring valuable insights int future developments on both sides and potential business opportunities down the road. How can these mistakes be avoided? How do you prevent drop-offs? We have worked out two approaches to avoid a fading connection with our Factory1 startups. First, we involved the business unit managers right from the start which eliminated the need for an actual hand over from the accelerator management team to the business after the acceleration phase. The business units took ownership by defining the search fields for the program and appointing Kapsch mentors for each area. Second, we empowerd the Kapsch mentors as relationship owners and as the main startup collaboration contact for the acceleration phase and after. They walk with the startup from start to finish and beyond. The main problem we tried to avoid was having to internally “sell” the startup-project after it has already been proven successful in the acceleration program. From our experience, that’s the moment when the collaboration collapses. But having driven Kapsch mentors guiding the startup through the organizational complexities has proven to be incredibly important. After the accelerator, corporates and startups are likely to return to their daily business. How can they keep on working together? For our second edition of Factory1, we took an active interest in the progress of the collaboration, rather than relying on requests from either our business units or the startups for continued conversations. We held biweekly update calls with the startups and internal stakeholders who might benefit from the startup’s solution. Introducing our startups to many internal stakeholders beyond the program helps them to reduce the dependency on their mentor and should give an insight to the complex corporate decision-making processes. What was your biggest learning from the Factory1 post acceleration phase? It is essential to clearly define which corporate relationship helps the projects current trajectory. In our case, we place a strong focus on generating interest from first customers in order to get the required support from all inhouse stakeholders. Luckily our startups are very proactive when it comes to getting exposure and suggesting customer development opportunities to us. In the end, both us and the startups gear all efforts towards taking the next step on our journey to a long term strategic partnership.","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/marc-sendra-martorell-Vqn2WrfxTQ-unsplash-644x362.jpg","06.

In Silicon Valley it’s The Other Way Round.","„If you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair”, sang Scott McKenzie in 1967. If the famous song would have been written today, the lyrics probably would say: “Be sure to pitch your startup idea.” San Francisco and Silicon Valley are the epicenter of global innovation. Nowhere else in the world you can find such density of startups, VCs and large tech companies. The five startups from this year’s cohort of Factory1, the corporate accelerator of the Austrian tech company Kapsch, got the chance to spend one week in the Bay Area to visit tech giants like Apple, Google or Facebook, to meet and chat with VCs like Autotech Ventures and to feel the spirit of the University of Stanford, where the founders of Google, Intel, Paypal or Cisco have studied. The Factory1 delegation at the gates of Stanford. © Factory1Network effects “The size and scale of everything is impressive. It is like Europe, but you have to add a zero to everything,” says David Gugelmann, CEO and founder of cybersecurity startup Exeon Analytics from Switzerland. Together with the founders of Aerostate from Russia, Bestmile from Switzerland, DerQ from the United Arab Emirates and ObjectBox from Germany, he took part in a dense acceleration week. The goal: establish contacts in Silicon Valley, evaluate the US market and learn from the biggest startup ecosystem in the world. “I’m a huge fan of not over-estimating Silicon Valley,” says Vivien Dollinger, CEO of Objectbox, which provides an edge database for IoT devices. But arriving in San Francisco, she seamlessly got introduced to the very open culture. “I expected to drink a coffee and just run into a VC. You always hear stories like that. And I really met some people that way,” says Vivien. The Factory1 delegation visits Facebook. © Factory1The show must go on After meeting experts like Friedrich Prinz, professor at Stanford, the startup founders of Factory1 got deep insights into the advantages and disadvantages of Silicon Valley. “The main learning for me is that the startup business is often not that smooth as it is communicated”, says David. Silicon Valley startups are well-known for very good marketing, but underneath the surface, things often look different. “It is always a long journey with a lot of money involved”, says David who spoke to founders. “That is an important insight. Sometimes you have to pivot, and it is good to see that this is always an option.” The reality Silicon Valley includes a lot of show. Founders, venture capitalists, and top engineers are celebrated like pop stars. “It is much more of a show than in Europe. I was aware of that, but I did not expect that this show thing would be that important”, says David. “There must be a show involved, but in the end, the technology has to be robust. Otherwise, you won’t survive.” The Factory1 delegation in Front of Apple Park. © Factory1It’s the culture, not the technology Silicon Valley is one of the major tech hubs worldwide – which does not mean that European technology is not as good. “The quality of engineers in Silicon Valley is the same as in Europe. It would not make sense to move our development here, but it makes definitely sense to do sales here”, says David, a former postdoc at ETH Zurich. “The main reason why people here are more successful is that they have much more confidence. In Europe people are much more afraid of failing”, says David. “The engineers here are very expensive, and they are less loyal, so the change a lot and just go for the money. Vivien, who studied at TU Munich, agrees: “I think we have a better education in Germany or Austria. But here you have the networks that push talents forward.” A well-known fact is that VCs in Silicon Valley prefer to invest in founders who already have failed. They will avoid the mistakes they fell into before. “In Europe, you are successful if you don’t screw up. In Silicon Valley it’s the other way around”, says David. Vivien adds: “People raise millions on ideas. That does not happen in Germany. That makes the US a very good place for startups.” The Factory1 delegation visits the legendary HP garage. © Factory1Why not relocate? For US founders, it often seems that they can raise millions very easily. That would not work for European founders who come to the Bay Area, Vivien says: “There is a strong cultural difference, and that makes it harder for European startups to get clients, deals or to raise money in the US.” Still, her team thinks of relocating to the US in the future. “Valuations tend to be much better in the US. Our company has a lot of traction, but not a lot of revenue. Traction is valued much higher in the US, and that is a good reason why we consider relocating to Silicon Valley”, says Objectbox’s CEO. “But currently we prefer to be based in Europe.” Today, she would not want to transfer the company’s IP to the States and keeps it in Europe. “Once the IP is in the US, you can’t get it out again.” Exeon Analytics also wants to stay in Europe. “Expanding to the US is an interesting option, but it is not our main priority. We are a European company, and we use that fact that we are Swiss as part of our marketing”, says David. “It would not make sense to move development here, but it makes definitely sense to do sales overseas.”","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/San-Francisco_Unsplash-644x362.jpg","14.

"https://www.trendingtopics.at/factory1-accelerator-mentors-kapsch/","Factory1","„Startups can open our eyes with disrupting ideas“: This is how the Factory1 accelerator works","Once self-driving cars take over our streets, everything will get better. Less traffic, less CO2, fewer accidents, more parking spaces. Right? Well, forecasts are hard to make, especially when they concern the not so near future. Meanwhile according to other studies the robo-cars might slow down the whole traffic and make it all less efficient. The mobility of the future and the effects of autonomous vehicles are topics that the Austrian tech company Kapsch also addresses. It is known worldwide for its toll systems, traffic infrastructure and mobility management systems. Traffic of the future is unpredictable „Some studies say that autonomous driving will provide more traffic. If self-driving cars become affordable for everyone, then they will compete with public transport“, said Christoph Seybold. “And we have to be prepared for this scenario.” At Kapsch, Christoph works as a solution consultant, but recently also as a startup mentor. This year, international startups will once again participate in the in-house Factory1 accelerator program. 193 startups have applied and four to five young companies will be invited to take part in the five-month program. „We have evaluated whether there are any solutions that we can integrate with,“ says Barbara Hollinger, Business Development Manager at Kapsch. Like Christoph, she is one of the 60 international mentors who will take care of the startups. „We are looking for startups that are already on the market and have made sales.” Individualism vs. tower manager Mobility Platforms, Integrated Urban Mobility, Data Privacy, Smart Autonomous Platforms – Factory1 is all about the mobility of the future. This new reality might seem far away, but is indeed approaching in giant leaps, and it comes with some effects that could be surprising. For example, self-driving cars themselves are considered expensive, but this image changes drastically once they are integrated into car sharing services. „There are calculations that fares will fall so sharply that they c<U+043E>uld undercut the price of the subway tickets,“ says Christoph. That would increase demand, and instead of less cars on the streets, there would suddenly be more. This is also because conventional vehicles do not disappear overnight. „This mixed traffic will cause considerable problems,“ says Barbara. “We need to be prepared for this challenge. Taking innovative ideas into account in collaboration with startups can help” Kapsch is investigating solutions from the complete vehicle individualism to a fully centralized control of every movement. „Opinions significantly vary whether self-driving vehicles will coordinate themselves or if they will be managed from a central point similar to airplanes from a tower,“ says startup mentor Christoph. „Self-driving vehicles could be directed by a traffic management center. We’re already considering what components are needed to set up such a system.“ „Startups can open our eyes“ And this is where startups come in. „We already have well-founded and patented tech solutions in-house, but keeping up with rapidly changing market demands can become a challenge for large companies“ says Barbara. „That’s where startups come in. They can open our eyes with disrupting ideas.“ The goal of Factory1: From February to June, the young companies will develop a proof of concept in the accelerator, which ideally works in conjunction with existing Kapsch solutions. At the end of the program, there should be a close collaboration. Even a complete takeover is conceivable. „Ideally, we can position ourselves jointly in the market,“ says Barbara. The perfect startup The selection process for the accelerator is demanding. „The perfect startup can dock its solution to ours and shares our vision,“ says Barbara. „Of course, with almost 200 applicants, those who can’t present their pitches properly fall out. On the other hand: a startup that throws out perfect marketing phrases but doesn’t have a profound solution as a basis won’t work either.” Founders should better think in advance what the benefits they can offer Kapsch are. „Some have really thought about concrete use cases and see where they could work with us. Someone who only wants funding but does not propose a concrete solution has a hard time with us,“ says Barbara. If founders are only looking for investment, they won’t make it into the accelerator. „If a team of 200 people makes zero revenue, or if a startup wants to raise ten million and has no CFO – then skepticism is appropriate,“ says Christoph. “We can be very fast” Even those who only want to get access to customer (Kapsch has 100 branches worldwide and generates more than one billion euros in turnover per year) should not be too optimistic soon. „Our customers are governments and cities that are often very conservative. It’s hard to get access to them as a startup. But if we as a company stand behind a startup, then a new top technology can take off,“ says Christoph. Kapsch is the lever to make a new product big. „When we see that there is something big in Factory1, we can be very fast.”","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kapsch-644x362.jpg","29.

Accelerator programs have been established for startups that companies collaborate with on specific topics. But it is not only external tech start-ups whose know-how can be tapped. In addition to Factory1, a startup accelerator, the Austrian tech company Kapsch has started to rely on intrapreneurship. „We believe in the power to reinvent ourselves from our own ranks and in the innovation potential of our own employees,“ says Cornelia Wolf, Head of Corporate Innovation at Kapsch TrafficCom AG since December 1st. For the first time this year, the company therefore implemented an Innovation Sprint for employees, in which three teams spent six days examining a problem and then working on a solution or a prototype. Shaping the future of the company The 16 participants, who participated in the Innovation Sprint from all levels of the company, were formed into three teams – from lawyers to technicians to senior experts, virtually all areas of the company were represented. „That’s a great range of participants we’ve managed. This was very well reflected in the creativity of the teams,“ says Wolf. „The prerequisite for participation comprises attitude and commitment. The participants all have an honest interest in shaping the future of the company. © KapschHow does an innovation sprint work in detail? „The first half of the sprint is for deep diving into the problem, the second half is for developing the solution,“ Wolf explains. Urban mobility“ was the overriding theme. In three challenges, the three teams provided solution for the following pains,which were defined according to the respective target groups: B2B (Business to Business): Companies entering the urban area in a more coordinated way so that they reach their destination punctually and predictably. B2C (Business to Consumer): Ensuring stress-free, sustainable and predictable mobility from A to B. B2G (Business to Government): Making the complexity of mobility issues understandable and tangible.

Make the company’s pearls of innovation visible After the problem phase, it’s time to move on to the solution phase. Based on developed customer journeys and personas, the teams developed the first mock-ups and prototypes. On the sixth day, the final task was to prepare a pitch for the 17 internal jury members. „All three ideas developed by the teams will soon be presented to the entire Global Leadership Team,“ says Wolf. Then it will be clear how the projects will proceed and how they will fit to the company’s goals. „We are currently in the process of creating possible forms of employee participation,“ says Wolf. After all, some participants in the Innovation Sprint are already on fire and would like to devote 100 percent of their time to the topics they have worked on. One thing is already certain: an Innovation Sprint can properly motivate employees. And: „With this format you make your company’s pearls of innovation visible,“ says Wolf. „We want to carry out the next Sprint in 2020, this time at a foreign subsidiary.“ © Kapsch","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kapsch_Innovation_Sprint_3-644x362.jpg","19.

On June 18, the second batch of startups will present their Proof of Concepts (PoC) to selected industry experts and the top management of Kapsch on Demo Day 2K19 in Vienna. These PoCs are meant to be the foundation for long-term strategic partnerships between Kapsch and the startups. In a new whitepaper published today, Kapsch shares its experiences with the accelerator program and lays out a stepwise framework for designing corporate-startup collaborations based on existing research, own studies, and the Factory1 experience. The whitepaper is aimed at managers who want to know how navigate the challenges and capture the benefits of corporate-startup collaborations. Wide range of opportunities Hackathons, events, startup services, incubators, accelerators, investments, acquisitions – companies have a wide range of opportunities to work together with startups. „Rather than a horizontal accelerator that is open to a wide range of startups, we opted for a vertically-focused program in the mobility sector“, Kapsch writes. „We decided on equity-free project funding for several reasons. First, early-stage investment was not a priority for us. Second, we wanted to attract later-stage startups for which giving up equity is not an attractive proposition. Third, we wanted to leverage our accelerator to learn about the ventures and then selectively invest in the most promising ones after the program.“ Important changes The whitepaper also describes how the right people were brought into the program, how promising startups were selected and how procedures were simplified to be faster. The whitepaper is the foundation for the improvements Kapsch introduced to Factory1. The most important changes that that have been implemented in the second round of Factory1 are: The entire board (CEO, CTO, and COO) now sponsors Factory1 in order to ensure executive commitment and involvement throughout the program The search fields are closer aligned with Kapsch’s business units so as to increase the strategic fit Kapsch is aiming to establish partnerships and equity investments in the case of successful proof-of-concepts. The post-acceleration phase is clearly structured, with dedicated people responsible for pursuing collaborations beyond the program. Partnership talks are included during the program and, after the demo day, Kapsch has a pre-scheduled follow-up meeting with potential startup partners If your are interested, you can download the whitepaper here for free.","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kapsch_Factory1-644x362.jpg","11.

The view from the terrace of the 25hours Hotel in the city center is amazing and the shining lights of Austria’s capital invite to explore the nightlife. But the founders of five international start-ups did not come to Vienna for sightseeing. They came to participate in the first acceleration week of Kapsch’s Factory1. 193 startups have applied for the corporate accelerator, five of them finally made it and are now going to enter the four-month program. Aerostate from Russia, Exeon Analytics and Bestmile from Switzerland, DerQ from United Arab Emirates and ObjectBox from Germany have defined their Proof of Concepts (PoC) with one of the largest technology companies in Austria. Within the next four months, they will have to prove that they can integrate their solutions into the Kapsch portfolio. Aus Datenschutz-Gründen ist dieser Inhalt ausgeblendet.

They need to have their own first customers and be able to finish projects with our customers”, says Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1. 60 Kapsch mentors from 14 different countries work together with the startups – in Vienna, but also in Silicon Valley. “That is really important for our own company culture. We want to be ready to work together with young companies and new ideas”, says Simrit. “Expectation management is very important. Some corporates underestimate that they need a lot of patience and endurance. That’s why Factory1 is all about long-term goals and not about quick wins. We want to establish real relationships with the startups.” The startups have expectations too. “Kapsch has huge expertise in traffic management and forecasting. With the help of their data, we expect to be able to provide better accuracy for our air quality forecasting”, says Ruslan Zhuravlev, Head of Research of Aerostate. His company has developed an air quality management platform for smart cities. “Maybe we can offer sensor management together with Kapsch to industry customers.” © Kapsch“The company owner is pushing the accelerator” What the startups most appreciate about Kapsch are the opportunities to jointly launch a product on the market and offer it to the company’s customers worldwide. “Usually big corporates tend to move slowly. They want our product, but often they have other priorities. But at Kapsch, the company owner is pushing the startup accelerator, and that helps a lot”, says David Gugelmann, CEO and founder of Exeon Analytics from Switzerland. Gugelmann has specialized in cybersecurity solutions and looks for corporate customers. “Our algorithms can identify cyber attacks very fast. Sometimes it takes companies up to 200 days to detect a cyber attack, but we can do it within one day”, says David. “Our technology can be interesting for Kapsch BusinessCom, because they manage critical networks for customers as well as the whole Kapsch Group. Our software can be an add-on to their cyber defense center.” The technologies of the five startups are very different, but all have to do with mobility and can find their place in Kapsch’s many divisions. © Kapsch“Our mission is to eliminate road accidents”, says Georges Aoude, co-founder and CEO of DerQ from the UAE. “We take live feeds of road cameras and other sensors. Our algorithms can predict what will happen in the next few seconds on the road. For example, we can predict if a pedestrian will cross the road or if a cyclist takes a right or left turn.” By detecting pedestrians, cyclists, and cars at crossroads, DerQ wants to alarm vehicles to break in time to avoid accidents. Georges has a clear goal on how to integrate with Kapsch: “Kapsch develops roadside units that communicate with connected vehicles. We could provide the software to predict accidents. We can address use cases that are important both to their customers and our customers.” “We see ourselves in a lot of places” Bestmile from Switzerland and ObjectBox from Munich are also looking for win-win situations. “I think there is huge potential for cooperation. Kapsch has Fluidtime, a provider of MaaS solutions, and we are working on a proof of concept on how to integrate our solution with Fluitime”, says Raphael Gindrat, CEO of Bestmile. His startup works on a software platform that enables mobility companies (e.g. public transport providers in cities) to offer new services such as ride-hailing, ride pooling, micro-transit, robotaxi and autonomous shuttle services. The Kapsch subsidiary Fluidtime would be the perfect partner for Bestmile. “We empower edge computing. We allow devices to operate offline in real time, and we improve data security”, says Vivien Dollinger, CEO of Objectbox. “We work on a PoC for Kapsch’s railway system. We can help them to synchronize their data not only across their trains but also across their servers. There is the opportunity to be integrated into some of their products. We have a tool that Kapsch can use to improve efficiency and speed and reduce costs. We see ourselves in a lot of places.” © Kapsch“Be a good partner” Whether everything will work well for the selected startup will show in the next weeks and months until the final Demo Day. “The trick is to prove that the startup is a good partner. It would be ok if a PoC takes a bit longer – but in the end, it should work”, says Simrit, Program Lead of Factory1. “We expect that not everything works out in the estimated time. Basically, all five startups in the program are very promising and on track.”","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kapsch_Factory_1-644x362.jpg","15.

"https://www.trendingtopics.at/the-big-idea-of-maas-you-dont-need-a-car-anymore/","Factory1","The Big Idea of MaaS: You Don’t Need a Car Anymore","There is a race going on, but nobody knows who will win. Electric mobility, car sharing, autonomous vehicles, and connected cars are the four major areas in which car manufacturers, internet giants, and technology companies are competing for the future of mobility. At the end of the day, it’s all about who has primary access to the consumer. As fewer and fewer young people get driving licenses, fewer and fewer people in cities want to afford a car and more and more consumers want to get from A to B sustainably, intelligent mobility services are in demand. „A real paradigm shift“ „The entire mobility space is in a phase of major upheaval. A real paradigm shift is taking place,“ says Wolfgang Brückler, Senior Expert Mobility Solutions at Kapsch TrafficCom. „There is a massive trend towards the sharing economy, and owning a car in the city is becoming increasingly unattractive. Autonomous driving will lead to a sharp drop in mobility prices. That in general means – people’s mobility habits are changing massively.“ In order to absorb these changing habits, more and more companies are working on Mobility as a Service (MaaS). „The whole idea behind Mobility as a Service is that you no longer need your own car“, says Wolfgang. From public transport and car sharing services to rental bicycles and e-scooters – theoretically, a MaaS provider could give its users access to all these mobility services for a monthly fee – a mobility subscription that includes everything you need to get from A to B. The ultimate mobility subscription In Scandinavian countries, companies have already started to build MaaS – fueled by Austrian know-how. For example, the startup UbiGo from Sweden combines public transport, car sharing, car rental and taxis in one intermodal mobility service. Each household can choose a monthly subscription, which all family members can use. „This is one of the very few MaaS operators that is currently rolling out the service,“ says Wolfgang. UbiGo would not be possible without the partnership with Kapsch. The Kapsch subsidiary Fluidtime supplies the cloud-based service solution for UbiGo, which handles everything from planning and booking to payment. As a cloud provider, Fluidtime provides the technical platform on which MaaS providers around the world can build their apps. Customers don’t always have to be private companies – cities or regions could also use the software to launch quickly their own MaaS offerings. Fluitime, for example, is also part of a public-private innovation project in the City of Aarhus in Denmark. In Aarhus, Fluidtime is responsible for operating a MaaS platform that supports both public and private transport operators. The goal ist to support collective forms of transport in order to reduce environmental pollution and CO2 emissions. Challenges ahead In order to bring the maximum value to the customers, MaaS services combine many different mobility providers. „The MaaS idea is very young. It’s challenging to get the many mobility providers on board. Some are afraid to give up end-customer contact,“ says Wolfgang. There seems to be a little misconception. In the end, all that matters for MaaS platforms is to supply their mobility partners with more new users, not to snatch away their existing ones. In any case, consumers have the money for MaaS – the total cost of owning a car often exceeds 300 euros per month. This amount could be spent on mobility subscriptions and in this case, users no longer need to worry about refueling, garages or winter tires. Combined with electromobility, MaaS offers one more fringe benefit: more eco-friendly mobility.","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MaaS_Pexels-780x439.jpg","28.

"https://www.trendingtopics.at/these-5-international-startups-made-it-to-the-factory1-accelerator-of-kapsch/","Factory1","These 5 International Startups Made it to the Factory1 Accelerator of Kapsch","193 startups have applied for the Kapsch corporate accelerator Factory1. Five of them finally made it and are now going to enter the four-month program of „Factory1 2K19“ and receive equity free financial resources and expert mentoring. It was a difficult decision for the jury of experts to select five winners from the top 15, all of whom developed and presented tailor-made concepts for Kapsch. The potential participants of Factory1 came from ten different countries, from Switzerland to Israel and Canada. „Innovation happens when you start thinking out of the box“, said Marcus Handl, Head of Corporate Development & Innovation and Factory1 Program Owner, at the opening of the Winner’s Ceremony at Reaktor Vienna. „Startups can simply be faster in certain areas because they do not have to pay attention to certain things and they do not have to pay any attention to processes,“ adds CEO Georg Kapsch in an interview with Trending Topics. Cooperation more important than takeover The focus this year is on startups that want to shape the future of mobility. „We are very much involved in data analysis, we are very much involved in monitoring critical situations in traffic and especially on the infrastructure side,“ says Kapsch, explaining the program’s focus. In the foreground is the cooperation with the agile startup companies and not so much a possible participation or takeover. Kapsch does not want to exclude the latter, but: „We need precisely these entrepreneurs, who founded these companies, who are enthusiastic about them. What’s in it for us when we buy them? „ 53 mentors for proof of concept 53 mentors from 14 countries and various companies of the Kapsch Group will accompany the program. In four months, the startups will lead concepts and prototypes to a proof of concept. The solutions developed jointly with the young entrepreneurs are intended to be the basis for longer-term collaborations. How startups can benefit from working with large industrial companies? „The moment it comes to the real innovation, ie the implementation of the idea, it needs a certain professionalization and customer service,“ says Georg Kapsch, who is also president of the Federation of Austrian Industries. The 5 participants of Factory1 2K19 are: Aerostate, USA Aerostate provides cities and businesses with air quality analysis and 4-day weather forecasts by city district. The analytics tools convert the raw forecast data into realizable findings for apps or IoT applications. The platform is designed to help cities make decisions that impact the city ecology. The startup has its origins in Moscow, Russia and was founded in 2015 by Dmitry Solomentsev. Bestmile, Switzerland The Swiss startup Bestmile is working on the optimization of public and private fleets consisting of autonomous and vehicles with human drivers. Their platform helps to deploy, manage, and optimize fleets with any type of vehicle for any type of service. Customers include PostBus, Switzerland’s largest bus transit company. Objectbox, Germany Objectbox has developed a database that is especially optimized for small IoT and mobile devices. The database needs less than 1 MB storage space and, according to Objectbox, is many times faster than competing products. Exeon Analytics, Switzerland Exeon Analytics uses machine learning to analyze activities in a corporate network and to identify and investigate malware infections and data breaches hiding in regular network traffic. According to the Startup this allows the customers to find the so-called needle in the haystack and transform collected log data into actionable security insights. Derq, United Arab Emirates Through the use of Artificial Intelligence and connected vehicle technology, Derq can anticipate and prevent car crashes. The startup is based in Dubai based and originally a spin-off from MIT. In 2017 Derq went through the renowned Techstars accelerator.","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/factory1-644x362.jpg","04.

"https://www.trendingtopics.at/your-car-will-talk-to-the-road-which-will-make-a-lot-of-cool-things-possible/","Factory1","Your car will talk to the road. Which will make a lot of cool things possible.","Today, many things are connected to the Internet – from flower pots to TV sets and sneakers. One very important part of our lives is surprisingly not connected yet: the cars. The communication process between vehicles and the infrastructure still primarily happens through the human drivers – they look at traffic lights, wave pedestrians across the road or nod to each other at intersections. But so-called V2X communication and the increasing automation of vehicles will change this very soon. „For us, V2X describes the vision that vehicles can communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure,“ says Oliver Brandl, VP Business Development at the Solution Center Connected Road at Kapsch TrafficCom. „While the whole world has been connected, cars have been overlooked so far. Even if today’s vehicles are very smart and have many sensors, they do not exchange information with others“. „I am here“, says the car That’s gonna change fast. Car manufacturers like Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors and Daimler have already announced that they will be launching vehicles, equipped with the necessary technology for V2X communication. „Connected vehicles will become part of everyday life long before autonomous vehicles. This technology is ready for the market,“ says Oliver. The aim is to make traffic more efficient and safer. Glossary: Who is talking to whom?V2X – Vehicle to EverythingV2I – Vehicle to InfrastructureV2P – Vehicle to PersonV2V – Vehicle to Vehicle Development of V2X has been an ongoing process for the past ten years. „Kapsch has always been involved in communication, this is the thread running through the company’s history,“ says Barbara Hollinger, Business Development Manager at Kapsch. „We can now see that more and more vehicles that can communicate with the infrastructure are coming to the road. We want to prepare our customers, i.e. road operators and cities, for this scenario“. Using the “ITS G5” standard, a Wireless LAN based technology, cars are able to send a „I am here“ message ten times per second – and receive messages from other vehicles, the road infrastructure and traffic management centers. These messages include, for example, what kind of car is where, at what speed it is driving and in which direction. Factory1: Looking for startups „Experts say that highly automated or even autonomous driving will only be possible if the vehicles are connected to each other. Today, humans communicate with each other and convert this information into driving movements. Cars must also develop these capabilities,“ says Oliver. The technical infrastructure is key for this scenario. Today, it’s already possible and in test phase (for example on the motorway near Vienna Airport) for the road itself to send information to cars – for example information about a traffic jam or speed limits. This data can be shown to the driver on a display. In the future, however, self-driving cars will also have to be able to process such data in real time – and this holds potential that exceeds the capabilities of human drivers by far. In the V2X area, Kapsch also wants to cooperate with startups. „We’re looking for innovative ideas, especially for startups on the platform side, and want to use our Factory1 accelerator to gain a new perspective on our ideas,“ says Barbara. „In the accelerator, we evaluate whether it makes sense to integrate our system with theirs or vice versa.” Beyond the line of sight When vehicles begin to communicate with other cars and the infrastructure, things beyond humans capabilities become possible. „We are stretching an invisible safety net across the road,“ says Barbara. „This digital communication between cars goes further than the sensors built into the car itself.” Looking over the next hilltop, knowing what the weather is like on the other end of the tunnel, looking around corners – that’s V2X communication. „The car already knows that a vehicle is braking in front before a human driver would see the car’s brake lights in front“, says Barbara. A particularly appealing scenario: cars will know long before they arrive at the crossroad whether it will be green or red – and then can adjust their speed accordingly and catch the famous „green wave“. There is no obligation for car manufacturers to use the technology for V2X communication. In practice, this means that consumers will buy them as a bonus feature that offers more safety and comfort. It is also possible to upgrade older vehicles with small boxes that can send and receive data. Will we still need traffic lights in the future? Once all vehicles have been connected and „talk“ to each other, this will create a completely new street scene. „Communicating vehicles could then negotiate their own way through the crossroads,“ says Oliver. „Do we still need traffic lights to regulate traffic? Does a zebra crossing always have to be in the same place, or can it move digitally with people?” Cars will be able to communicate with pedestrians or cyclists on the road. Autonomous vehicles could use special lights to project zebra crossings onto the road or external displays to indicate that they are letting a person cross the street. „Yes, it is a great challenge to involve all road users in this communication,“ says Barbara. And here Kapsch technology comes into play again: „The infrastructure can, for example, detect pedestrians and pass this information on to the cars.” After all, V2X communication is there for one main thing: more safety on our roads.","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Connected_Cars_Matheus-Bertelli--644x362.jpg","15.
