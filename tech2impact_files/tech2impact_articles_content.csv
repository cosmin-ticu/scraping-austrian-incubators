Babett Kürschner People need to be aware that what they see on social media isn’t necessarily real.Nicole Chan, 22, on how edited social media posts can influence users’ self-esteem. The impact of social media on its users’ mental health has been a topic of interest for years but has become even more relevant in the midst of the current pandemic. As the usage of messenger apps and social media platforms is going up, tech founders can draw important conclusions for their own startups from studying the steps of established companies like Facebook when it comes to the impact of their technology on users’ well-being. For this week’s Responsible Tech Insights, we are focusing on the effects people’s online presence has on our life away from the screen. We spoke with Nicole Chan, who gathered an online following of close to 4,000 followers through showcasing her makeup looks. After grappling with the negative aspects of being a public persona, she decided to deactivate her account to take a two-year break from social media platforms. Nicole Chan, 22, is currently living in London, United Kingdom. Source: Instagram @whichnicole Let’s start at the beginning: what were your first experiences with social media platforms? My first experience with social media… I think I must have been eight when I registered on Facebook. Actually, it wasn’t even me who signed up, my mother created an account for me so she could add me as a friend. I didn’t use the platform until maybe a few years later. I was around twelve when I started posting quite frankly random pictures and status updates. It wasn’t anything like today where hundreds of “friends” see your posts, it was mostly family and people I knew in real life I was connected with anyways. It was a completely different time back then. Social media is an entirely other environment today. For example when I downloaded Instagram as a young teen I thought it was a photo editing app at first. The app was fairly new back then and I assumed the main feature was the filters you could apply to your images. What I didn’t know was that every time I edited and saved pictures, I was simultaneously posting them publicly on my profile. I only realised my feed was public after one of my friends eventually commented on one of my posts. It might seem silly now but that’s how much of an uncharted territory social media was back then. Ah, that’s tricky. Do you recall any other negative experiences? Well, as teenagers we started using messaging apps. MSN Messenger was very popular in Macau, an autonomous region on the south coast of China, which is where I’m from. But at one point some of us also registered on American dating websites, we must have been around thirteen at the time. We used fake profiles of course and were essentially trolling people, pretending to be somebody else. Looking back it was clearly reckless but none of us really thought it was dangerous at the time. We also had a “Gossip Girl” copycat in Macau. They anonymously posted private details in a very harsh way on their Facebook page, just like in the TV series. Even years later we don’t know who was behind the account, though my friends and I have a hunch. Thankfully I was never written about but a lot of my friends got mentioned. Their names were slightly changed but we all knew who the posts were about. There was a post about somebody I knew who had broken up with their boyfriend but ended up sleeping with his best friend. Very standard teenage drama. But it was posted publicly on Facebook, for everybody to see, the next day. It must have been incredibly humiliating for her, especially since somebody she knew well probably sent in the tip. This was a while ago and at this point, we’re using social media in a completely different way of course. Today I’d say we mainly see these platforms as a way to build our reputation and portray ourselves to others in a certain way. And a lot of times this environment can get quite toxic too, I’m not going to lie. We asked Nicole to edit one of tech2impact’s team members to demonstrate the stark contrast between altered and unaltered photos. Source: Babett KürschnerWhat features of social media contribute to this environment in your opinion? For me, I^d definitely say it’s the addictiveness of it. For example, when I meet people in real life and follow them on social media later, I keep checking if they follow me back and get a bit anxious if they don’t. It’s like some sort of stamp of approval. Did they really enjoy talking to me if they don’t follow me back? Actually, this is a good indicator of how seriously people take themselves online. If they follow me back instantly they’re usually great to communicate and connect with, they’re more carefree about their image online. But the ones who take their time tend to be more shallow and see it more from a cost-benefit perspective. It can be genuinely exhausting and experiences like these led me to decide to take down my profile for about two years. Could you tell me a bit more about the reasons behind shutting your account down? So, it was mostly the pressure to keep up with creating better and better content. I was constantly trying to one-up myself, even though I’m not even an influencer with hundreds of thousands of followers. I felt under pressure and it simply wasn’t enjoyable anymore. I got incredibly fed up with it. I switched to using an account where I only followed my closest fifty friends. I hardly posted anything there, it was mainly to keep in touch with them. At first, a lot of people didn’t understand why I would deactivate my account if I had a lot of followers but it was never about that, metrics didn’t actually matter to me. But you re-activated your account again, right? What has changed in your approach to social media since then? Yes, I did. At this point when I scroll through my feed and see other people’s perfect bodies it doesn’t matter to me anymore. I’m way less likely to be negatively influenced by it because I gained perspective and know that what I’m seeing online probably isn’t real anyways. I use apps like FaceTune, I know how to get the perfect body, the perfect face. One swipe here, one swipe there… Speaking of, I actually edit my photos way less than I used to too. I started feeling more confident about my body. Nowadays I only add a subtle natural filter with a skin-smoothing feature and maybe slim my jaw a bit. Models on billboards have been edited by professional photographers for decades. The only difference now is that it’s relatively easy to access and use these editing tools. “A lot of times makeup looks just won’t show up on camera without editing.” Source: Instagram @whichnicoleWhat’s your take on photo editing apps like FaceTune in general? I think it’s important for users to know how widely these filters are used on social media nowadays. I have a disclaimer on my profile where I clearly state how edited my pictures are. The way I look in my posts isn’t how I actually look. But if you don’t know that’s the case, you’re bound to compare yourself to an unrealistic beauty standard. I’ve had friends come up to me to tell me that they deleted Instagram because it made them feel horrible. It made them think they needed to drastically change their looks and it really wasn’t healthy for them. But online platforms shouldn’t have such a negative influence on their users. You should open an app and feel motivated or happy, not insecure about yourself. Anything else you’d like to say to wrap up our conversation? I think people need to be aware that everything they see online is very superficial. What they see online isn’t necessarily real. Everybody’s putting out the best version of themselves, nobody’s an exception. If you look at your own profile you’re most likely creating a curated picture for others to see. At the end of the day what matters most when you use these platforms is how you feel afterwards. Social media should make you feel good. It should be used to connect with people, to raise awareness of important issues, to keep in touch with friends from all over the world. Technology should add something positive to your life. Period. Because if it doesn’t, what’s the point of using it in the first place?

"2","https://tech2impact.com/connecting-the-unconnected/","Tech2Impact","Connecting the unconnected"," Connecting the unconnected “Let’s create something valuable.” Jorge Rios Bridgefy Born in Mexico Living in USA Focus: Digital Divide Tech: SDK Jorge met his co-founders at an international hackathon in a team, where they together represented Mexico. As they were the only team not having access to wifi, on the way to the hackathon, they came up with the idea of building a product – an app – that will work without the internet. A few years later, this idea became a company called Bridgefy. What is Bridgefy? Bridgefy is connecting the unconnected by providing companies with software that makes mobile apps work without the internet. We license our software to companies and they can integrate it into their mobile apps and the end-users then simply can use those without the internet. The way it works is instead of using the internet, we connect devices using Bluetooth and thus allow for a regional and national network. With Bluetooth, you can connect over 150 meters and by hopping on other devices, we can also connect over larger distances. It’s basically a chain of devices that allows for communication without having access to the internet. Everything is secure and Bluetooth is also very energy efficient. In which parts of the world is your app used mostly? Or on which occasions? Right now we are trending in India, because of the Kashmir conflicts. Last year, we were trending in Mexico City because of the earthquake and then in Iran and Hong Kong because of the political protests. These are some examples, but I would say that generally when people know that they’re going to be in a large event, that’s when they think of Bridgefy. And it’s not only for political events but also for music festivals. We have a lot of download spikes whenever there’s going to be a large music festival, like Coachella. What about regions with generally bad access, like some rural areas, is this an area of interest? It definitely is. We actually met with the United Nations this year and we hope to be starting several projects with them in which we help people in the developing regions. We know that we can promote economic and social development with our technology. If people are able to buy or sell things, have a network for logistics or receive educational content – this can make the difference and boost development. We can provide people with this infrastructure in an accessible and easy way and we know that we can make a difference. So we’re really excited about what’s going to happen in this regard. What is your connection to the Sustainable Development Goals? Bridgefy’s technology addresses multiple development goals, including the reduction of poverty, the creation of infrastructure and to boost economic growth. If we create this network and provide people with tools, then it will allow them to address several problems. We’re not focused on just one goal, we’re focused on providing people with the infrastructure to solve as many problems as possible. This includes doing a better job or finding a job, being able to participate in commerce, receive educational content, and staying safe during natural disasters or a refugee camp. That’s why we’re really convinced we are a perfect partner for the United Nations, as the majority of their agenda is aligned with ours. What do you think is or was your biggest challenge as a founder? This year, the biggest challenge was adapting to all the COVID-19 changes. Now people don’t go to events or protests, so downloads went down significantly. We had to learn, investigate, and adapt to this and find new ways of managing the company. We saw that we can’t just keep depending on large events, as they won’t be happening anytime soon. Our biggest problem still is that many people, especially with a privileged background, don’t believe that this is a problem we’re trying to solve. They don’t know that so many people need access to means of communication. They think that everybody has access to the internet, always, because they do. That’s something that we’re constantly trying to educate people on. We have to raise awareness so that people understand how important and how needed this is for everybody. What do you love most about being the founder of Bridgefy? My favorite thing is to get feedback from the app users, especially when they say things like “Thanks to this app, I was able to go to this concert and I lost my girlfriend and I found her again” or “Thanks to this app, l could find my family, after the Mexico City earthquake”. When receiving this feedback, I’m getting that sense of actually helping people and this is definitely my favorite part. What was your best moment as a founder? I would say convincing Biz Stone, one of the Twitter founders, to invest in Bridgefy. He is the high technology world superstar and has already built several million dollar companies and is invested in Slack, Square, and many more. Convincing somebody important is a really cool experience. I like counting on him as one of our investors and one of our advisors. What is also very important to me is being able to build a team that I like working with every day and being able to keep that team. Do you have some established habits or routines with your team to have a good team culture? Yes. Every day we check-in at 9 am on Slack to know how everybody is doing and if anyone needs help with anything. I also encourage my team to be honest and say if they don’t feel like it. Everyone should be able to express it and not having to hide anything. Some days you just simply don’t want to work and that’s totally okay, we’re humans, we’re adults. Another thing we do at least once a week is having a face to face meeting to check on how the person is doing. That’s not so much about the job, because we talk the whole week about the job. It’s more about questions like “How are you? How’s your family? How are you feeling? Is there anything you need?” You know, taking care of the human part of the company is very important. Generally, I would say a lot of communication and honesty is the key. Did you establish any habits or routines for yourself as a founder? Yes. I learned that listening to your body and paying attention to your mind is very important. You can’t just keep working 14 hours a day, every day. If your body is asking you to rest, eat, sleep, or to simply stop thinking about work, you have to listen to it. Because in the long run it will accumulate and you can be seriously affected. You should never sacrifice your well-being for a company. Yes, you have to put all of your heart into it and you have to put all of your attention to it if you can, but not to the point where you can affect yourself on a personal basis. That’s just not worth it. What is your advice for future founders? So, in my opinion, there are two types of founders: the ones building companies to get money and the others to create value. The founders that create companies to make money don’t always succeed, but if you create value, then you are doing exactly the right thing to then earn money. If you create value for different people, organizations, companies or governments, then it’s much easier to make money once you’ve become an essential part of their lives/work. Whereas if you only create a company to make money, then yes, of course, you can be successful and of course, you could do it, but there are easier and faster ways of getting rich than building a tech startup. If you create value, then wealth will follow. So, let’s create something valuable.

"3","https://tech2impact.com/from-science-fiction-to-life-sustaining-organs/","Tech2Impact","From science fiction to life-sustaining organs"," From science fiction to life-sustaining organs “I am totally convinced that this technology is going to be normal in a decade or two.” Lutz Kloke Cellbricks Born in Germany Living in Germany Focus: Health Tech: Bioprinting Lutz is by training a pharmacist, but by some weird coincidence he ended up doing his Ph.D. in tissue engineering. The work on his thesis made him go deeper into the topic and finding his passion for bioprinting. After finishing his thesis he was sold on the idea of printing implantable material and providing bioimplants. So he turned his hobby and interests into a company – Cellbricks. What is Cellbricks? Our mission is to solve the organ donor shortage by bioprinting transplants. We have developed a new bioprinting technology that allows us to create complex three-dimensional structures made of biopolymers and cells. With this, we can produce organ-models, living 3D cell cultures, and scaffolds. Additionally, we are also aiming to empower researchers to investigate functional human tissues for fundamental biological research or advanced regenerative therapies. How did you come up with the idea of Cellbricks? It’s basically the same startup story like with everybody else: you start with a hobby/field of interest and make it your primary work – or at least this is how I ended up with Cellbricks. After my Ph.D. thesis, I had nothing, I just had my degree. If I would have gone to the banks and told them “look, I want to do bioprinting because I think this is the future and we are gonna print organs or transplants” I wouldn’t have gotten any funding. But the good thing is that the German government gives funding to deep tech ideas that you want to commercialize. So, in 2015 I started with Cellbricks and in 2016 I was able to found the legal entity. Since then we are working as a bioprinting company, selling printed products and working as a collaborator for academia, hospitals, and for the industry. We basically build them their individual 3-dimensional models. That’s the short story of how Cellbricks started and we grew ever since – we started off with three people in 2015 and right now we are 15. But honestly, that’s the question I get always asked and it’s the hardest one to answer. The weird part is that I am just totally convinced that this technology is going to be normal in a few years or a decade. This science-fiction idea of going to the doctor and he/she is going to print an organ or life material and implant it into your body will be reality sooner or later. Also, we will get used to the fact that it’s better to create something new than to implant plastic or material that is derived from animals. I am entirely sold on that idea, but it’s hard to explain how I came up with it at the very beginning. I worked in the field, and to me, it was obvious that 3D printing would advance to printing biological material, and if I wouldn’t do it, somebody else would do it. I guess it kinda grows with you when you work in the field and you get passionate about it, right? Did you ever plan to found a company? How is it to be a founder? I actually decided to found a company because it was the only way to keep working in the field after my PhD. Now I’m my own boss, I can decide how we move and I love this. But on the other hand, I still need to focus on getting money, so basically, the economic situation is my boss (laughs). This means that I cannot really completely freely decide where to go because I’m also responsible to get revenue. As a founder, there are many fields to take care of – building up a company, developing the technology, finding customers, getting revenue, and so on. You have to balance the company between economic and scientific growth – we cannot act as a pure R&D company, as we are an economic entity that sells its products. What was your best moment and biggest learning as a founder until now? I guess there is no specific “best moment”. It just makes me really happy whenever I think of our journey and remember where we came from and what we have accomplished so far. It’s a good feeling. And my biggest learning I would say was to learn to say “No” to people or projects in order to stay focused. Where do you see Cellbricks in 5 years from now? In 5 years I want us to be an established player in the field of regenerative medicine via bioprinting. That is basically the goal I’m looking towards. I want us to grow into a company that is on the one hand advancing science (especially in drug development) and on the other hand, is exploring the way on how we can use the technology to speed up regenerative medicine. What do you think in which timeframe is it realistic to have 3D printed organs? It’s hard to estimate how long it will take. Due to regulations, it will take a while – especially life-sustaining organs like a beating heart or liver. It’s not like you are allowed to implant something into the body just because you can print it, there are a lot of regulations and this is good. You need to pass many tests before and this will take years to decades. I don’t have a clear date for when there will be the first life-sustaining organ ready to be implanted. But implantable material, which is not life-sustaining, I think this will take place sooner. So to conclude, to implant a printed beating heart will still take time, but there will be devices or material that will be implanted for sure in this decade.

"4","https://tech2impact.com/improvement-of-lives-as-an-imperative/","Tech2Impact","Improvement of lives as an imperative"," Improvement of lives as an imperative “The best moments are always when someone’s life improves by using your product” Louis Zantema Reducept Born in The Netherlands Living in The Netherlands Focus: Chronic Pain Tech: Virtual Reality Louis Zantema is a Doctor of Psychology and most likely the only specialist whose aim is to make himself dispensable as a therapist. His company Reducept unites his passion for gaming with his passion for improving his patients’ lives through evidence based psychological and educational interventions, redesigned for Virtual Reality. What is Reducept and how was the idea born? Reducept is a non-medical virtual reality therapy for people with chronic pain. I worked as a psychologist in hospitals for many years, mainly in chronic pain wards. I met my Co-Founder Margryt Fennema at The Medical Center Leeuwarden and we started out by identifying what type of patients are running into difficulties at the hospital. Margryt and I realised that if there’s a group that’s really hard to treat, it’s victims of chronic pain. There are so many people who suffer from it and it’s not really a well-known issue in wider society. 40% of all loss of work worldwide is due to lower back pain. That’s huge! What we noticed when we spoke with patients is that a lot of them had a really similar disease pattern. Most people with chronic pain we spoke to didn’t have physical reasons for their pain. They found it really hard to grasp why they were hurting and how to move forward with their therapy because they were sort of at the last stop. In most cases, medication or surgery didn’t help anymore. Margryt and I saw this really big group of people with a problem that was hard to solve, so we decided to do something about it. How did you come up with your approach? Well, we did a lot of testing and experimented with offering therapeutic exercises and education on websites, in apps – and eventually in virtual reality too. The interesting thing about VR is that it captivates its users and we were quite astonished that this was the case even for chronic pain patients, who usually struggle with their attention span due to the medication they take. After noticing that it was much easier for them to learn and grasp things in VR we got really excited and other people got excited too, which is how we managed to raise our first round of funds and subsidies to create the prototype. We had some ideas on what types of exercises to implement. I was treating patients with chronic pain at the hospital so I knew from experience what tactics worked especially well. But in-person treatment is an incredibly slow process. It would take me 15 or 20 hours to have one patient, well, up and running so to speak. After a lot of positive feedback for our prototype from patients we started to raise more money through startup competitions, other subsidies and an investor. Our MVP was ready by September last year and Reducept launched as a B2B business in the Netherlands. Could you walk us through one of the VR exercises? We’re applying a lot of different mental strategies that could help patients to cope with their pain. All of our exercises have different theoretical backgrounds. There’s an exercise where you first choose the spot where you feel pain, enter your own nervous system and “shoot” at your own pain, the gamification aspect here is really important. This exercise will actually influence the part of your brain that is responsible for creating that pain in the first place. Just by doing this exercise and sort of “tricking” their brain, our patients’ pain scores drop and stay low for a long period of time. We also have relaxation and cognitive exercises and we’re working towards adding mindfulness activities to train patients to not focus on their pain all the time. What is it like being a founder for you? I think I’d describe myself as an “unintentional founder”. I was really happy with working as a psychologist but then this opportunity came along. Helping patients through Reducept gave me so much energy that I decided to just go with it. To be honest, I don’t think being a founder is more or less special than running a business or being a freelancer. I’m still doing something that is related to psychology, even though it is completely different from being a psychologist at a hospital. You can create an impact in so many different ways and it’s up to you to decide how you want to do it. What were your biggest challenges and your best moments so far? Biggest challenge… That’s a hard one. I think the biggest challenge was finding the right people to work with. We have a team of 14 and finding the right people doesn’t only mean finding somebody with the right skill set but also with the right focus and dedication. This also applies to investors and other stakeholders, everybody needs to have the same goal in mind.In the long run, we wouldn’t want investors to conflict with our purpose for example. Investors are always looking to make money and money is nice, don’t get me wrong! But it shouldn’t be the biggest focus of your company. The best moments are always when someone’s life improves by using your product after all. Luckily we have many of these moments. We sometimes get emails from patients, one even published a whole article in a patient magazine detailing how our technology helped them. Things like these are what drive us, it’s still sort of a surprise sometimes but it never gets old. Do you have any habits that help you stay on top of things? Yeah, I think it’s really important to prioritize tasks when you build your company. It’s really easy to get caught up in doing things that don’t actually benefit your end goal. So if you’re stuck and don’t have time to work on and improve your product anymore, you should take a look at your processes and find out what’s hindering you from moving forward. Focus is super important, you have to decide what has to be done and what your priorities are for example. In my case, I often ask myself if what I’m doing helps someone with chronic pain or not in the long run. For example, I feel like writing blog posts is sort of a drag and it might be easier to put it off and call somebody from our team to discuss stuff about MailChimp instead. Think of what helps develop your purpose. In my case, it’s creating content so I’d be better off focusing on that. Is this also something that’s reflected in your company culture? Yes definitely, I think we’re really focused as a group. The most important aspect about our team is that everybody really wants to help our end-user – people with chronic pain. It’s the same for our clients too. They buy Reducept because they want to improve their own pain or want to treat their patients, not necessarily to make money fast. Of course, you can profit from Reducept but if you work in healthcare it’s primarily about improving the lives of people. All startups in this industry care about doing research and improving medical technology to some extent. Where do you see yourself and Reducept in the next three years? I hope that in a couple of years we’ll be known as the best online treatment for chronic pain worldwide. I also think that utilising VR definitely has its limits and I’m curious what the future is going to hold for our treatments’ integrations in augmented reality and smartphone devices. Do you have any advice for founders that are at the very beginning of their journey? I think the best advice is still to find a group that really has a need, you can read up on this in many books. Create something completely different and don’t just improve an existing product or service. Find a gap you can fill and identify your target audience. I would also advise everybody to really think about their organisational goals and make sure they are truly worth striving for. If you want to do something for many years you have to find value in it, otherwise I believe it won’t work. In my opinion one of the things you should also really be focusing on as a startup is trying to sell the product you have as soon as possible. Last year we did a lot of pre-sales based on our prototype, we went to practices and told them about its potential. I know that some startups are less focused on sales and more focused on getting more subsidies and funding. It’s a shame because if you test out the saleability of your product too late, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to get feedback from your customers from an early stage. Do you have any recommendations for our readers? “The Courage To Be Disliked” by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi and most stuff from Seth Godin, especially his podcast or book. He’s all about purpose as well. It’s about making slow progress instead of applying some magic trick and believing you can instantly change your habits and achieve success.

"5","https://tech2impact.com/sdg-3-good-health-and-well-being-using-tech-to-drive-global-health-forward/","Tech2Impact","SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being: Using Tech to Drive Global Health Forward"," SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being: Using Tech to Drive Global Health Forward Sarah Klimt tech2impact On the occasion of World Health Day, this year’s theme focuses on building a fairer and healthier world. Indeed, the COVID-19 continues to be a challenge for humanity, but it has also revealed deeper underlying issues, namely the inequalities in global health. There is no doubt that the pandemic’s impact has adversely affected all of us, especially those who have already been vulnerable before the crisis are facing the brunt of the pandemic. Vulnerability comes in all forms, such as inadequate access to, or lack of, healthcare services and factors outside the health sector. Low income, lack of safe environments, clean water, nutritious food, and many more, can also affect good health adversely. Truly, the crisis has shown how an individual’s socio-economic background plays a decisive role in accessing healthcare services. For this reason, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is urging leaders to tackle such inequalities by: Encouraging a bottom-up approach, promoting collaborative work between affected communities and the governments to tackle inequalities collectively.Collecting reliable health data, which in turn allows for better decision-making, making sure that taken actions have an impact.Ensuring that the governmental approach addresses the root cause of inequities and direct funds in primary healthcare.Enhancing international mechanisms to guarantee equitable access to vaccines, tests, and treatments.Implications of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Good Health and Well-Being Looking at the global progress of the Sustainable Development Goal 3 across critical areas such as child health, maternal health, HIV, immunisations have been compelling. The last two decades have seen an improvement in reducing neonatal deaths, under 5-child mortalities and reduced maternal mortalities (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 (Source: WHO Statistics) However, COVID-19 continues to threaten existing healthcare systems and discourage routine health check-ups with catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, current emphasis needs to be directed towards accelerating global health to counteract the adverse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. “According to a recent study, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased, the increase in child and maternal deaths could be devastating: 118 low- and middle-income countries could see an increase of 9.8 to 44.8% in under-5 deaths per month and an 8.3 to 38.6% rise in maternal deaths per month, over a period of six months.”SDG Progress Report 2020 Also, around 70 countries have halted their childhood immunisation programs due to the pandemic. WHO statistics indicate a global increase in non-transmissible diseases, like diabetes, regardless of whether it is an emerging or established economy, leading to the majority of global deaths per year. In this sense, promoting the uptake of technology can be an essential force to target the eroding state of healthcare systems caused by the pandemic. Let’s take a closer look at it in the next section. Uptake of Technology to Make Healthcare Accessible Virtual health applications have been made available for more than a decade ago. But their uptake has been relatively slow in the healthcare industry. Due to the pandemic, more investments have gone into virtual health technologies, thus challenging traditional approaches. In terms of investment, in 2019, digital health was a global market of around $350 billion. Virtual health applicationshave been categorised across three categories: telehealth, digital therapeutics, and care navigation. Research suggests that virtual health applications are bound to receive increased investments, with remote monitoring being a prominent focus area for future investments (Figure 2). Figure 2 (Source: McKinsey, 2020)It is not surprising that virtual health adoption is receiving more attention as their applications create opportunities such as: Offering new high-quality services to patients, especially for elderly patients and those patients suffering from chronic illnesses. Findings suggest that virtual health is perceived to be a convenient and cost-effective way to access healthcare services.Accessing new markets across different geographical areas – for example, extending healthcare services to rural areas.Our tech2impact ecosystem startups use diverse tech approaches, from robotics, telehealth to digital platforms and many more to enable SDG 3. SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being in the tech2impact ecosystem Tendo (SE) – Exoskeleton that allows paralyzed users to grip and release objects Tendo focuses on developing robotic assistive devices for individuals who experience disabilities due to injuries or diseases. Their product, also known as an exoskeleton, resembles a glove. It allows individuals to grasp, carry, and drop objects. The device enhances patients’ quality of life by tackling their movement limitations, enabling them to achieve independence in their day-to-day routines. If you are inspired by Tendo’s innovation, you can learn more about their journey by reading our interview with them here. Pons (US) – a wearable ultrasound device for pre-hospital diagnostics Pons offers a wearable ultrasound device for prehospital diagnostics. The AI-enabled device is an example of how healthcare may be decentralised and democratised, allowing doctors to extend their services to individuals via remote diagnosis and real-time monitoring. Their approach is cost-effective and especially relevant for rural communities in developing and developed countries that lack adequate access to healthcare services. Takestep (EG) – Platform for the addiction recovery process Takestep is committed to empowering individuals by connecting them with a medical professional. This is done through an online platform in a seamless way, giving individuals the opportunity to recover from addiction. Pocketcoach (AUT) – Digital coach for people who struggle with anxiety Pocketcoach is a digital self-help tool helping people with anxiety issues. Their cost-effective approach is based on therapy approaches supported by science and makes mental health support more accessible. MJN Neuroserveis (ES) – Improve the quality of life of people with epilepsy MJN Neuro is committed to enhancing the life quality of individuals who have epilepsy. With their earpiece device “mjn-SERAS” which is embedded with AI, users and their trusted contacts receive a warning sign when they are at high risk of facing epileptic seizures. PEGASI (CL) – Smart management of Healthcare information PEGASI offers medical software that connects different health sector stakeholders. It creates an ecosystem for digitised health information in a secure, accessible, and transparent way. The platform provides an integrated teleconsultation option, which, together with the other features, allows for better engagement between patients and doctors. The need for responsible tech to avoid amplifying inequalities As much as technology is needed to drive global health forward, the role of responsible technology to avoid pitfalls can’t be understated. This year’s World Health Day theme, building a fairer and healthier world, can be achieved with the help of digital health technologies. The general consensus highlights the role of technologies enabling better healthcare access to marginalised or rural communities, the elderly, and those suffering from chronic illnesses. However, a critical aspect to consider is not to fall into the trap of believing technology alone will advance health equity. First, we need to take the complex socio-economic and socio-cultural structures and other factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender into consideration before developing technological solutions. Second, we then need to provide a technological solution that does not overlook these aspects and include them in their strategic and planning processes. For example, not recognising a contextual factor such as the problem of race blind data across digital health applications, can leads to systematic discrimination in digital healthcare services. Context is key – in life and in Good Health and Well-Being Essentially, the aim is to use tech to empower all patients and not exacerbate existing inequities in the health sector. We can succeed in this aim by placing importance on contextual analysis. An approach that helps to understand the importance of local knowledge is to use community-based participatory research. In this respect, scholars have highlighted the importance of involving marginalised communities, researchers, and tech innovators by advocating for community engagement practices. At tech2impact, we are keen to promote tech with a purpose. Together, with the Institute for Technological Ethics, we have developed the Responsible Tech Assessment. The test allows you to identify and position your startup across different areas such as business and technological ethics, health, social, and democratic risks within the larger network of social-cultural understanding. To gain in-depth insights on your performance across the listed areas make sure to take the assessment.

Least of all social networks that deliberately try to attract users that have been banned or shunned on other platforms due to their disruptive and counterproductive behaviour. We’re talking about Parler, a so-called alt-tech platform whose star fell as quickly as it rose in 2020. Initially, the platform proclaimed to be a “safe space” (or rather echo chamber) where users could express their opinions without regulations or censorship. But Parler fell victim to social risks that have afflicted the fate of many other alternative social networks across all political and ideological spectrums: anti-social behaviour and hijacking by bad actors. While Parler, a hotbed for xenophobia, antisemitism and right-wing extremism, might not be a prime example of technology acting responsibly towards society, there is a lot to be learned from its struggle to prevent diminishing trust and confidence in their product. Parler is imploding. pic.twitter.com/tmfk52666q— Parlertakes<U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> (@parlertakes) December 14, 2020An example of the content that can be found on Parler. Source: Twitter (@parlertakes)Sounds interesting but what exactly is Parler? Parler is “a non-biased free speech-driven entity” founded by two computer scientists, John Matze and Jared Thomson. It received its funding from angel investors like the prominent conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, as it doesn’t display any ads and is not profitable as of now. From a UX standpoint, it’s similar to Twitter with posts that can be shared (or “echoed”), rated and commented on. Its mission statement to “enable productive, polite discourse among people with differing interests, life experiences, and viewpoints” is in strong contrast to Parlor’s active users, who are overwhelmingly right-leaning and to some extent radicalised. The network is most popular in the Americas, the U.S. and Brazil to be more specific. However, it had initially caught on in the Middle East and in Europe too. At one point, conservative members of the British parliament romped about alongside anti-government extremists and QAnon conspiracy theorists. Parler is often mentioned in the same breath as other alt-tech platforms that cater to right-wing communities such as 4chan. Why did it become so popular then? The emergence of alternative social media networks is fueled by users’ increasing dissatisfaction with existing platforms. The messaging app Telegram gained popularity by explicitly emphasising its focus on privacy and data encryption features, that WhatsApp is reportedly struggling to implement. In a similar way, Parler saw a steep increase in user registrations after Twitter changed its policy towards the tweets of the current U.S. President Donald Trump. While adding a flair about disputed facts seems like a drop in the ocean of stopping the spread of misinformation to some, to others this was enough to boycott the platform and switch to Parler – at least temporarily. Its community guidelines are fairly short. They emphasise Parler’s minimal involvement in monitoring and removing content, something that definitely appealed to an audience disgruntled by their perceived censorship through bigger tech companies. The chronological layout of users’ feeds was seen as a positive contrast to sometimes untransparent algorithms of other platforms that favour certain posts without any real explanation. Creators on platforms such as Instagram accuse the tech giant of bias and censorship every time a new algorithm update is rolled out. By displaying posts in the exact order they were released Parler tried to circumvent this issue.. I can’t get past the captcha! Anyone know a fix? Beyond frustrating..I’ve tried on iPhone, pc and the app <U+0001F92C>A quote from a disgruntled Parler user who struggles with some of its features. Source: “Who Is Moving To Parler?” Facebook group So, where did it go wrong? Firstly, proclaiming oneself as a safe haven for individuals who have been banned from conventional social networking sites due to their breach of community guidelines set the tone for the type of discourse to come. Secondly, Parler fell victim to something tech2impact and The Institute of Technological Ethics describe as “social risks”: the consequences of bad actors using technology in unintended and harmful ways. There are 2 key social risks that lead users to turn away from alternative social networks, including Parler. Anti-social behaviour One of the main reasons Parler has taken a hit with its user base is the various reports of high-profile QAnon figures being impersonated on the platform. QAnon is a (disproven) far-right conspiracy theory, driven by anonymous leaders who post regular “updates” on fringe websites. An administrator of one of these websites has publicly spoken out about Parler, as somebody had created a verified profile on his behalf, pretending to be him. Another example was the fake profile of right-wing English media personality Katie Hopkins. After she was banned from Twitter for violating their policies, an account claiming to be Hopkins was set up and quickly verified on Parler. This account went on to raise $500 for a supposed lawsuit against Twitter that was of course fabricated. The CEO of Parler ended up publicly apologizing and verifying the real Katie Hopkins himself, but at that point, users had already begun to become suspicious of the platform. Bad actors & hijacking Letting misinformation and conspiracy theories spread might have been one of the core USPs of Parler. But the same practices that were put in place to “ensure free speech” (i.e. not using algorithms but volunteers to filter content) lead Parler to be susceptible to third parties utilising the platform for their own gains. Reportedly, the platform is an easy target for the spam of pornographic material of actors using the site to promote their own services. Mechanisms that should disable auto-play of videos seem to not always work, which leads to users being confronted with graphic imagery they might not necessarily want to see. Another example: MeWe, a different alt-tech network is currently grappling with the hijacking of their platform by gun and drug dealers. Their mission statement was to give “the power of the internet back to the people”. Hey @GregAbbott_TX! This dude is saying stuff on Parler. <U+270C><U+FE0F> pic.twitter.com/guvMdDJMQW— Parlertakes<U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8> (@parlertakes) December 14, 2020A conservative politician campaigning on Parler. Source: Twitter (@parlertakes)With that being said, what are the implications of all this for tech founders? Technology founders who set out to create alternative social media platforms amongst the quasi-monopolists Facebook, YouTube and Twitter need to be extremely careful to not create something even more harmful. Creating an environment that adds value and not harm to their users lives can be a tightrope to walk. The implications of social risks are detrimental to users’ wellbeing, self-esteem and mental health. While bigger companies like Apple and Microsoft have their fair share of controversies with regards to this, their operations are more robust due to size and experience. Startups’ reputation and performance on the other hand can be heavily affected by even just one incident. Without taking social risks into account, tech companies are vulnerable to anti-social behavior and bad actors that can taint the experience of their users. When it comes to Parler, these and other factors are leading to the erosion of meaningful interaction and a drastic slowdown of their growth (which definitely isn’t a bad thing, all things considered). But regardless of Parler’s twisted business model and mission statement from the get-go, there are valuable lessons to be learned for startup founders about the need to plan ahead for social risks of all sorts.

"7","https://tech2impact.com/tackling-climate-change-with-big-data/","Tech2Impact","Tackling climate change with big data"," Tackling climate change with big data “I think we are just at the beginning of a massive revolution” Lubomila Jordanova Plan A Born in Bulgaria Living in Germany Focus: Climate Action Tech: Big Data Lubomila is the founder of Plan A, an impact tech startup that uses big data to tackle climate change. Doing this wasn’t always her plan at all. Lubomila has always been working in finance, first in investment banking, then in VC, and afterwards in a FinTech start-up in London. But something happened that changed her focus and career path a bit. How did you get involved with sustainability, climate change, and Plan A? A few years back, I went on a trip to Morocco, to explore the best places for surfing. This trip was definitely an eye-opening experience. I expected to see beautiful places to surf, but everything was really polluted, mostly covered in plastic. For the first time my eyes were open to the negative impact we, humans, had on our planet. After this experience I got back to London and started to dig deeper into the topic of pollution and climate change, spending all my free time for the next 6 months educating myself on climate change and the correlation it had to pollution through online courses, books, and scientific papers. The knowledge I accumulated showed me that the situation worldwide was actually much worse than what was communicated across channels. My next step was to conduct a vast survey with 300 people and 100 companies to understand the behaviors and opinions about climate change. This was the final straw. After this I was beyond convinced that addressing climate change needed a different approach. I quit my job and founded Plan A. How did all of this reflect on your personal life? I changed a lot in my daily life. Firstly, I have stopped taking any kind of transportation – I take my bike everywhere. Moreover, I don’t eat meat for 5 years now and I don’t eat processed products that are processed. Last but not least, I haven’t bought new clothes in the last 4 years. Ever since I started working on Plan A, I have so much respect for what nature gives us and her intelligence. This has helped me live a very minimalistic life – I don’t really have materialistic needs anymore. Somehow during this whole journey of consumerism, we ended up developing unnecessary needs for owning items. I can comfortably say I am beyond this. It’s quite shocking when you see the statistics on how many items an average person buys per year. So, what is Plan A? Plan A has developed the first Carbon Reduction Software which helps businesses calculate, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint monthly, while automatically building each month a tailored sustainability action plan and offsetting schemes, according to the footprint of the company. The technology behind the software uses insights from the Plan A algorithm which analyses over 300,000 data points to predict and prioritize the most critical environmental issues and the way industries and companies impact these environmental changes. For us, data has been very important since day one, as our fundamental basis is to respect the facts. I have made sure that we follow scientific principles and all the work that we do follows what the climate data science field has taught us. What was your best moment as a founder until now? There are so many! The first team member, our first event, our first “thank you” email, our first corporate client. In the last 6 months, the most exciting was the response to our software release. After we released the product, we had a waiting list of 300 companies within a few weeks. This was the proof that people and the companies where they worked were waking up to the urgency of climate change. What more would a Greentech startup dedicated to the reduction of emissions want? Do you think that being an impact founder is more challenging? I generally think that being an impact founder and any other entrepreneur involves the same activities and entrepreneurial challenges. You need to build a solid structure, a good team, set some tests to understand what your customers want, and develop an amazing offering people love. As long as there is a business model that allows the company to sustain itself, and to grow on a long-term basis, then the challenge for an impact and another tech startup is the same. One of the unique features of any impact startup is the dedication to the purpose of the company. Finding a topic that is bigger than you, bigger than a software, bigger than a life, makes you significantly more driven and also long-term dedicated. I feel incredibly honoured to be working on fighting climate change and would hope that one day every single business on this planet has the capacity to choose their own cause. Mine is climate change. I think it is important to start talking more about that because when you are building something for impact, people often think you are building an NGO or it’s something that won’t scale. It’s still not properly perceived as a proper business and this is visible in investment patterns and in opportunities of acceleration for companies – this image of impact business unfortunately still needs to be changed in people’s’ mindsets. Do you have any advice for (future) founders? Be curiousI’m not sure how I would’ve built Plan A without the constant need of feeding my brain with new content, knowledge, and facts. Be impatientNormally this is not considered to be a positive skill, but in my case it helped me to have a sense of urgency. Anyone fighting climate change or any other big issues should work with a sense of urgency. Be positivePositivity has this creative power to engage people, get them excited and active. If you need help or want your startup to succeed, put a smile on your face, and work on a daily basis with positivity. It moves mountains. Be balancedMaking sure that your head is clear is very important. I personally achieve this through yoga and meditation. It’s something that sets my day off in a way that I have a mind that can manage many tasks at the same time and a body that supports the intense work schedule. Be with a good teamI think if I would have been doing this by myself, I probably wouldn’t be as motivated. It would feel like fighting a battle on my own – and it’s a big battle, which you need good people for. What’s next? At the moment, companies are in a big existential crisis, as with the urgency of climate change and embedding new sustainable business flows, the companies need to reshuffle completely on how they are used to make business. We definitely see shifts and baby steps being made, but there is still a lot that needs to happen, as we are just at the beginning of a massive revolution I would say. Our mission in this revolution is to help companies to reduce their emissions, as our number one goal has always been climate action. We want to generate the biggest impact through helping thousands of companies learn how to embed sustainability into their existence Big agenda ahead, but we are beyond driven to see it through.

"8","https://tech2impact.com/technology-design-prevent-biases-from-determining-business-decisions/","Tech2Impact","Technology Design: How to prevent biases from determining your business decisions"," Technology Design: How to prevent biases from determining your business decisions Babett Kürschner After discussing the implications of socio-cultural understanding and business ethics, we’re going into the details of the Responsible Technology Assessment’s third key pillar this week: technology design. We’re delving into how mental shortcuts can influence your decision making and technology design in particular. Read on if you want to find out why this is especially relevant for tech startups, hear about concrete examples of business’ unintentional design flaws and learn what things you need to consider when coming up with your product or design! What is technology design? Coming up with a technological solution to your customers’ problems is a process. From identifying the problem to determining the best way to move forward, from creating the MVP to finally launching it after a lot of trial and error – there are many decisions you and your team have to make along the way. While it is obvious that technology design depends on the practical skills of the individual(s) who are developing it, the fact that individual beliefs, attitudes and behaviours have an equally great impact on the final outcome is often overlooked. Does this mean technology design is inherently biased? The short answer: yes. The long answer: most likely not on purpose, but still yes. Our individual experiences shape each of us into the person we are today, which distinctly influence every decision we make. This means that two individuals who are given the same set of information and confronted with the same choices can make profoundly different decisions based on their past experiences. This is due to the fact that our brain stores acquired knowledge as mental shortcuts, so called “building blocks”. This enables us to make decisions relatively quickly instead of having to rely on our brain’s processing power to ponder on every single action too long. This can be useful in everyday situations, like shopping for groceries for example. Instead of being paralysed by the sheer amount of choice we can buy a roll of paper towels with relative ease. But these shortcuts are often unconsciously used when making more important decisions too, which means we’re prone to fall back on consolidated stereotypes and biases that might not hold up under closer examination. Why is it important for tech startups? If you want to create the best version of your product or service, you need to make conscious, deliberate decisions during the technology design process. This is easier said than done when you’re dealing with unconscious beliefs and attitudes that you might not even be aware of. Nipping bias in the bud before it profoundly affects your technology is important if you want to come up with a final result that doesn’t accidentally turn off its intended target audience. What aspects of my technology do I need to give special attention to? There are different aspects of both hardware and software that run the risk of including unwanted partisan beliefs. Here are four elements that tech2impact and The Institute of Technological Ethics consider particularly significant for tech startup founders: Data collection Big data is an important and lucrative aspect of a technology business. Decisions about the type of data to collect (and how much to collect in the first place) have far-reaching consequences for your product or service. Algorithmic bias & transparency One of the inherent problems with technology is the manifestation of bias in algorithms, both within the selections of datasets to consider and the way decision-making processes are programmed. UI/UX design Features such as buttons, icons, colour schemes and imagery will affect how users engage with your product. Tech founders need to make sure these design choices are made with the best interests of their customers. Privacy concerns As a lot of the data that is collected digitally includes personal information – and in some cases highly sensitive and intimate material – protecting people’s personal data and information is crucial to run a responsible startup. What are examples of biased technology design? We introduced four businesses whose technology design included inherent flaws in our article on Good Technology Gone Bad, but there are countless other examples. Here’s a short excerpt: Face-recognition software of webcams not being able to track dark-skinned faces Chatbots created to emulate human conversation adopting and perpetuating racist and anti-feminist rhetoric“Beautifying” social media filters mimicking caucasian, western beauty standards and automatically making users’ skin colour a few shades lighterSpeech recognition software making twice as many errors when transcribing the voices of BIPOC than white Americans Really, we could go on and on. How can I make sure I’m making the best decisions for my startup? 1. Become aware of your own personal biases The very first step towards change is knowledge. Reflecting on your own background, privilege and bias is crucial to prevent them from leaking into your technology design. Taking the Responsible Technology Assessment is an excellent way to start. 2. Know your customers and stakeholders The first rule of technology design fight club is to know your stakeholders inside and out. For more detailed information on how socio-cultural understanding can help your startup grow, have a look at our article on representation and diversity. 3. Consider your sphere of operation Base your technology design decisions on information about the characteristics of your ecosystem instead of your own intuitions or assumptions. If we look at our previous example of the racist chatbot, its developers would have had to take a look and assess the data they were providing it in the first place. 4. Create diverse teams One reason for biases in technology design is the missing diversity within a team. Check your recruiting processes and make diversity in your company a priority. It will not only have advantages for your algorithms but will also improve your overall work culture. 5. Evaluate the outcome of your product or service After you design your product or service don’t rest on your laurels – make sure to test your output and outcome to ensure both are as unbiased as possible. Integrate continuous reviews to spot any potential accidental adverse effects as soon as possible.

Digital technology has transformed the workings of democracy in profound ways and plays a central role in how people engage politically. It affects the power balance between individual citizens and the main socio-political institutions, political parties in particular. For our second last #ResponsibleTechInsights we had a chat with Sophie Spiegelberger, the Chair of Democrats Abroad Austria’s Communications Committee. We spoke about the challenges digitalisation has brought to political organisations and discussed the opportunities and risks of technological platforms across the political spectrum. You’re leading the Communications Committee at Democrats Abroad, can you tell us more about what that means? Democrats Abroad is the official arm of the Democratic Party representing Americans who live outside the US. Our mission is to provide American citizens living in Austria a voice in the U.S. government and to elect Democrats by mobilizing the overseas vote. As an organisation, our one and only goal is to encourage people to vote. The Communications Committee is a centerpiece of Democrats Abroad Austria’s internal mechanics. We liaise with different members and representatives to create campaigns, assist in marketing and contribute to membership growth. And in what areas are your main activities happening? Our job revolves around two pillars: press & media relations, and social media. When it comes to the press, organisations such as Democrats Abroad are called upon by local media to represent the Democratic Party in various debates, panels and interviews, especially during an election year. The challenge lies in walking the line of explaining often complex domestic U.S. policy issues to a foreign audience while also staying on message. Social media on the other hand, and I can’t stress this enough, is the flagship of every organisation in 2020. Your standing is often judged by your social media presence – the quality of your content and the tone you strike. Fast forward to 2020, where politicians are their own one-man media outlet. How has political communication changed throughout modern technology? It would be an understatement to say that politics have transformed in the past two decades. The 2008 election cycle was the first in which the internet began to muscle its way into the electoral process and I don’t have to tell you that it doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere anytime soon. Social media has become increasingly important. It was first hailed as a novel opportunity for candidates to connect and communicate with supporters directly, without the “hassle” of having to go through traditional media channels. Now fast forward to 2020, where politicians are their own one-man media outlet. Donald Trump has 88,7 million followers on Twitter while The New York Times has about half of that. Bypassing and discrediting journalists has become the name of the game, punching below the belt has become standard. Digital communication has become a battle post for political organisations. You deal with disinformation and internet trolls while you’re also trying to create content that goes viral. All of this is doing nothing to nurture a healthier democracy. Well, that definitely sounds like a lot. Any opportunities you see in using technology then? Statistics show that if only people under 35 voted, merely 35% would have cast their ballot for Trump. This means the direction is shifting towards a more progressive agenda. And there is incredible potential for technology to engage the younger generation a lot more. The Democratic National Committee for example has built a polished online and social media presence. They transitioned well into digital grassroots organising, utilising platforms like Slack to create online volunteer communities. The digitalisation of fundraising has also proven to be an immensely powerful tool, especially during the pandemic-stricken 2020 election. In my opinion, the most valuable tech solutions for campaigns aren’t social media platforms, but rather project management and fundraising software that make campaigning more efficient and accessible to a new set of people. As a smaller organisation, how do you approach the current digital landscape? Globally, Democrats Abroad has almost 200.000 members, our branch in Austria has only a fraction of that. With a small budget, using both organic and paid social media activities to spread the word is a must. Extremely targeted placements on social media for example are a good way to go. Of course this advantage for us can also be a disadvantage as a whole as it increases polarisation. On that note, I have a strict content policy at Democrats Abroad in place to avoid polarisation as best as we can. We pursue a strict no-Trump content strategy. I want our content to be constructive rather than in opposition to the incumbent, which is why we avoid references to his antics. The efforts that these companies made so far to combat this are not enough, they’ve gotten off scot-free. And what are the threats technology products and services pose? Bots, fake news and polarisation. Misinformation campaigns are intentionally designed to influence people’s views and beliefs in ways that benefit only one side, not the democratic process. There were first signs of social media platforms being misused in this sense in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But the efforts that these companies made so far to combat this are not enough, they’ve gotten off scot-free. Labelling Trump’s tweets with cautionary messages that indicate they contain, to put it mildly, questionable claims are largely symbolic. They haven’t proven to stop the virality of his tweets. When people’s opinions are influenced and inevitably distorted by information that is incorrect, inaccurate and not trustworthy, their political decisions and actions are effectively harmful to themselves. Fake News is the buzzword of 2016, 2020 and beyond; what’s your stance on this? Social media often gets blamed for the explosion of fake news. Few talk about traditional media’s role in polarising the electorate. Driven by a ratings-craze, America’s TV networks, on both sides, have shifted further and further apart. MSNBC is as much to blame as FOX News and many liberals don’t want to acknowledge that. Filter bubbles a product of network TV too. So as long as we demonise social media for creating alternate versions of reality, we are addressing only half of the problem. There’s a need for publicly-funded media that doesn’t rely on advertising in the U.S.. Especially local journalism has been experiencing a painful death. Until money and media are detached from one another I don’t see how we will be able to tackle this deep polarisation. This isn’t journalism, this is his personal opinion. Then how are you dealing with the spread of misinformation? The key to combating misinformation is not framing your content in opposition to something else. What I mean by that is the following: present the facts without referring to the fake news you are trying to debunk. Trump uses fake news very deftly. He tweets whatever’s on his mind, whether it’s true or not. These posts will be seen, liked and shared by millions of people. This isn’t journalism, this is his personal opinion. What’s interesting, however, is that his claims then get picked up and validated by traditional news networks that should (at least in theory) have some sort of journalistic integrity. Which is exactly what happened when Trump refused to concede despite no evidence of voter fraud in this year’s election. Exactly. This was to be expected though. He announced that he might not accept the results if he lost four years ago too. In 2020 his message remained surprisingly consistent. Perhaps this was a good thing. Democrats were absolutely prepared for the possibility of him contesting the results and refusing to cooperate. This means that the Biden campaign was able to meticulously plan out their post-election messaging and lawyer up to fight him in court. This is probably the first time I’m saying this but #ThanksTrump. Do you have any closing thoughts you would like to share with our readers? All in all I’m very optimistic when it comes to democracy and technology. We’re far from using all of the digital opportunities that are out there. Humans are infinitely innovative and I can’t wait to see what developments are just around the corner.

Not quite. Wietse Van Ransbeeck is the Co-Founder and CEO of CitizenLab, a digital platform for cities and governments that brings citizen participation into the 21st century. Whether it’s on mobility, environment or infrastructure, CitizenLab gives citizens a well-deserved seat at the decision making table. What is CitizenLab? CitizenLab offers a digital democracy platform to local governments. We give citizens a voice on the topics and policies they care about in their neighbourhoods and cities. It initially started out as a university project by me and my co-founder Aline Muylaert four years ago. We looked at established ways to participate in the decision making process and came to the realisation that there was no easy and practical way for citizens to provide input. We wanted to explore how we could make our voices heard, as we really wanted to contribute ideas on how to improve things in our city. How did your first project look like? When we started four years ago, participatory democracy was still very new. Some cities might have experimented with it but it was definitely not the standard. If you take a look at the situation today, participatory democracy has become complimentary to representative democracy. This is obviously good news for us. Our very first project was in April 2016 in Hasselt, Belgium. It was launched when the city was planning to set up a new park. Typically only 20-30 people showed up to their town hall meetings. We ended up getting over 600 people involved, so I’d definitely say it was quite a success. Back then we were using a prototype with more basic functions. But as we expanded our team and our co-founder and CTO Koen Gremmelprez joined, we scaled up the technology to a degree where over 150 cities from many different countries are using our platform today to keep their citizens engaged. How does it work exactly? As citizens, there are two ways to participate. The most common way is through the projects a city proposes. Within these projects we provide governments with a toolbox that includes a variety of methods they can use according to their needs. There are different ways to include citizens – think participatory budgeting, idea collection or surveys. But citizens can also make their voice heard through an important instrument that we call “citizen proposals”. They can launch their own proposal and once it gets the required amount of support from other verified citizens it gets passed on to the city council for consideration. This is a way to have a very direct impact and determine the political agenda from the bottom-up. When it comes to governments, we provide them with a back office where they can design their individual participatory process, explore the data to get detailed insights and gain a better understanding of their citizens’ needs. Our customers are mostly local governments. They buy an annual subscription for our platform and the software. But CitizenLab is obviously not only a tool or a technological platform, we also offer consulting services to help governments get the most out of it. A tool in itself is just a tool but it’s also crucial to know how to utilise it correctly. What was your biggest challenge at CitizenLab so far? It’s a challenge to really create change and institutionalise citizen participation. It’s easy to convince governments to do a project to engage their citizens but a paradigm shift towards opening up dialogue is harder. There needs to be a cultural change in the way administrations work, as citizens are asking for more transparency, more responsiveness from policy makers and more means to participate. Initially we thought that we just needed to provide a platform but we now understand that we need to look at it more holistically. Cities need guidance on how to actually get the most out of the platform and help to adopt and adapt to these new processes. Do you have any kind of criteria for cities that want to use your platform? We work with cities of all sizes. Generally we’d say cities should have at least 10,000 inhabitants in order to get a lot of value from the platform. If your smaller community is spread out it could definitely still be useful. However we realised that with large cities it’s easier to achieve change and see a high adoption of the platform. As of now we’re focusing on local governments but we are looking to work with regional and national governments too in the near future. Of course this will be a very different dynamic. Local governments are very action focused while it’s more about bigger policies and citizen dialogue on a regional or national level. We actually developed something that could be very useful for higher level governments as a response to the pandemic. A new online workshop-module for our toolbox enables online public meetings, with moderators asking questions, citizens giving their input and collaborating together in breakout groups. What was your best moment as a founder so far? First I would say that getting people on board that are truly motivated by the purpose of your company is just fantastic. When people believe in your mission it enables you to build a culture where your employees have more responsibility and autonomy because they are very self-driven. Our people believe that the work they do is important and recognise the contribution they make to society. This is by far what gives me the most energy and satisfaction on a daily basis. Second, I would say enabling governments to give people a say gives me a lot of gratification. Every single project on the platform is a meaningful opportunity for citizens to engage. I think there are a lot of stereotypes about the public sector. Five years ago this was something investors wouldn’t even look at. But today we are in a totally different era and people understand that policies that affect thousands of people are a great way to create impact and actually improve quality of life for so many. It’s remarkable to see how much more interest there is these days for government technology. Where do you see CitizenLab five years from now? I see us as a global company. We already worked with partners who have a local network and expertise in different countries in order to enter into new markets, so expanding globally with local experts is definitely a plan for the future. On the other hand we also want to make sure that we increase the uptake among citizens. We want to create lasting impact and enable citizens to meaningfully engage on the platform. We want to lower the barrier and get even more citizens to engage with their government. Do you have any advice for upcoming or already active impact tech founders? Yes, my advice is actually pretty straightforward. From day one, hire people who are devoted to your mission. Your mission is your biggest draw, it’s what sets social enterprises apart from other businesses when it comes to attracting talent. Be authentic about your vision and create a brand that is trustworthy. In the end, building a successful business is mainly about finding a very talented group of people who work towards the same goal. Managing to bring across your mission is the best way for social changemakers to really grow their impact in the long run. My second advice is that there is a great importance in sharing your expertise openly and collaboratively. For us this has been a focus from day one: sharing our knowledge, connecting with thought-leaders in our field and collectively shaping the future of digital democracy. Don’t be afraid and don’t keep your ideas to yourself – share what you know with others! It’s a really great way to build a reputation in your domain and create leverage.

There she had the task to create something, which would make life easier when we are going to Mars. She developed a device, which looks like a glove for the hands, to give astronauts resistance in everything they do. Moreover, it can give them artificial support when needed. This should prevent astronauts from losing muscle activity and fine motor skills during their time in space. After finishing it, she had the idea to use it also for people on earth. Getting to know diverse insights from patient organizations and people with disabilities she brought the technology together and started Tendo. What is Tendo all about? At Tendo, we’re developing robotic assistive devices for people who are disabled or have limited abilities. We developed a robotic glove that assists people who don’t have hand function. It’s a so-called exoskeleton, which you wear almost like a glove. It has a control unit that’s placed on the arm and it helps you to move your fingers and to get the strength you need. It has a biometric sensor that can detect what you want to do. So, when the sensor detects that you’re trying to grip and your hand doesn’t respond to it itself, it picks up the signals and sends the signal to the control unit. And from the control unit on the arm, we have wires that go to the glove. There are wires on the inside and outside of the glove and if you pull them the hand opens or closes. You can imagine it like a puppeteer, pulling strings, making your fingers move. For whom are you developing the product? In the first part of the company journey, we focused on people with rheumatic diseases and strokes. But then we actually met a man who is paralyzed. He tried the product and within 10 seconds, he could eat and drink by himself. We realized that it was such a big difference for him to be able to do these kinds of activities by himself. It was a clearer problem and value compared to other target groups. Therefore we decided to start there and flipped the target group. Now we are mainly addressing people who are paralyzed due to a high spinal cord injury. Those people are paralyzed in most parts of their bodies, except for that one or two arms, but without hand function. Nevertheless, our long-term goal is to include more target groups. Our product has also big potential for people who suffered a stroke. It’s a big target group and there is a huge need as well. If you had a stroke, you can have just as many problems opening the hand as you have to close it. That’s a big benefit with our technology compared to many others on the market, as it both opens and closes the hand. Where do you see Tendo in five years? In five years, we definitely would like to have grown as a company, as a team, and in (market) size. Our plan is to keep the Scandinavian market to ourselves but to license the technology globally. Within five years, we want to have licensees at least in the US. Moreover, we already received interest from users, clinics, and potential partners from all over the world. The product should start getting out there. Besides that, I definitely see us broadening our product portfolio and launching new products. Until now, what was your best moment as a founder? I think the best moment was the first user workshop, where we had this user who was able to drink and eat for the first time in 20 years. He was the first user we properly introduced the technology to and he was so happy. He lifted up his glass, proudly, to cheer with us many times! This was such a great day. We got proof that all the hard work was worth it and we can make a difference. That was 1.5 years ago and I still smile when I think about it. What would you say was your biggest challenge? I think everything has been quite challenging in a way. In the beginning, the most difficult thing was to figure out what it means to be an entrepreneur. I think the biggest challenge throughout time has been that medical devices bring a lot of rules and regulations. That’s of course there for a reason, but sometimes as a startup, you get a bit frustrated. So, developing a medical device is extremely expensive and time-consuming due to all the regulations that exist. Do you think that people look at you differently because you’re a female founder? It’s a difficult question, as I only know my perspective. I think it’s sometimes good, sometimes bad to be a female founder. Statistically, I have a disadvantage of finding investments and people believing that I can do it. On the other hand, the benefit is that people recognize or remember the company more easily because I’m basically always the only woman in the room. I think as a female CEO, I still stand out and that can also be beneficial. But there have been inappropriate situations too. There were investors that say that they have fewer beliefs in female founders and I should never go to a meeting without a man because alone, as a woman, I am less credible. I have no idea if that’s true though. It’s definitely a difficult question to answer. Do you have any advice for other (impact tech) founders? Be out there and talk about it as much as you possibly can. I think many people aren’t talking (enough) about their idea, as they’re scared that people will steal it. But you don’t need to be afraid of that because you just say what you’re doing not how you’re doing it. Honestly, a big part of us being quite successful in the beginning was because we were always out there talking about it. I even called up newspapers saying “I have a super cool story you want to write about it?” instead of waiting for them to contact me. And they did, we got a good attraction and then more things followed. Get different perspectives and always aim for easy-understandable storytelling. If you love your technology/work, it’s easy to get stuck on it. So you need to start looking at it from all the perspectives that are out there – from an investor, your customers, etc. Put yourself in their shoes, because if you can’t tell the story in a way that they like it, it’s not going to be successful. Then go out and talk to them and if you don’t get a positive response, ask yourself why. Do you tell the story in a wrong way or did you just meet the wrong people? Generally, I think it’s common that people try to impress by saying difficult words, but you don’t impress anyone, you just exclude them from the conversation. Build a strong team. I’m always the person outside talking, but I have a super-strong team behind me that works really hard to get the technology in place, and it would not be possible to do it without them. We’ve been really lucky to have great people from the beginning with diverse perspectives and backgrounds. It can be very challenging as well, as it can take a bit of time for us to agree on something but when we do it’s a great outcome.

An SDG 5 progress analysis"," Using tech to challenge gender inequality? An SDG 5 progress analysis Sarah Klimt tech2impact The 8th of March represents International Women’s Day – a global day to celebrate women’s achievements and raise awareness of women’s equality and gender parity as exemplified by this year’s #ChooseToChallenge theme. In this sense, we want to take a closer look at Sustainable Development Goal number 5 (SDG 5), namely gender equality and women and girls’ empowerment and have a look at the current status quo in our society. The basics The United Nations has defined gender equality by stating women and men possess equal rights, equal access to any opportunities, and the right to assume any responsibilities irrespective of whether they are born female or male. SDG 5 covers a diverse range of targets that aim to eliminate the following gender inequalities: Discrimination, violence, and exploitation against all women and girls everywhereHarmful practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage… and drives constructive work across the following areas: Acknowledge and value unpaid care and domestic work Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rightReforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, including access to ownership, inheritance, financial services, and natural resourcesPromote the use of technology, especially information and communications technology to empower womenReinforce policies and legislation for the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levelsThe scope of SDG 5 is rightly large and ambitious, which makes us wonder about the current state of gender equality today. So, let us take a look at some of the stats from the previous years. The details Progress continues to lag due to existing economic and social barriers for women and girls. Although there are improvements in problematic areas such as child marriage, female genital mutilation, and the underrepresentation of women in the political realm, gender inequalities continue to persist. Impact of COVID 19 With the Covid-19 pandemic, the consensus is that gender inequalities are bound to amplify, and areas showing improvements so far are likely to regress. Considering that before the pandemic, women were already carrying the main burden of unpaid work than men, this tendency is set to grow even more now. For instance, a poll covering 17 countries on unpaid work reveals that women and girls have taken over a large share of responsibility regarding childcare, family, and household duties due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The strong emphasis on unpaid work has implications on a woman’s access to time, income, career opportunities, and their mental well-being. Figure 1: Statistics on child marriage and unpaid work prior to the pandemic. (Source: The Sustainable Development Goals 2020 Report)The pandemic could hamper the efforts that already went into addressing child marriage and female genital mutilation. Simultaneously, the lockdowns have subjugated increased violence on women, with data showing an increase in domestic violence reporting calls. Employment equality Regarding employment, in both emerging and mature economies, the pattern of work is gender-specific (Figure 2). Female workers are 19 percent more likely to be at risk than male workers. A well-known fact by now is that women, in general, are disproportionately represented in sectors adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2: Examples of female and male work clusters, showing that employment is gender-specific. (Source: McKinsey)The gender pay gap is currently at 23 percent globally, and without any targeted action, it will take 68 years to achieve equal pay. The World Economic Forum believes that it will take 217 years to reach gender parity if gender inequality continues the way it is currently seen in the workforce and politics. Urgent action is needed to drive gender equality, knowing that $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 by promoting women’s equality. It is very accurate to highlight this statement on gender inequality that it is not just a “moral and social issue but also a critical economic challenge”. The future is in responsible tech One of the many goals of gender equality lies in using technology to empower women. It could either be by encouraging women to choose STEM subjects and improve their representation in this sector or use tech solutions to solve wicked problems. A more diverse team is most likely to be more creative, innovative and deliver higher profitable outcomes. Representation of women and girls in leadership positions is one way of addressing prevailing gender inequalities, considering that such roles are underrepresented by women – “for every 100 men in leadership positions, there are just 37 women”. You may ask yourself why is this important? The term gender equality acknowledges that the “needs, interests, roles and experiences of women and men” vary and require further understanding to address gender inequality at its core. A strategy used to analyse such differences is known as gender mainstreaming, which aims to integrate both women’s and men’s perspectives regarding decision-making and planning of any project or policy implementation. The way forward Inherently, such a process challenges prevailing societal structures by recognising that both women’s and men’s realities are different, which in turn helps to tackle gender inequalities over a long-term basis. In this regard, gender mainstreaming is not about achieving gender balance but by analysing the context of both sexes via a gender analysis, ensuring that their voices are heard, and creating an equal playing field. Figure 3: A framework for gender mainstreaming (Source: European Institute for Gender Equality)Now, if women are underrepresented in sectors such as tech, then it is highly likely that not enough thought will be given towards gendered considerations. For example, artificial intelligence requires data, which contains bias as the data that is inputted in the first place is not neutral but influenced by the person inputting the data and this is not free from gender, race, and culture biases. Considering that the majority of the population working in tech are male, will most likely have implications on gender equality. The tech2impact members that #ChooseToChallenge Amongst tech2impact’s ecosystem, we have startups that address the SDG goal of gender equality, and who have chosen to challenge issues related to gender bias and gender inequalities. ETIQ AI ETIQ AI for example has an intentional approach to artificial intelligence by creating software that determines algorithmic biases. This, in turn, is likely to prevent wrongful gender stereotypes and break barriers for women when it comes to hiring decisions, loan approvals, medical diagnosis, etc. Develop Diverse Similarly, the startup Develop Diverse offers a software solution that addresses stereotypical content for gender, age, ethnicity, and helps provide non-stereotypical alternatives. And in turn, HR and communication managers make recruitment processes more inclusive, encouraging a diverse set of applicants to apply. It does show that language can convey stereotypes and discourage around 50 percent of prospective applicants from entering the talent pool when not communicated appropriately. Metta Space When it comes to sexual harassment Metta Space’s offers a B2B integrated platform, a first of its kind to help companies put an end to sexual harassment and allow them to deal with such cases effectively. Also, their reporting app for employees is set to release very soon too! Salvatio Push A further example of tech enabling women’s protection is Salvatio Push, a wearable gadget used to prevent violence against women. The device comes with a push-button, which allows the user to reveal their location to their community whilst facing a dangerous situation. Respondents who are part of the community can notify the authorities in a timely manner to take rapid action. Essentially, it is a prime example of using technology to make spaces more inclusive and safe for women. Bridge Gap Renewables Inc. Last but definitely not least is the startup Bridge Gap Renewables Inc. They aim to enable electrification for rural communities and provide an alternative to diesel generators. The digital gap between rural and urban areas is significant and problematic. What urban communities might take for granted such as quick internet and reliable power is not a reality for rural areas. The latter are more likely to miss out on education and business related opportunities. Both are vital factors to emancipate women and girls, which Bridge Gap Renewables contributes to achieving. Concluding remarks Of course, tech alone cannot solely fix gender problems without thoughtful considerations given to different gendered contexts. It is not surprising that the Good Tech Lab warns us that technological solutions should focus on understanding systems and data. The authors advocate for systems thinking – understanding the context of problems and their interrelationships as illustrated in the following quote: “Think in systems—and data. Wicked problems resist any reductionist solution. Addressing them requires to understand system dependencies, differentiate effects from root causes, prioritize the best leverage points on which to intervene, and anticipate unintended consequences.” Good Tech Lab To explore more engaging examples of tech ventures that enable the Sustainable Development Goals, be sure to use tech2impact’s Impact Tech Radar.
