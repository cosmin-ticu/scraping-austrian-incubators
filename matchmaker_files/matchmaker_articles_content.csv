Letter from CEO Nicolai Schaettgen","2018 is gone – what to expect for 2019? We are in our 4th year, are present in >20 countries and achieved what most initially called “stupid”: to live off our business model. We are proud and thus allow ourselves to join in the sheer unlimited number of outlooks 2019. Here comes our very personal one. 2019 is dedicated to “Less is more” – Why that? We are doing too much… Opportunities are turning up and each one is eating up a few of our resources leading to a mismatch between needed and actual attention. Thereby our vision is simple: “Make startup-corporate collaboration simple and successful” – as such, we will much more diligently focus on activities leading us to that vision and – more importantly – stop activities (very painful…). Where will our bets be placed? 1. Make our existing core more efficient In 2018 we managed to significantly strengthen our team and welcome many senior resources (Attila Keszeg, Amine Tazi, Allison Amber, Daniel Heller, Alireza Abdolali, Arkadiusz Andrzejewski, Chris Morgan, Claudio Staub, Karl Rothleitner, Karl Peter Nöstler, Niko Schweitzer, Pascal Hohman, Stefanos Anastasiou, Liza Semenova, Anastasia Rastorgina, Munaa AlTamini, Francesca Montanar, Björn Schättgen). In 2019 we will focus on bringing this potential to the market: we know what needs to be done, now we need to get better at it. 2. Be more creative in the collaboration models with our startup partners All our startup partners (currently we are working with nine portfolio companies) are confirming the value which we are creating directly and indirectly. Still, we feel we can do more and bring more value to the startup world to help to navigate through the corporate jungle. We are already working on new engagement models to enable the impact of our work to spread. 3. Strengthen and reinvent the way we work with our corporate partners We have had interactions with >300 corporations in 2018 (!!!) – in reality we have done business with only a fraction of those, which means that we need to qualify better the business potential. Given where we are and where we are heading, we are looking positively into 2019. Thank you all for joining us. Sincerely grateful, Nicolai Schaettgen","1.

"2","https://www.match-maker.ventures/834-2/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Edward Twiddy (Atom Bank)","Learnings from the global FinTech Innovator Edward Twiddy is one of the founders and Chief Innovation Officer of Atom Bank. Atom Bank is the first UK bank built exclusively for mobile and it is ranked the sixth leading global FinTech innovator. When talking about Atom Bank, Edward brings the parallel to the James song from 90s: “We were born of frustration and we keep that frustration close to us, as it is the way to continue reshaping. We want to be the business that never stops surprising.” This relentless desire to innovate echoed through our entire interview. How do you explain Atom Bank to an eight-year-old in maximum three sentences? Atom Bank is a brand-new bank that allows you to use your face or voice to get into your money wherever you want or whenever you want to. What are 2-3 concerns about Atom Bank’s future that keep you up at night? My children keep me up at night ???? Regarding Atom Bank, it’s three Cs: customers (doing right by them at all times), cyber threats (it really is a war out there) and capital (the lifeblood of any start up). How have you convinced your teammates to do something they were not keen to do? At Atom Bank we haven’t had to face such a situation, as our people are willing to produce very complex math calculations at one moment and help to clean up the kitchen the next. We don’t allow peoples’ roles to be defined. The best way to explain it is to bring a parallel from football world. In Dutch team, every player plays equally in all different roles. They never won the world cup, but they have entertained a lot of people. Dutch play is much more enjoyable than that of other teams where roles are very clearly defined. Which functions/areas in financial industry will not likely be replaced by FinTechs, simply due to the basic human nature and human needs? Financial sector has been through many revolutions and technology has been applied there for decades. Sector is currently attacked throughout the value chain. I believe that humans are by nature interested in innovation and that’s what leads us to progress. As such, I struggle to find any areas that shall not be transformed by FinTechs. You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What will you do with the elephant? Will grow better roses ???? What is the misconception people have about you? They might think that I’m a banker, but I’m not. I work in the bank, but am not a banker and am rightly kept away from the real process of banking. In truth I am actually a bit of a dilettante and mostly I think about what’s coming next. If you could only choose one song to be played every time you enter a room for the rest of your life. Which song would it be? Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFo8-JqzSCM) – the greatest rock and roll track ever.","14.

And because of the range of use cases 5G can support for numerous industries, it has the potential to be a societal game changer – and an integral part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. This isn’t hype, but the realization of a technology that has the potential to support a completely connected world. The requirements for 5G technology are laid out: 5G is estimated to potentially facilitate up to one million devices per square kilometer It should have 10,000 times greater capacity than the cellular networks of 2010 Peak 5G speeds will be available from 20Gbps (with speeds everywhere of 100Mbps in the downlink and 50Mbps in the uplink) It will support everything from 0km/h all the way up to 500km/h high speed vehicular access (i.e. in the case of trains) 5G’s one-millisecond latency and ‘five nines’ (99.999%) reliability means that critical systems will be available for autonomous driving for mass transit, connected healthcare for developed and emerging markets, and will bring unique immersive experiences never before thought possible Leading telecom vendors (like Nokia) as well as various standardization bodies, research institutes, network operators have been working together very hard to be able to introduce the next step of the evolution in that domain. 5G is going to be one of the main building blocks for 4th Industrial Revolution and dense digitalization of society. At the end of the day, it will be beneficial for everyone. What will I be able to do with 5G what I can’t do today? As a consumer, you`ll be able to download very large chunks of content (like ultra-HD 360-degree videos) in a matter of minutes regardless of the device being used and where you are. Then, you`ll be able to enjoy real-time gaming on your mobile device with a significantly better experience than today, due to the vastly improved latency (up to 1ms) compared over what is now delivered by 4G networks. 5G will play an important role in connected/autonomous driving, again due to unique low latency capabilities – Nokia is currently testing a number of applications of this with partners. 5G enables the seamless interaction between robots and humans which is – again – highly sensitive to latency. Last, but not least, it will enable so-called ‘network slicing’, which means that a number of different applications with completely different requirements can run on the same physical network infrastructure at the same time. This will allow network operators to distribute ‘slices’ of their network, each one tailored to the unique needs of their customers, for example a slice with extremely low latency for hospital and medical type of applications, a slice with high security parameters for banking, a slice with ultra-high capacity for a stadium during popular concert or football game and so on. This will allow many different use cases and business models and improve end user experience. What are the specific challenges attached to 5G? The technology is still under standardization, but this will be resolved in nearest future. Now, we need to work on the use cases for various industry segments. We must think beyond traditional silos and take an ecosystem approach. This is key for later adoption and we have a lot of trials and other activities going on with companies across sectors. But to ensure timely deployments of 5G infrastructures and services, policy frameworks must be adapted and be ‘5G ready’. In this context, there are three priorities for policy makers: Making more spectrum available: accelerating spectrum identification and allocation to mobile broadband is critical, as well as ensuring the appropriate rulings in those spectrum bands. Modernizing rules to incentivize and facilitate the deployment of telecom infrastructure: in this context, replicability of processes and simplification of installation regimes for small cells can help dramatically decrease deployment timelines and costs. Ensuring new business models and services can flourish: here’s where balanced net neutrality rules are critical, allowing ‘quality of service’ differentiation. While preserving the principles of the open internet, differentiating network traffic is important as users require higher speeds and lower latency connectivity for specific usages (network slices). In addition, cross border free flow of data is essential to incentivize and scale cloud based services. Regarding data-protection and security, a delicate balance must be found to effectively protect end-users while enabling new digital services. Globally, who is leading and where does Europe stand in 5G? At a global level, Nokia sees China, the United States, South Korea and Japan as taking a strong lead in making 5G happen. For example, 5G technology was trialled during the recent winter sports event in South Korea. In general, Nokia sees the first commercial 5G network launches starting in 2019 – a year earlier than previously suggested, and it’s possible that there may even be first 5G services starting in 2018, especially amongst US operators. These are not expected to be full, nationwide launches, but selective evolutions of networks with 5G air links. Europe is a somewhat different place, where technology launches requiring regulatory alignment can happen at a different speed to other regions. However, it is recognized at EU level that 5G technology is an opportunity for Europe to regain technological leadership and increase competition, with all market players – operators, regulators, vendors and customers working together very closely, not an easy task in such a fragmented market. When will 5G be commercially relevant? We see large-scale commercial rollouts of 5G services by 2020, with standardization in place, and chipset and device manufacturers producing a variety of 5G-capable devices in volume. What do you recommend any MNO today? The pace of 5G development is running very fast. All operators are forming their 5G plans and implementation strategies, looking at their respective markets and what their competitors may do. Being a pioneer in new technologies and services has its challenges, bringing 5G to market will have financial and operational challenges for service providers. But fortune favors the brave and with 5G, MNOs will have a unique opportunity to change their market position, as was done in the past with 4G. To sum up, I would recommend having very concrete plans for when and how, as an MNO, you would like to implement 5G technology. And, of course Nokia, is happy to help and advise, because we are working with the biggest and most advanced CSPs across the globe and are happy to share our experience.","27.

Now with over 1,500 employees, the San Francisco-based company has branched out into mortgages, personal loans, investing and banking—all with a digital-first approach. The Challenge SoFi was not aware of a technical issue on their website causing an increase in incomplete loan applications and was blind to the magnitude of the phenomenon. In fact, the issue went completely under their radar until Glassbox started to capture and visualize all of their user sessions. The Solution With Glassbox’s tag-less deployment, SoFi was capturing 100% of sessions and all events and elements, including user activity and technical elements occurring behind the scenes. Root-casue analysis sped by real-time anomaly detection and alerts Glassbox’s anomaly detection engine, based on machine learning, alerted the SoFi team to 546 sessions in a one-week period in which users received an error message and never completed their loan application. Measuring the revenue impact with Cashbox SoFi leveraged the Cashbox dashboard in Glassbox to capture the value of the user input in the loan application form. The team was able to aggregate all loan applications and track the following insights: Average loan value Monthly loan value Average monthly loan value Geolocation OS/Browser/ISP By recognizing and understanding the full scope of the problem and true monetary impact of this technical error, the business team and the IT team flagged this issue as a top priority. By sharing session replays of the affected sessions with the production support team, the root cause of error was identified and fixed within the same day. The Main Results If the glitch had continued to go unnoticed, the failed sessions would add up to over 28,000 abandoned applications annually. With an average success rate of 38.2%, it was estimated this error could have caused a loss of 10,845 loan deals. Based on a hypothetical monthly loan value of $900 per loan (the actual loan value has been changed for demonstration purposes), SoFi prevented a potential annual loss of over $9 million by fixing this error. ""Glassbox gives us the most accurate view of how our members experience our app and saves us countless time on squashing bugs, finding friction, and gives us confidence in how we plan our UX roadmap."" Software Development Lead at SoFi About Glassbox Glassbox is a customer experience solution that enables companies to better understand their customers’ demands and struggles across all digital platforms.

"22","https://www.match-maker.ventures/id-theft-insights-from-industry-expert-daniel-soederberg/","MatchMakerVentures","Identity theft: Insights from industry expert Daniel Söderberg","One can practically steal your life. The ever-rising threat of identity theft is tough reality. ID theft happened once every 2 seconds in 2017. You are more likely to have your identity stolen than your car taken or home burglarized. We got together with Daniel Soederberg, CEO of EyeOnID, a company that provides an out-of-box solution for proactive identity theft protection, to understand the truths behind identity theft and get first-hand professional advice on how to protect ourselves from the bad actors. What is ID theft? ID theft (to make it simple) is when someone else is using your identity to do something. It could be malicious (=bad) or not that harmful (someone writing a post on your Facebook account when you forgot to logout on a public computer). In other words, identity theft is when someone else is acting under your identity, doesn’t matter if it’s harmful or not. Why can it be so threatful? Because you can do so much with it. Someone can go out there and act totally as if they are you: they can create a fake passport, take loans in your name, open up bank accounts in your name, create digital accounts on various sites and services, they can use your information go to the hospital (especially in the US) and get the medical bills sent to you, or even create a criminal record on you. In the worst-case scenario one can practically steal your whole life. Who are the primary targets of ID theft? Historically the threat actors in many cases acted on men in the age group of 25-55 as it was easier to get their information and they usually had most money. That has changed. Nowadays everyone is a potential victim: men, women, older, younger. The threat actors have found other ways of how they can profit from stolen identities. Younger generations are a perfect target for digital services accounts (e.g. Netflix, Steam, Spotify) and taking loans. Older generations tend to not actively monitor their bank account activity. They also tend to have a higher trust for people, for example if someone says that they are calling from the bank with malicious intention and are less suspicious. Meanwhile, children are the most unprotected generation as the industry is not there yet to ensure preventive measures. What implications does it have? Depends on the damage. If someone took over a teenager’s Facebook account – it happens. If in addition nude pictures of that person were posted and the whole school saw them – the psychological damage is unavoidable. For older generations, if a credit card gets stolen, the bank issues a new card and, in most cases, gives back the money. The trend we are starting to see though, is that banks have started to question customer fraud claims and, in some cases, refused to cover for lost money. How do the bad actors choose their targets? There are two sides of the coin: malicious actors targeting specific individuals or target groups and those that go wide. For this example, let’s say that Facebook has been attacked and the hackers got a hold of 50 million users sensitive data. The malicious actors targeting specific groups have a wide range of ways to decide who and how they want to act. For instance, if the chat information was part of the leak they could easily filter out credit card information. They could also structure all the data in a database and use that to create specific target groups: Gender, Age group, Civil status, Country, Occupation, Interest, Joined groups, Mail address, Phone number, etc. From that information the malicious actor can create tailored phishing emails with the aim to get a hold of additional sensitive information or why not a ransomware. Malicious actors going for a wider alternative will most probably go for a Credential Stuffing Attack. The aim of the attack is to test the leaked credentials (username and password) from the breach against other websites and services in order to gain access to them. In this example the malicious actor will automatically test 50 million usernames and passwords against companies like Netflix, Uber, Spotify, Gmail, Steam but also smaller companies who do not have as high security standard. The sophisticated tools that today is being used in attacks like these can almost mimic a human behavior making it harder to detect. Whenever they get access to a new site they will store that information in order to either sell, share or use it for additional malicious actions. Due to the fact that users in 80% of the cases are reusing one or several passwords it is easy to understand this is a popular method among malicious actors. It is so popular that 43% of all login attempts are done by bots. On darknet you will find loads of sites selling various logins to sites like Netflix – you can buy a subscription for a lifetime, and whenever the current user account gets blocked, they will send you a new stolen one. How bad is it when your credit card gets stolen? When your credit card is stolen, it is more like a bump on the road – a week or two until things are solved, you get a new card and money back from your bank. Your credit card is an arm length away from you. Your social security number (SSN), on the other hand, is like a ring around you, tied very close. So, it’s always worse when bad actors go for other parts of your identity. The effect of an identity breach is for life – you cannot change your personal ID in many countries. Identity theft can go on for years. In the majority of identity theft cases, a bad actor can exploit you for as long as they can make money off you. Once you block them with proactive services combined with reactive services, they will stop and move on to their next victim. There will be no reason for them to continue and the risks of getting caught will increase. What about when your email as a username together with a password has been part of a breach? This is the most common type of leaked information, we are talking about billions of credentials circulating. First of all when notified you’d need to change passwords on all the websites you registered with your email, and it’s a lot to remember. Rule of thumb, always remember the 5-10 accounts you have with the most sensitive information about you and start with them. Most people have 2 private emails: one they use for regular sites and one for ‘crappy’ sites. The problem though is that we are lazy and for that reason we reuse our passwords on all different usernames (emails) we have for various sites including our email for work. Finding out other emails connected to you as an individual is in many cases easy. With everything being connected to the internet, we are looking not just at identity theft, but privacy theft. The ring around you is getting bigger: your IP number will be more and more critical, tied to you via IoT devices: your refrigerator, TV or vacuum cleaner will have your private information. We are inclining towards using the term ‘privacy protection’ instead of ‘identity protection’ as the next step. What are the steps to take if you fall victim of ID theft? If you are a victim, using ID monitoring will give you an idea of where your information have and is going. If you don’t have an assistant service, you need to be proactive yourself. Inform the police, notify banks and credit bureaus Start with a police report as it is needed for insurance claims. Step two is calling the credit bureaus – put a block on your name if possible (various from country to country), preventing bad actors from taking loans and affecting your credit score. Talk to the bank directly to have this information in the log book and check your account status for any suspicious transactions. If you have an ID-Theft insurance, you should naturally call them first for guidance. Advice: keep big sums on your savings account, minimize your amounts on the transactional account to minimize damage. Block your credit card if you see any fraudulent transactions. Check your mailbox The loan papers are often sent to your mailbox at home, so make sure you have a lock on it. Sometimes the bad actor can wait for the mailman, take your post and sign for it in your name. Keep track of all the post that is coming: act immediately upon receiving any confirmation for activities you did not do. Protect your email account Change your logins for mail accounts – it’s extremely important. Bad actors will download everything off your email box and work through it to find sensitive data: anything from a photo of your credit card to private information from family members. Remember: do not reuse your password, do not give out more information than is needed, do not be so trustworthy with information! Think of it like this: businesses want to collect as much information about you as they can, in order to make money. You may not give it out knowingly, yet you have agreed to all their terms and conditions. GDPR states: service providers shouldn’t take more information than is necessary to provide a service. However, it is not always being followed. The internet is the worst place – just by accessing a site you give out your information, such as your IP number. We are foreseeing a big shift: your IP number/numbers will have a higher value than your Social Security Number (SSN) as it will be tied up to more places. Think of the internet the way you act in your normal life: you wouldn’t give out all information about yourself when going grocery shopping. If you intend to be anonymous, you can pay cash. When you buy food online, you give out your name, phone number, address, password, email etc. Understand that the online store will track everything you do on their site and enrich your data with the analytic result (buying behavior, when you buy, what you eat, for how many people, trending brands etc etc) – in many cases sensitive information about you that attackers can use. Ask yourself: what would I have done in the analogue world? How can EyeOnID help? EyeOnID have created what we call EyeOnID 360° Modules. These modules are created for creating a 360° protection around our Identity/Privacy. Monitoring ID-Monitoring is one part. We cover the digital part by creating proactive 360° Modules/services. As an example, the ID-Monitoring Module is like a filter that warns you when your information has been part of a leak that is being spread on the Internet or Darknet. We create higher awareness of users by doing risk scoring and by the Module password check we make sure users are not reusing the passwords that have been part of a previous breach. The higher the awareness, the less likely a user will become a victim. Support & Assistance Secondly, we provide Support and Assistant services that customers can always consult to prevent the attacks or ask for proactive advice after it happened. It is the support service they can always call if they are worried about something, get tips and advice on how to act or get explanations on warnings and notifications they have received from the proactive modules, like ID-Monitoring. If they would fall victim, the Assistance service is there to hold their hand, to lead them through various steps, block what happened and prevent more things from happening. Insurance Finally, we provide the insurance to cover the costs that might occur – anything from having to stay home from work, legal aid, court costs etc. The proactive digital 360° Modules are like a fishing net, we will catch a large number of fishes (threats) in the net but if a fish swings by, we will catch it at the assistance service. Otherwise, we pick it up at the insurance part. These are the three steps to help you as a consumer. To find out more about EyeOnID, contact us.","2.

They have been among the first to introduce corporate accelerators, launch corporate venture capital arms, and introduce a variety of corresponding managerial roles. However, realizing value from these innovation efforts have proved elusive. Today, professional investors shy away from start-ups whose business models build on telco collaboration, focusing instead on those disrupting the slow-moving giants. To gauge the state of affairs, Match-Maker Ventures, Arthur D. Little and the Telecom Council of Silicon Valley launched a truly global study including views from ecosystem influencers drawn from corporates, start-ups and investors, with telco industry respondents covering about 82% of global telecom revenues. The results expose the increasing divide across stakeholders: Telecom operators have furthered their open innovation efforts but face headwinds to achieve meaningful scale or realize value. On the other hand, start-ups and start-up-like entities continue to shun telecom operators as partners of choice. We trust this study will bring you up to speed on the innovation quest for telecom operators and spurs you to revisit current efforts within your organization.

"24","https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-alberto-onetti/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Alberto Onetti (Mind the Bridge and Startup Europe Partnership)","Learnings from Europe’s collaboration forerunner We had the pleasure to speak to Alberto Onetti about Silicon Valley, the European startup vision and the “elephants” we still need to move in Europe. Alberto is one of the key players of the European corporate-startup ecosystem as Chairman of Mind the Bridge and coordinator of the Startup Europe Partnership. Alberto supports the European way for startups, which is starting to produce results, but is still far from over: “We are only at the beginning!” Just as proud as Alberto is about everything he has done so far, including all his mistakes (although we doubt there were many…), we are proud that Alberto took the time to talk with us. We are looking forward to intensifying our collaboration with Startup Europe Partnership and Mind the Bridge in the months and years to come. Can you provide us with a brief overview of how your startup engagement started? Mind the Bridge was founded in 2007 with the idea of creating a bridge between Italy and Silicon Valley and the ultimate goal to foster entrepreneurship and startups in Italy. Along the years, we have been asked to replicate our model in other countries and so we started our international growth. We currently pursue two main objectives: (1) We support corporates trying to get involved in the startup ecosystem and (2) we are working to create a stronger and richer startup ecosystem in Europe. Startup Europe Partnership is creating more and more awareness. What is your role and what has been achieved to date? The European Commission launched two main initiatives to foster startup-corporate collaboration at WEF in Davos in January 2014. We have been asked to take the lead in one of the two, called Startup Europe Partnership (SEP). The task was to launch the first pan-European open innovation platform, creating a bridge between startups and corporates. Since then, we have organized more than 20 matching events involving 40+ corporates and 400+ startups and we are aware of 15 deals already being closed directly through our scouting and matching activities. Knowing how many hurdles startups still face today, I can hardly imagine the situation 10 years ago. How did the ecosystem change from your perspective? No comparison is possible; it was a different geological era. When we started, the European startup ecosystem was still in its infancy. Today startups are all over Europe – in every country and city – that is a “shocking” difference! All this is certainly very positive, but it is just the beginning. If we look at scaleups (startups that are able to grow and produce revenue and employment) the number is very limited. Based on our research, there are probably not more than a thousand in Europe. Not enough. But this small number is a direct consequence of the normal lifecycle of everything. The Venture Capital industry started to take off in the ‘70s in Silicon Valley, in the ‘90s in New York and around ’05-’10 in the UK. The German VC industry started just a few years ago and in Southern and Eastern Europe the venture capital game is about to start now. Things take time to mature and produce results, i.e. scaleups. If you look at the European startup vision, one can almost identify two different paths: (A) Trying to copy as much as possible from Silicon Valley, bundle resources and create a European SV or (B) leverage the diversity of Europe and essentially follow a fragmentation strategy. Although black-and-white, where are we leaning towards? Competing with SV is certainly a losing game. The difference is simply too big. SV is and will remain the only startup cluster in the world without a clear specialization. Europe is very different. We have many small hubs from London to Germany, from France to the Nordics. More and more hotspots are coming up as we speak (look at Lisbon). Europe by definition is diverse, that’s what we need to build on. If you look back, what are you most proud of and what would you have done differently? I am proud of everything I have done. This explicitly includes all my mistakes, which have been numerous. In terms of achievements, creating the Startup Europe Partnership as the European open innovation hub and subsequently putting the topic of startup-corporate collaboration high on many people’s agenda, incl. the European Commission (see the recent Scale-up Manifesto), has been quite a challenge. Similarly launching the first official European mission to Silicon Valley (SEC2SV – Startup Europe Comes to Silicon Valley) with the goal to initiate a high level dialogue between European and US corporates, investors and policy makers is something a lot of people give us some credit for. But certainly, there is huge room for improvements. Identifying the most effective forms of startup-corporate collaboration, involving more corporates, in particular mid-size corporates – the true backbone of European economy – is crucial. Looking at 2017 – What do you expect? Is there a tech bubble ongoing? That’s a good question, but I would not speak about a bubble as such. When you are in the Valley, there certainly is the perception that things heated up too much. Europe is different, I have not seen a similar sentiment (at least not yet). Still, we are all taking too many “startup drugs” and we need to get a little sober. Although we haven’t got a proper hangover, I start having a bit of a headache.","14.

But what’s next? Originally from England, Chris Morgan dived into the media industry straight out of Oxford’s PPE* degree. Having started his career at BBC Magazines division, he progressed to Publicitas to launch his career in international media. Currently, he is at the forefront of the digital world with a cutting-edge tech startup Sentifi. With decades of media experience and as a witness to the first phase of the digital media era, our Match-Maker and media industry expert sat down with us to share his insights. *Philosophy, Politics and Economics You recently rediscovered yourself in the startup landscape. What was your career journey? I was in at the start of the digital era, or Digital 1.0, which was quite a difficult time to be in media because of the crash that happened around 2000. It was a difficult time for media companies trying to understand what the dynamics of the digital media landscape would be, and then they had this terrible experience with the first crash. My career became 100% digitally focused after 2007, so I lived through that print to digital transformation and helped Publicitas to go through that transformation process. I’ve had a corporate background up until this year, and after Publicitas shut down in most European markets, including Switzerland where I have been based since 2010, that was my springboard to get serious about the startup world. Working with Match-Maker Ventures since May and joining Sentifi – a media and finance tech startup – in October became my launch pad into the startup world. How has the media industry transformed? When I started my career, print was still a dominant sector of the overall media spending in the media landscape. The key change I’ve seen in the digital landscape has been ‘programmatic’. I first started reading and learning about ad networks and ad exchanges around 2010. Programmatic is more than mainstream now, accounting for up to 80% of ad spend in selected countries in Europe. It was incredible to witness the start of programmatic industry. To me it’s the most dramatic driver of change in the business, hand in hand with the emphasis on buying audience and using data to drive marketing decisions. The industry moved from focusing on context and media environment as a proxy for audience, to a conversation only about audience – meaning data-driven marketing and using data to buy audiences. Now we are coming full circle, understanding that both data-driven media buying and premium contextual environment are extremely important for ensuring brand safety. We realised the need to better understand the context of where the message is delivered and to whom it’s delivered. How is the startup scene within the digital marketing industry? I think it’s extremely dynamic. Not to discourage anyone from getting involved in startups, but it’s also extremely difficult to be successful. I’ve seen how hard it is to make a living out of it and differentiate oneself. The startup scene is full of driven, intelligent and fun people but it’s very challenging to find that positioning in the marketplace where you can shine without a hundred other people doing the same thing as you are. The startup village at DMEXCO was my recent experience of digital startups and a great signal that there are still a lot of interesting new players coming into this competitive landscape. In other words, the potential is huge yet being successful in this industry is very hard? You either have to have something very distinctive about your business model, or something special about your particular asset… Or maybe there’s a barrier to entry for other players? So it’s very difficult to make that space for yourself when there are many other startups doing something similar or pushing the same agenda as you’re pushing. It’s very dynamic and there’s a lot at stake – the digital advertising market is so big and there’s a lot to play for. But differentiating yourself is very hard because everyone wants a piece of the pie. That’s why you need the support of organisations like Match-Maker Ventures to help startups reach out to corporate partners and customers. What was your key takeaway from DMEXCO? What an enormous player Amazon advertising quickly became. I can see companies growing up around the Amazon advertising platform, facilitating access to it and helping businesses to take advantage of the power of Amazon’s advertising offer. It will hopefully spawn a very strong startup scene around it when it becomes more mature and when SMEs start to take notice of it. What developments do you foresee in the startup scene? It very difficult to predict what will come through in the next 5-10 years. My gut feeling is that we will be talking about ‘programmatic everything’, and will be calling it ‘digital marketing’ with the assumption that it is driven by automated systems in the background. I was recently reading an article that said that the next step for digital is not about IoT (Internet of Things) and voice, it’s actually about audio – programmatic radio and audio advertising. A few weeks ago, at the Programmatic Advertising Day in Switzerland, I heard an interesting presentation from Splicky, which is a DSP capable of managing programmatic out-of-home media buying. What about FAANG*’s market domination? There is no reason to think that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix won’t be huge dominant forces also in the future. Probably the dynamics and legislative landscape around these companies will change because of the recent controversies that we’ve seen which caused reputation damage at least… These companies became huge so fast, they are bound to have issues, such as how they manage personal data. It doesn’t mean that it will existentially threaten these giant American players, but we’ll have to keep a careful eye on how those big platforms develop and how consumers use them in the future. *Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google Your professional path led you to Sentifi. What is special about this startup? Sentifi is a very interesting company in my mind – I see it somehow as a synthesis of some of these trends that we’ve talked about. Sentifi uses cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to solve the problem of how to make sense of enormous quantities of data generated around the subject of financial services and financial assets. That’s a great example of how cutting-edge technologies can transform both our business and personal lives and help make sense of that crowded data landscape. What Sentifi does, it taps into the context trend: it makes sense of data and resurfaces that data in a premium environment and a premium context. It also helps you contextualise that data around the subjects that are happening in the world. It’s about premium media, finding the right audience, driving utility to users, helping investors and financial decision-makers to make sense of that cloud of data that surrounds these topics. How do you see your Match-Maker role at Match-Maker Ventures? I think the Match-Maker model is very interesting. I like the Corp-Up model. As someone in my previous role who tried to drive innovation from within the corporate, I’ve seen how difficult it is. To my mind, the Match-Maker model can be very helpful to those companies that are struggling with innovation. This idea of bringing together the best of the startup world with corporates who are looking to innovate but don’t necessarily have the internal capabilities to do so – I’ve lived it from the other side and have seen how useful it could’ve been to have a company like Match-Maker Ventures in the mix to drive corporate innovation. For some of these companies in the media branch, it’s ‘innovate or die’ – which is why Match-Maker Ventures can be such a powerful partner for them.","3.

"26","https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-erik-pfannmoller/","MatchMakerVentures","Customer service & chatbots: Interview with Erik Pfannmöller, Solvemate","We invited Erik Pfannmöller, CEO / Founder of Solvemate as a guest speaker to give his view on the importance of customer experience and chatbots in customer service improvement. Solvemate provides a cutting-edge and proven platform to automate customer support based on deep-learning and chatbot technology. How did you come up with the chatbot startup idea? Prior to founding Solvemate I was leading an e-commerce company as founder and CEO. We had 15 customer service agents dealing with 250.000 service requests per year and I noticed three problems: 1) customer satisfaction dropped dramatically as waiting times increased, 2) turn-over in the customer support team was higher than any other department, due to the repetitiveness of their work, and 3) it was too expensive to do anything about it. I am a big math nerd and have always found machine learning exciting. Now I saw a real case for building a company to solve a massive problem. What main challenges do organisations face in customer support nowadays? In addition to the above mentioned steady pressure to bring down costs for customer support while maintaining a high quality, big corporates face the digitalization issue. In big call centers we have seen technology that is 5-10 years old which just is not (yet) compatible with lightweight Software-as-a-Service solutions like Solvemate. There is technical debt existing, that needs to be tackled. Today, in the customer service industry, we are in the era of solutions based on chatbots, deep learning and AI, will this continue or what’s next? Yes, this development will continue. Our whole society is moving towards an “instant economy”, which means that we want all product and services available whenever, wherever and in real-time. This trend will continue and chatbots will be a solution to make customer support instant and affordable. What are the reasons any organisation should invest in their customer service approach and infrastructure? And any do’s and don’ts you would like to recommend? Invest: Increased satisfaction leads to more loyal customers that buy more. Transform your service agents into consultants and give their work renewed meaning. Do’s / don’ts: DO think about the customer and what they want to achieve – finding a solution to their problem as soon as possible. DO NOT force customers down one path. People have different preferences and some people will still choose to wait 10min for someone to pick up the phone over solving the problem in 12seconds with a chatbot. Customers will learn and preferences will change. Looking at your experience in building startups, which main barriers do you recon still exist between startups and corporations? Moving fast in startups vs slow decision making in corporates. In addition to that, we sometimes see that corporates expect significant results without the clear willingness to invest into Proof of Concepts. Can you share specific success stories from your partnerships with corporations? On www.solvemate.com/customers you can find a selection of customer success stories. One we did with one of the leading German Banks – Sparkasse. Find it at www.solvemate.com/sparkasse. You have recently entered a strategic partnership with MMV. What were the reasons and what do you expect as a result from that? MMV brings with it a unique network of well seasoned industry professionals, with deep network into our target markets. This type of people are not possible for a startup to hire, so partnering with MMV will enable us to open more doors in a shorter amount of time, than we would on our own.

"27","https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-mario-mayerthaler/","MatchMakerVentures","Corp-up in Telecom: Interview with Mario Mayerthaler, A1 Group","An insider view on corporate-startup collaboration. We invited Mario Mayerthaler, Head of A1 Group Innovation Telekom Austria, as a guest speaker to outline how A1 is approaching the startup opportunity and what lessons were learned. A1 is actively engaging with startups through its Startup Campus, as well as directly through its different business units. Why does A1 collaborate with startups? As a leading telco in its footprint, A1 is the pacemaker in terms of digitalization for B2B and B2C. Digitalization itself opens up new possibilities and we want to create the ecosystem together with startups. We see that startups are going into verticals in which we are not present, or that startups extend the value chain in verticals in which we are. As such, we are trying to create value together, offering different models of collaboration between startups and us as group. We are searching for innovation, revenues and spirit, and we are very happy with the developments. What do you point out as the key success factors for corporations wanting to maximize impact from startup collaboration? From my perspective, it is quite simple: Expectation Management: Promise only what you can deliver. It is absolute useless to promise guidelines and deals that will not come to the ground. Be honest: Some things in a big corporate take time, but as a corporate you really have to make it happen Secure your backing: If you are responsible for cooperation with startups, secure your backing and your guidance…and use it! Which main barriers still exist between startups and corporations? Most startups believe (and they must believe) that their products are the best in the world, so it must be quite easy for corporates to sell these products. But it is not. Corporates have quite high margins on their core products, and are driven by revenue goals in core business – this makes the selling of 3rd party products difficult. On the other side, corporates often do not understand that those 3rd party products can secure their core revenues in the future. This can happen because, for customers, the additional value added from a 3rd party product might make the difference between a commodity and real value. In general, of course, the way of thinking is different in itself: startups are eager and fast, corporates are slower but structured and process-oriented. These are two different worlds and that makes it all so interesting. Can you share specific success stories from A1 in your engagement with Startups? I would take out two real success stories: Parkbob Parkbob digitalizes cities, meaning that they create an on-street inventory of parking rules and restrictions. So at the moment they know, in 40 cities in Europe and in the US, where you are allowed to park and where not, where you need to pay for parking and where not, etc. They are the only ones who have this inventory, and the interest from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers is quite high. This year, Parkbob will increase the number of digitalized cities to 100, because they have a unique technology enabling them to do that super fast. Ready2Order R2O created a best-in-class cash registry solution for all operating systems, available through a subscription model on mobile, desktop and tablet. They are a market leader in Austria and are now heading to Germany. Last year they made EUR 2,6 Mio worth of revenues, and their team is composed by 45 FTE – all that only 3 years after founding! We are really proud of that development as now we are truly picking up the pace and, due do legal restrictions, there is everywhere in Europe a need for such solutions. Overall, we see that our program is working out quite well, as all the startups have investors and growing KPIs.","29.

"28","https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-maxime-bayen/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Maxime Bayen (GSMA)","Learnings from the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Programme. Being only over a year and a half old, the Ecosystem Accelerator Programme has established a lot. They successfully educate the market about the benefits of partnerships between operators and innovators and just announced the first nine startups, that have been selected for their innovation fund. During our interview and the time, we spent with Maxime and his team working on our joint report “Opening Doors”, we could feel their passion for fostering startup-corporate collaboration and their excitement for innovative ideas in the mobile services space. We enjoyed working together and look forward to fruitful collaboration between Match-Maker Ventures and the GSMA in the months and years to come. Can you provide us with a brief overview of what Ecosystem Accelerator Programme is and what is the mission of the programme? GSMA is an organisation representing the interests of mobile operators worldwide, uniting nearly 800 operators with almost 300 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The Ecosystem Accelerator programme was launched in early 2016 by the GSMA with the objective to scale innovative and sustainable mobile services in emerging markets through partnerships between mobile operators and start-ups. Today in emerging markets, mobile operators have reached the scale that start-ups lack, while start-ups have the local innovation mobile operators need. The Ecosystem Accelerator Programme is aiming to scale innovative and sustainable mobile services in emerging market through partnerships between operators and innovators. What is your role and what has been achieved to date? The GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator works to bridge the gap between operators and innovators, enabling strong partnerships that support the growth of commercially sustainable mobile products and services. We are doing this mainly through two initiatives. Firstly, knowledge sharing and advocacy to educate both parties on the benefits of these partnerships and the best approach to make them successful (see our latest insight here). Secondly, an Innovation fund that provides selected start-ups in Africa and Asia with grant funding, technical assistance, and the opportunity to partner with mobile operators in their markets, to help scale their products and services into sustainable businesses with positive socio-economic impact. We have actually just announced the first nine start-ups selected by our Innovation Fund. Why does it need external help to foster startup-corporate collaboration? In the specific case of collaboration between mobile operators and start-ups in emerging markets, while some collaborations have already taken place successfully and without external help (recent examples include Eneza and Safaricom in Kenya or WowBox and Telenor in Bangladesh), engaging and setting up these partnerships remains a complicated journey for both sides. The differences in terms of culture, organisation, execution speed and expectations are tremendous between mobile operators and start-ups. Although we are convinced that this journey will become easier on both sides as a number of mobile operators are gearing up to set up clear processes and allocate staff and budget to it, in the meantime we are trying – at our scale – to enable and facilitate this journey. If you look at mobile operators in emerging markets, what are the key challenges for start-ups to successfully collaborate with MNOs and how does this differ to more advanced markets? This is what we dive into in our latest insight co-authored with Match Maker Ventures (Opening Doors: A Start-Up’s Guide to Working With Mobile Operators in Emerging Markets). There are four main challenges alongside the four steps of this engagement and collaboration journey: (1) Start-ups might not be familiar with the trends, challenges and needs of the mobile industry and the mobile operators, (2) It is difficult for start-ups to find out within their country, and their market, which mobile operator to engage with and which person(s) at this operator to reach out to. (3) Pitching to a mobile operator remains a very different exercise than pitching to an investor (which start-ups are usually more familiar with). (4) Setting up a collaboration with a mobile operator and steering it requires a lot of effort and dedication from the start-up’s side. Once again, this is even more the case in emerging markets as those collaborations are still quite rare and hence start-ups might find themselves in a situation where they are the first start-up working on setting up a partnership with a given mobile operator. Likewise what are the key challenges for MNOs? The situations vary quite significantly from one mobile operator to another depending on whether or not the collaboration with local start-ups is a key topic on the top management agenda. Today most mobile operators in emerging markets we are talking to are keen to work with local start-ups. However, they are all at different stages when it comes to turning this willingness into a reality. One critical challenge to overcome is accepting that working with local start-ups is risky and might only pay off in the long term, while mobile operators are under quarterly commercial pressure. Beyond this initial top management buy-in, challenges like human resources and know-how, but also difficulties in sourcing the right start-ups, are making this journey harder. Looking at start-ups that were selected in the first round of the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund, what are the three factors that make you believe it would be a good match with a mobile operator? As was highlighted recently by a mobile operator in a panel that we hosted at Africa Tech Summit London, it is difficult for a mobile operator to work with a start-up at pre-revenue stage. This is why one of the criteria for start-ups to be eligible in the Innovation Fund is revenue: they need to be already generating revenue. A second and critical point we look at is how the start-ups are using mobile technology in their core activity (mobile application but also USSD, SMS, IoT etc.). Lastly, one key question we ask start-ups to answer when they apply to the fund online is about the kind of collaboration they foresee having with local mobile operators, what would they need from them and why it would make sense for mobile operators to collaborate. If you think back, what are you most proud of and what would you have done differently to help start-ups and mobile operators to work together? With the programme being just over a year and a half old, when we look back only a little bit, there was initially nothing at all. So we are quite excited that in such a short time we have been able to put this programme and its team together. One of the things we want to improve on is the traction the Innovation Fund got in Asia. Close to 70% of the 400+ applications we received during the first round of the innovation came from African start-ups and 30% from Asian entrepreneurs. While this is great as this shows the dynamism of the African tech ecosystem, we are working hard now to encourage more start-ups from emerging markets in Asia to apply. For the second round of the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund, what do you expect? For the second edition, it was decided to keep the criteria as they were for the first one, specifically when it comes to the two innovation focus areas. As it was the case for the first round we will be supporting start-ups in two innovation focus areas: the Sharing economy and Services for SMEs.","10.

"29","https://www.match-maker.ventures/interview-with-monika-kuschewsk/","MatchMakerVentures","Interview with Monika Kuschewsky (Squire Patton Boggs)","An expert opinion on GDPR – MMV talked to Monika Kuschewsky. Monika Kuschewsky is partner in the global Data Privacy and Cybersecurity practice at Squire Patton Boggs. With over 15 years of experience in data protection, she now concentrates on GDPR with a special focus on topics like IoT, “Bring Your Own Device”-policies, international data transfers as well as customer and employee data protection. We had the pleasure to talk to her about her views on GDPR readiness of companies around the globe and why GDPR is not the end of data monetization. From your perspective as partner in a global law firm, what will be the implications of GDPR beyond the EU? Will other countries adopt similar regulations? Already the EU Data Protection Directive, the predecessor of the GDPR, has been used as a standard in other regions of the world like Latin America or Asia, so I think there will be the same trend when it comes to the GDPR. Even more so, because of the higher sanctions and stricter enforcement under the GDPR <U+0336> there are also a number of countries that want to enable their companies to still do business with Europe and will, therefore, follow the EU data protection framework. Are the big multinationals from the US worried about GDPR at all? They for sure are closely monitoring and following this process. They have already started to adjust their internal compliance frameworks to the GDPR, because they know they have to comply with the GDPR if they want to continue to offer their goods and services in the EU. In my experience, many big multinationals are already well advanced and have built internal teams dealing with the GDPR. By contrast, especially SMEs are still in the process of figuring out if they are even subject to the GDPR. A survey conducted by Dell about a year ago found out that most companies are not ready when it comes to GDPR. In your experience, are companies more prepared today? I think that a lot more companies are more advanced in their preparation today, but I would be surprised if there are any that are fully compliant, since there are a lot of issues in flux. Some aspects of the GDPR may be further regulated by national law, like data processing in the employment context, so companies are still waiting for national laws to be implemented on those topics. And the data protection authorities are expected to issue guidance. A lot of companies have started with auditing their current level of compliance and building a roadmap on how to become GDPR compliant by May 2018 and most companies have advanced on that work plan, but they are far from being ready. There are certainly more organizations that have taken steps than a year ago. Nevertheless, we are still talking to businesses today that haven’t done anything regarding GDPR. This is not only the case for SMEs – also some larger companies are waiting for budget approval or are still trying to understand to what extent they will be subject to the GDPR and who should be responsible internally. Of course, today data protection has become an issue which is discussed at board level, but often there are no actions matching these discussions. Mostly the budgets are still the same as pre GDPR, even though the complexity of the changes that need to be made would require higher budgetary commitments. Additionally, complicating the issue is the fact that the task of making an organization GDPR compliant is often given to a person that has other day-to-day activities, leaving them with little time for this complex matter. In light of BYOD, shadow IT, or the rise of IoT devices – isn’t GDPR readiness of an organization more about education and less about strict processes? In my view, it is a combination of both, as one does not work without the other. If you look at the statistics, a major reason for data getting lost, or being leaked, is employees not being familiar with rules or making mistakes. By training and increasing awareness you are reducing the risk, but you will never get rid of it entirely by just educating staff. The best training needs to be supplemented by processes and technical as well as organisational controls. Just to give an example: You can allow your employees to bring their own device, but you will need to have a proper policy framework around it. Moreover, you need to ensure that company data is secured and, for example, only accessed through encrypted VPN channels or by using sandboxing technology. How big of an impact do you think the stricter rules for consent generation have on new business, like data monetization? These stricter consent rules are certainly posing a challenge for many new sectors and ideas such as data monetization. To the extent that companies depend on consent, certainly business will not get easier in that regard. However, the first step should be to ask whether an organization can process personal data without consent; in other words, if there is another legal basis for data processing – because it is so difficult to obtain consent. However, there are a number of business models where consent is unavoidable. Then, it is a matter of coming up with creative consent mechanisms and tools, to make the consent experience as smooth and easy for the individuals as possible. But it certainly will not be easy. Anyways, I would not want to say that this is the end of new business and data monetization. If I look at the consent rules, they are to some extent very similar to existing rules in Germany, and businesses in Germany have coped with those rules in the past. Overall, (new) business is all about inventing and creating new things and ideas, so I am confident that companies will come up with innovative ways to deal with it.","6.

"38","https://www.match-maker.ventures/startups-corporates-2-different-worlds-interview-with-attila-keszeg/","MatchMakerVentures","Startups & corporates: Two different worlds. Interview with Attila Keszeg","The best of both worlds. Attila Keszeg is a Hungarian-born C-level telecom executive (Deutsche Telekom, Hungarian Telekom, GO) with a 20 year-long journey in FMCG (Pepsi, Red Bull). We got together with Attila to discuss the intersections between the corporate and startup worlds and to get his advice for both parties. What lessons did you learn from working in FMCG? I’m a mechanical engineer but my fortune brought me to FMCG and I stayed there for nearly 20 years. What I learned in FMCG is to focus on customers and perfect execution on the market. There is no 2-year contract to protect you, you need to win the heart of the customer from one shopping trip to another. If your product is available on the shelf, it may be considered. To win, it needs to be relevant, credible and resembling positive brand image. 10 years in Pepsi was a great school for sales and attention to details. 6 years in Red Bull was a perfect school for marketing. What you need to win: 1. Customer focus 2. Relentless execution 3. Attention to detail 4. Excellent sales and marketing Did your past experiences intersect with the telecom industry? Around 2010 I switched industries and went into telecommunications. I was able to convert the know-how and knowledge of my FMCG learnings, especially customer centricity, customer experience, people management, product design aimed at meeting customer needs, and ensuring the right product reaches the right segment. In FMCG, just like in telecom, you are able to achieve your results through people, through selecting the right team and developing it. That’s what I did. We were able to grow profitability by generating greater value from the existing customer base. I’m a great believer in quality, and I’m sure that customers do not want the cheap product, they want the right product. In your roles you had a close relationship with startups. What were the biggest challenges? I was always a big corporate guy, not a startup guy. Big processes, deadlines, KPIs… I struggled with startups at the beginning. I found startups a very interesting phenomenon. I thought they were eating my cake and saw them as competitors. Luckily, I came to the realisation that they are more of a solution, not a problem. I went to Silicon Valley, London, Tel Aviv, and by meeting startup communities I started to understand the way they are working, how they can complement, or even upgrade, what large telecoms are offering. We started to create so called umbrellas, such as security, cross-sell/up-sell, customer experience, TV. There were always very nice startups ready to collaborate. How did you manage to combine the two worlds? Learning how to speak startup language is crucial. Startups and corporates are 2 different worlds. My strength was coming from the corporate side. I know how they think, what their strengths and weaknesses are. We had a lot of bitter startup experiences, we went in too soon and put a corporate structure onto startups. It was suffocating them. They don’t think deadlines like corporates. Demanding the same is naïve – startups are unable to provide the same level reports, KPIs, what a large corporate would enforce. We had to be conscious about what to do and what not to do. We created the greenhouse around startups, nurturing and protecting them at difficult financial times. I was part of Production Innovation Board (PIB), able to influence product development direction and resource allocation. “Make-buy-partner” question is critical for a large corporate. Being a board director of a Berlin-based startup immmer (Deutsche Telekom’s “WhatsApp” currently converted into Magenta Button, an in-house developed chatbot), made me an insider of the startup world. I know enough about the startups to speak the right corporate language to create a perfect environment for a corporate not to rush the decision and return on investment. I know how to integrate the startup into the value creation, how not to compete with your own product development and how to rely more on startups. Top 3 recommendations for startups 1. Ensure there is a clear customer, be practical and target to solve that particular painpoint. I’ve seen many cases how startup developers are too in love with their product and it is not clear what the startup is solving. Have an eye on the user, ensure anyone can use your solution if targeting broad masses. If using your solution requires certain technical knowledge, then you’re developing for experts, not masses. Ensure intuitive usage. 2. Collaborate. There is a lot of openness and collaboration with other startups, reaching out to complement each other’s solutions and combining efforts. Remain collaborative with their future target segments – banks, telcos, make sure sure you have an eye in the market. 3. Spend enough time on the go-to-market and how you will deliver your product to the target audience. This is where matchmakers are coming in – understanding startups, identify channels, how to scale solution.. There are great techy guys who just don’t know how to ensure that the solution reaches the target audience. Top 3 recommendations for corporates 1. Consider startups first before investing in your own development or buying – could be faster and cheaper. In make-buy-partner order should be turned upside down. There is a startup solution for everything. You want to land on the moon – there will be 10 startups working on that this very moment. Why waste time? 2. Scale up very quick. Ensure value creation and improved services are reaching the masses of the corporate customers. Have a purpose, commitment and scale up quick to upgrade your service. 3. Be practical, use the startup for the right purpose. Avoid checklist “startuping”. Don’t do startup management for the sake of the buzzword. Be solution-oriented. Why did you join Match-Maker Ventures as a Match-Maker? I knew about MMV right from the start. I always appreciated what MMV is doing, as I was doing something very similar within Deutsche Telekom – scouting startups, nurturing them and integrating them into corporates. Joining MMV allowed me to utilise my experience and work on something I really enjoy. If you could start your life over, would you choose the same industry to work in? I don’t regret working for FMCG, but I would switch earlier to telco, and most probably the whole startup arena. This is where I see a lot of excitement. When you have millions of startups you need to decide what is good, what is bad, and what is genius. You need experience for that, and I would enter this scene way earlier if I could.","4.

With over 25 years of experience in Strategic Consulting, Public Affairs, Campaigning, Change Communications, Litigation PR and Governmental Relations, he shared his insights on the state of innovation in Switzerland and Farner’s perspectives on startups and corporates. Looking at the Swiss market, in which area (industries) do you see most of the progress being made when it comes up to innovation? And where do you see the biggest challenges? I see most progress in Innovation in Switzerland around the technical universities ETH / EPFL (Federal Universities in Zürich and Lausanne), then in the field of Life Sciences and Health Care (around the pharmaceutical industry in the Basle Area) and growing in Fintech (around Zurich). You are a member of Innovation Board at Farner. Can you share some of the objectives and experiences so far? Each business should be aware of the innovative potential of his own staff and give incentives for good ideas. Farner’s Innovation Board supports and evaluates innovative projects coming from our staff on base of approved business plans. Until now, we realised in the first year two successful projects: The Farner Issue Manager – an automatised search engine to monitor key issues in the parliaments on communal, cantonal and federal level and a full influencer data bank. On the startup side, how is communication helping startups at an early stage of their business idea? And to what degree do you see startups really leveraging the impact of communication? Investors must understand new business ideas before they invest. Many founders are not aware, that the view of the investor differs from the perspective on the business of the entrepreneur. So the right equity story plays a key role in successfully funding a business idea. On the corporate side, to what degree do you see companies sharing openly their innovation experiences and lessons learned with others to improve? And how is Farner helping companies in this regard? In Switzerland we have meanwhile a lot of corporate venturing. Farner has a dense network to big corporates as clients for communication services. We offer this network to startups to help them, to find access to big companies. What are your views on corporates driving innovation with startups? Is it working? Are there best practices out there? There are mixed experiences. Some corporates are too slow and too cumbersome to successfully scout startups. That’s why we are looking to cooperate with partners like Match-Maker Ventures to provide professional B2B connecting services.","13.

The term in itself became a ‘trendy’ topic of discussion, and likewise more and more corporates are experimenting their way into startup innovation. We felt it was time to get back in the field and investigate what has changed over the past 3 years, what is the current state of play, and what to expect going forward. After all, is startup-corporate collaboration a pain or a gain? On this new study, conducted jointly with Arthur D. Little, and with the support of 8 contribution partners, we managed to outperform the number of participants from the first publication and build an even more representative sample. Over the past months, we surveyed 340 corporate and 203 startup participants from more than 70 countries. In addition, to provide in-depth insights, we discussed the topic of collaboration in 1:1 interviews with a total of 50 successful entrepreneurs and corporate innovation experts. What can you expect from the study? More collaboration, more focus, more impact: startup-corporate collaboration is now a “mass market” phenomenon. We present how corporates and startups are approaching it in 2019. The rise of Corp-Up: commercially focused partnerships (Corp-Up) emerge as the most common and the least stopped engagement approach. We show how both sides can choose the most suitable collaboration setup. The way forward: the majority of corporates still shows an underwhelming level of collaboration activity and quality.

We invited Marco Bosma, VP Fintech & Innovation at Rabobank, as a guest speaker to give his view on startup-corporate collaboration and share some success stories of Rabobank. Marco is a Fintech advocate driving innovations in the financial services for Rabobank. Next to his role at Rabobank, Marco is a member of the Dutch Blockchain coalition, Robo Valley and Brightlands techruption. Marco has worked in various international management roles at Citibank, ThomsonReuters, ABNAMRO, RBS and Rabobank always translating client demand into technology and data delivery solutions. Why and how does Rabobank collaborate with startups? We have to! Many value chains in financial services are re-inventing themselves today. In this process, existing value chains are challenged and disrupted. The reason why this is happening now is that numerous new technologies have become available such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and blockchain. At the same time, legislation such as Basle IV, GDPR and PSD2 is coming into force aiming to establish a level playing field for new entrants focusing on a particular step in new value chains. You can image that the spectrum of what a bank can cover has exponentially grown. As a result of this, it is impossible for a us to cover this on our own so hence we have no other choice than partnering with startups who are dedicated to build, extend or improve our value chains. Can you share to what degree and in what area do startups help you to drive your corporate innovation agenda? We have focused on retail propositions that can be split in customer service, integrated dashboards and cross needs identification, as well as process improvements such as KYC, AML and product fulfillments like opening- and closing accounts, providing loans and mortgages (Robotics Process Automation). The lesson is that we learn a lot from the ways of working, and have started to adopt design thinking and lean startup approaches, this is all generic so it’s impacting innovation management across the bank. In your view, what have been the main challenges in collaborating with startups so far? What can startups and corporations do to overcome them? I have to make a distinction between in-house developed startup ideas, and external startups that we are engaging with. In terms of setting the right environment to collaborate with external startups, we start by looking at the people. Is this a team that can deliver? Is it diversified enough or do we need to add certain skills or experience to make it successful? Clearly the proposition has to be complementary to Rabobank and synergize with our innovation strategy. The culture is often mentioned. Yes it is important, but not in terms that they have to match. Startups by definition have a different working culture and a different operating pace. You need to find a modus to preserve that. I have not yet met a startup that likes to fully integrate into a bank and pursue life in a corporate career. What would be your advice to startups that want to succeed in the financial services sector? Focus on your strengths and be honest to yourselves in judging the business case. Often the value is in the proposition and the unique expertise, less often in distribution. Many startups do not make it because they are falling into the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) trap. I have seen many ventures who realized too late that the CAC are exceeding the Lifetime Customer Value. So focus on the proposition and find the right distribution partners to reach mass market at low cost. Many collaborations between startups and banks are driven on this win/win aspect in the partnership. Can you share specific success stories from Rabobank in your engagement with startups? We have acquired and built many assets since 2012. We started in the mobile payment area with propositions such as MyOrder and Omnikassa. Later we have added SmartPin, Facturis, Rabo & Co, Peaks, Tellow, Surepay, EasyTrade, Moovement and Go Credible. Some are home grown, some are partnerships with IT or Platform providers. The success is determined by the scalability – the pace (and costs) new users can be on-boarded. Our experience is that you have to allow 3-4 years before new services really get traction. And not to mention you have to be prepared to kill projects when teams struggle too long to determine a marketable proposition. This frees up time to focus on the promising stuff. Banks will need a rich successful portfolio of new propositions to keep client engagement and grow its revenues.","25.

It offers credit cards for the world’s leading brands to more than 2.4 million cardholders and tens of thousands of businesses worldwide. In 2015, Visa CAL launched a new product, becoming the first Israeli firm to offer end-to-end online credit card ordering. The Challenge To assess its customer needs and trends, Visa CAL was using a number of tools including web analytics, application logs, business intelligence (BI) systems and media tools. However, despite all of these tools, the company did not have a complete picture of the user experience on their website. The key areas that Visa CAL wanted insights about included: The customer journey within the company’s card ordering system Delays experienced by customers when using the ordering system Areas on the website in which customers struggled to complete a transaction Customer churn and the reasons behind it The Solution Visa CAL turned to digital experience analytics from Glassbox to get a clearer view of the customer journey when ordering and using Visa CAL credit card products. Drilling into user behavior Visa CAL was able to find and watch session replays during which customers ordered credit cards. Using customizable Glassbox dashboards, they were able to analyze customer behavior, including session duration and the number of changes to fields, which the company suspected were impacting customer churn. Understanding customer intentions with click maps With Glassbox’s powerful digital behavior and customer experience analytics solution, Visa CAL gained an understanding of the intentions and behavior of its customer when ordering and using the company’s credit card products. This information gave Visa CAL a data-driven hypothesis of what they needed to do to make the process more intuitive and customer-friendly. Creating streamlined processes In response, Visa CAL embarked on a new project to look closely at the results from Glassbox and fine-tune every stage of the card ordering journey to ensure it matched the needs of the customer and addressed any areas of friction. The Main Results With the data provided by Glassbox and the changes made by Visa CAL based on it, within three weeks the company was able to triple the conversion rate from 19% to 60%. Glassbox brought about a number of changes to the credit card ordering process, all of which are designed to make it easier and more intuitive for the customer: Unnecessary fields in the order process were removed. Some specific fields only appear for relevant customer segments to streamline the process. Optional fields were moved to the end of the process so up-sell products and services are available once the order has been confirmed. Certain fields were changed from drop-down to free-text. Clearer error messages were added to help customers complete the process. General changes to page structure and design were made, including column structure and fields spread over more pages, to remove clutter and improve UX. ""Thanks to Glassbox, we are now able to record each and every customer action from our site. Using analytics, funnels and associated data, we are able to reach intelligent conclusions on customer behavior and have a continuous improvement action plan in place to ensure we continue to evolve and meet the needs of our customers.""
