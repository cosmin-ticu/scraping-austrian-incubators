There are various schools of thought on which of these should come first. Stanford’s Biodesign program teaches the needs-led approach based on early stakeholder engagement. The age-old “Technology Push” approach starts with IP, and often has to search for or establish an unmet need. Starting with people or money is less common. A deeper dive into case studies of successful MedTech societal impact teaches us that we should consider all of these factors as substitutable. You are almost certainly familiar with examples of pivoting a technology to another unmet need, but how do you build a stronger business case by swapping Intellectual Property, People and Money?  More about the guest speaker: Professor James E. Moore Jr., Ph.D. The Bagrit Chair in Medical Device Design Department of Bioengineering Imperial College London Prof. Moore received his PhD in 1991 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, followed by postdoctoral training at the Swiss Institute of Technology at Lausanne, where he also helped set up a new biomedical engineering lab. In January 2013, he joined Imperial College as the Bagrit Chair in Medical Device Design, and started a new masters program in medical device entrepreneurship. To date, eight spinouts have resulted from this program that have attracted more than £4 million in grant and professional investor funding. Prof. Moore is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. Prof. Moore’s research interests include Cardiovascular Biomechanics, Stents, Implantable Devices, Atherosclerosis, and the Lymphatic System. His research focuses on the role of biomechanics in the formation and treatment of diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. His cardiovascular biomechanics research includes the first studies of the effects of stents on both blood flow patterns and artery wall stress. This work resulted in the development of two novel stent designs aimed at optimizing post-implant biomechanics for the prevention of restenosis. He is currently developing two technologies for preventing and resolving secondary lymphedema, which forms subsequent to cancer surgery. Along with his funding from government, charity, and industry sources, Prof. Moore has received multiple patents for medical devices and testing equipment. Prof. Moore has also co-founded two startup companies, with another two about to emerge.","April 7, 2021","no_image"

Furthermore, brand strategies require fundamental know-how on marketing – a vital obstacle for startups, small or medium enterprises. But without authentic and convincing communication even good ideas remain unseen, their sales under their potential. Guest Lecturer Florian Hämmerle The Viennese branding experts Hämmerle & Luger want to clear up misunderstandings. By focussing on tools that are intuitively applicable they help create and maintain strong brands that do not require any marketing expertise. The workshop „Let me tell you a story … a shortcut to powerful branding“ delivers insights into their core method „Archetypal Branding”. It shows an easy way to focus a brands communication by finding an emotional and meaningful key message.","April 7, 2021","no_image"

The EU Circular Economy Action Plan, alongside the Green Deal, promotes that all products in the EU need to be developed in a sustainable way. This starts with the design for the circularity of products and services but also looking at circular solutions along the entire Value Chain. Looking into circular solutions should become part of the business development of each Spin-off, and it is important to understand that circularity is a lot more than thinking about recyclability. So, quite often the potential of circularity is not explicitly considered when building the business case. In this workshop, you will gather an understanding of which business opportunities exist when applying circular thinking. We will look at tools to identify the potential and how looking into the entire circular value chain can show potential to bring your ideas to an application in business. We will open the minds to see what partners along the circular value chain would need and how you can tap into these opportunities. Based on a case study you will learn how you can use the Circular Canvas to identify solutions by applying good practices of circularity. • Have a good overview of what opportunities for circular business models exist • Know what is required to make your solution more circular • Have experienced working with a powerful tool to activate your team and stakeholders • Get an idea of which steps you can go to further embrace the circular thinking Andreas Ellenberger is Co-Founder and CEO of Circonnact, an organization focusing on the application of circular economy in urban areas, supporting companies and communities to explore, create and implement regenerative circular solutions. For more than 20 years he has been delivering changes successfully in small, medium and large companies and organisations. After graduating in Business Administration at the University of Gießen, Germany, he supported and ran projects and programmes and was IT department lead for a financial services group. 12 years ago, he became a certified project management trainer and developed project governance structures for medium-sized companies and business units. In more than 250 trainings he helped the participants to become well equipped to handle projects and changes with an open mindset and professional methods and tools, always focusing on how to transfer the know-how into the reality of the participants. He organized the collaboration of the Horizon2020 research project Sport Infinity to develop circular sports products and noticed that circular thinking is motivating people to find new innovative solutions and to cooperate. Since 2014 he is actively involved in spreading the ideas of a circular economy, with a focus on how to work in an agile and collaborative way to ensure the implementation is future-proof and based on the contribution of all stakeholders.

Therefore, we asked ourselves, how can startups create actual value and consequently build sustainable business models to avoid this trap? Heads up – there are no such things as checklists which will guarantee the success of a venture! However, working with over 20 European tech scale-ups provided us with valuable insights on what it means to build businesses sustainably. During this session, we will introduce you to our learnings and findings on how to think about value creation and how this translates into a venture’s sustainable growth. Moreover, we will show you why the different approaches of value creation ask for different financing solutions. Last but not least, we will share with you why we, Round2 Capital, pioneered revenue-based finance in the European funding ecosystem since 2017, and how it fits into the big picture of sustainable business building. ——————————————- *** During the event, photographic and video material will be taken.

They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary co-founder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls “the torture.” Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. Great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, “I didn’t quit.” ‘’ Ben Horowitz, author The Hard Thing About Hard Things Being a first-time founder has its blessings and its courses. During this session, we want to talk about the realistic goals of embarking on the exciting and challenging journey of starting your first business. Especially if you have been working in the academia for the past years and you want right now to make the leap and start your own company based on your research results, you will have a better experience starting a spinout if you are armed with some expectations about your likely journey. Spinning-out requires a clear time and usually also money commitment, and its success highly depends on the founder team’s passion, irrational optimism and deep faith the technology they’ve developed. From writing their first business plan to their first investment and scaling up, 4 founders from 4 different TU Wien- affiliated companies in different stages share their experience with transforming their research into successful products or services. At the end of the workshop you will:  Guests: Nermina Mumic – CEO & founder Legitary Nermina graduated with honours from Vienna University of Technology with a master’s degree in Technical Mathematics. After her studies she gained profound experience as a data scientist in a leading global IT consulting company, developing AI solutions for various industry applications. Within the scope of her PhD in Technical Mathematics she developed a new machine learning method for fraud detection in streaming data. Based on her research results, she founded Legitary GmbH as a spin-off from Vienna University of Technology. Legitary is the winner of the world’s leading music startup competition Midemlab. Benjamin Mörzinger – Founder Campfire Solutions I would like to be able to look my future children in the eyes and say that I have done everything to leave them the world as a better place. That’s why I am committed to ensuring that we, at Campfire Solutions, have the right long-term goals and that the team has the perfect environment to be effective. Julie Rosser – CEO Pregenerate As an equine surgeon, I grew frustrated at the lack of effective treatments for arthritis in horses. When I began researching arthritis, I learned first hand the true cost of animal testing in medicine and vowed to establish an alternative. Pregenerate’s Arthritis on a chip is that alternative, enabling pharmaceutical research for arthritis in both the human and veterinary medicine sectors – with a market size greater than $570 billion ","April 7, 2021","no_image"
"21","https://i2c.tuwien.ac.at/event/what-to-consider-when-splitting-the-founding-equity/","I2C","What to consider when splitting the founding equity","Description of the workshop The most successful ventures are founded by entrepreneurial teams rather than individual entrepreneurs, but a large founder team can be problematic as well. In the special case of establishing a university spin-out, the number of founders is likely to be higher, the team members fulfill various roles and have a different level of commitment to the day-to-day running of the company. As a provider of resources and permissions, you can expect the university to become a significant shareholder as well. Splitting the equity equally among university and/or founder researchers might be detrimental to the spin-out in the long-run. So how to make sure everyone gets his / her fair share of equity? This workshop covers important topics like the size of the shareholding, how to split founder equity dos and don’ts and possible consequences, how to tackle founders who don’t commit 100% or want to continue their academic path as well as provide you with some tools to ease the process of splitting the founder’s pie. At the end of the workshop you will: Guest Lecturer Lucanus is Founder and Managing Partner of Calm/Storm Ventures, a founder network and boutique venture capital firm based in Vienna, Austria. Prior to founding his own fund, he was a General Partner at Speedinvest where he personally led investments focused on digital health companies including Playbrush, Ourpath, or Diagnosia. Prior to Speedinvest, Lucanus was managing director of whatchado.com a portfolio company of Hansi Hansmann’s “hansmengroup”. Lucanus holds Master degrees in Entrepreneurship (WU Vienna) and International Management (CEMS). Lucanus is passionate about supporting founders with purpose. He helps entrepreneurs solving problems that really matter by leveraging his nearly 20 years of experience in business & corporate development. As a passionate sailor and father of 3, you’ll find Lucanus spending his spare time with his kids on a boat.","April 7, 2021","no_image"
