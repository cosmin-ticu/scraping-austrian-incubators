Let’s take for example Kickstarter with its more than 17 Mio supporters… yes 17 Mio! That sounds massive, doesn’t it? Nevertheless only 20% of technology projects are successfully funded, while raising on average less than $10,000.With great numbers comes great competition! It’s not only you who is launching but on average there are about 400 other projects online in the tech-space alone. So how can you stand out?To benefit from the platform’s community, you first have to build up your own community – before launching! So once you launch you already have your first supporters queued up. This first push is very important! It helps you to get a decent ranking on the platform, which gives you visibility to the community! Now you can start benefiting from the platform’s community.Crowdfunding Mistake #2: Not telling people that you’re launching via GIPHYUnfortunately, a lot of creators literally forget about the most obvious thing: to make sure everyone knows that their campaign has started and that they need their support now.Be prepared! Make a list of all the people (that includes family and friends) that showed interest. I recommend adding the likelihood of them supporting, so at the end you have a reliable number of first supporters. Once you launch make sure every single one of them knows that you’re live!Don’t forget to post it on your social media channels or other relevant channels, and to send out a newsletter in case you were collecting email addresses upfront.Crowdfunding Mistake #3: Not getting feedback before you launch via GIPHYOn the majority of platforms, you get a preview link of your campaign once you start setting it up. Use this link to gather feedback before you launch. Make sure you send it to people who are not yet aware of your product and ask them for feedback: Is it clear what you are doing? Is any information missing? What needs improvement? Is the video grabbing attention?I can guarantee you, there will be valuable feedback, which will help you make your campaign ever better.Crowdfunding Mistake #4: Not submitting your campaign early enoughCrowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter need to approve your project before you launch. Make sure to submit your project at least one week before your planned and communicated launch. Normally they approve or get back to you within 2-3 days. In case you need to adjust something, you have some buffer days.Crowdfunding Mistake #5: Ignoring seasons via GIPHYLaunching a solar BBQ <U+0001F356> <U+2744><U+FE0F> in winter or Skis in summer <U+0001F3BF><U+0001F334>- does that sound like a good idea? Starting in the wrong season can kill your campaign. Two main reasons: First of all, most supporters don’t care about BBQ in winter or Skis in summer. Secondly the media doesn’t care about it either. Hence it will be really difficult for you to get press coverage. Keep in mind your products “main season” if there is one and launch in that time frame.Keep these 5 mistakes in mind, and never forget: preparation is key to success!Happy launching!","March 6, 2020","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ELEVATE_Breakfast_113-scaled-377x250.jpg"

Bots have evolved to a point where they can provide a new way for customers to interact with brands – in a meaningful and useful way. Consumers crave real-time, efficient, on-demand conversations without hassle. An experience chatbots are already able to perfectly provide today.You have probably already come across chatbots (If not, you might want to check out our blog). Chatbots provide a conversational interface aimed at solving customers’ problems. In simple industries – sure. But is this also possible in more complex cases? Enter insurance chatbots.Making insurances sexy with conversational interfacesThink about the insurance industry, where there is a lot of in-depth communication needed between a business and a client. These insurance processes require time, effort and the filling of a ridiculous amounts of documents – You know the struggle and you probably hate it as much as we do!The Road from paperwork to AIWould you believe us if we tell you there is a better way to do it? By working with an insurance chatbots. To give you a better understanding of the potential of conversational interfaces in this case, let us present to you 5 things we love about insurance bots:Make a claim – 24/7 with insurance chatbotsRecord a claim from your phone and check its status at any time and any place. No calls. No repetitive hold music. No redirection to a call centre halfway around the world. The bot is there for you, 24/7 – No restrictions.Get feedback right awayThe bot will answer your simplest questions so you get feedback not 3-5 business days later, but right away. It works efficiently, quickly and is convenient. Your communication with the bot can happen on the channels of your choice, be it a messenger, mail, voice device or many others.Explain matters only onceYou know how insurance hotlines will redirect you multiple times, forcing you to explain your issue over and over again? Not with chatbots. Conversations are traceable and take protocol so humans can take over at any time.Customer service bots can create incidents and tracks issues – or can alternatively assign them to real employees should the task get too complex.Attach your documentation right awayNo need to fill out documents about how the accident happened and send photos from all angles per mail. Do all of that via bot. With today’s image recognition opportunities, the pictures can be analyzed directly by the bot and processed to further understand what the customer needs.Get information you did not even know you wanted The thing about self-learning bots is: They gets smarter with every question they are being asked! While the Bot can understand your current needs it may even suggest policies you might be interested in at the time – The bot acts as a sales person and adds value to the customer experience.Ready for the insurance revolution?We are happy to help you with an enterprise ready framework for the bots you have been dreaming of.

Developing the business model, validating your idea as well as your MVP, exploring the KPIs which truly count, all the way to reaching product-market-fit. You want to leave an accelerator knowing your pitch, your Go-To-Market strategy and all that other good stuff. That’s the reason you want to join an accelerator in the first place and why we all pour our heart and soul into it . Over the last two batches of ELEVATE, however, we learned that there is even more to it! Personal growth. Constant feedback. A community supporting each other.Looking back on 4,5 months of ELEVATE Batch #2, there was all of that. There were struggles, intense meetup days, motivating feedback sessions with fantastic mentors and great progress in our teams. And then there were also karaoke nights, Austrian dinners, impromptu German lessons and lots and lots of chats, sharing experiences and learnings. Now that Batch #2 is coming to an end and we are already preparing for Demo Day – which is happening on May 23rd (Save the date) – it’s high time to reflect on the highlights and our favorite moments.ELEVATE Moment #1 – Kick-OffThe day we finally got to meet the new teams was definitely a highlight. Our internal IT & Growth Hacking mentors got to meet the teams they would be working with very closely for the following 6 months, supporting them hands-on, week for week. First task: Evaluating, rethinking and upgrading their business model and validating it– a painful but necessary process.Personal Highlight: Introducing the international teams to Schweinebraten & Glühwein – a very typical Austrian dish & drink – at a Christmas market. “When we joined ELEVATE, we had already launched our product, so we were very interested to continue to develop product and go after the customers. But ELEVATE made us take a step back and think more critically about our overall product and key hypotheses. As a result of that we interviewed 2 dozen real estate agents, and we got some very interesting insights that resulted in our product roadmap changes.” – Jatinder Singh, BotplanFavorite Moment #2 – Facebook in the HouseHaving Susann Fischer from Facebook, Markus Brunner from the Facebook Messenger Platform Team, Prashant Pitti from nearGroup and of course our one and only Greg Leuch from Poncho – an all-time Vienna fan – all here in Vienna for a very special mentoring day with our startups was great. Having experienced chatbot startup founders mentoring our teams and sharing their learnings was a fantastic way of giving our startups new perspectives. Ending the day with our Grand Bots Meetup was just the cherry on top!Personal Highlight: This is – again – food-related: A huge ELEVATE dinner with our mentors, teams and the ELEVATE team.Favorite Moment #3 – US Team relocating to ViennaOur team from the US, Polaama relocated to Vienna for the last three months of the program. Having the teams here full-time means work is getting done really fast, the progress is bigger – it also means fun lunch breaks and impromptu German lessons. “Some of my ELEVATE highlights: Working with the ELEVATE team assigned to me, how it feels like a real team and how much we have been able to accomplish as a team” – Madhu Parasarathy, PolaamaFavorite Moment #4 – Progress, progress, progressOur teams and mentors are working incredibly hard to making their visions come to life and making their customers’ lives easier. We know that. But some of the best moments throughout the accelerator program were the ones when we realized how much the teams and their businesses have progressed. Be it after pitching and roasting sessions, progress updates or just in between through conversations with each other. We can’t wait to see what our startups’ future will bring!Personal highlight: All the pitching & roasting sessions, when we’re a bit tough on the teams but they show us just how much is in them!Extra Moment – Karaoke Night! Yes, this has to be mentioned, because it was just too much fun. Who doesn’t like a chill karaoke night after a hard day of work? That’s what we thought, so we got our whole team and the startups together – and we went all out. It was a blast! Who would’ve thought all these people in the accelerator aren’t only talented business people, but got so many other hidden talents? Definitely calls for a rerun! “The gals and guys from TheVentury were great mentors for us. We expected that in a way when we applied. But we didn´t expect they would kill us in Karaoke :)” – Michael Nigsch, ibindoThese were just a few highlights of the last 5 months, just a few words will never be enough to describe the whole journey . So this is just a ”tip of the iceberg” kind of thing – to tell our mentors and our teams how much we value them and how much fun it was. And to give you an idea how we do not just elevate businesses, but also the people behind it.If you are interested in what our teams were working on throughout the program, then request access to our Demo Day (May 23rd).ELEVATE Batch#3 – October 2018ELEVATE is coming back in October 2018 – Join the ELEVATE family! You’ll get hands-on coaching, as well as IT-development and growth marketing support.

And now, for the first time ever, we have opened ELEVATE to established companies. We are thrilled to have RBI on board for our batch 6 with their intrapreneurship team. “By opening the Elevate accelerator program to intrapreneurship teams, we will henceforth offer them an agile and inspiring environment to work side by side with young startups on forward-looking ideas and business models,”– Katharina Binder, Head of AcceleratorAt TheVentury we have been supporting both, startups as well as established companies. Through the years we have experienced the parallels between intrapreneurship teams and early-stage startup teams – the similar needs they have in their most intensive growth phase and the common struggles that they face. We realized that including intrapreneurs in an entrepreneurship program will open up a valuable space of learning together and also from each other. While intrapreneurship teams can learn about the entrepreneurial mindset and increase their dynamic capabilities, startups benefit from their organisational know-how and deep industry knowledge. This is why, starting with March this year, we decided to offer selected intrapreneurship teams from large companies the opportunity to immerse into the typical startup environment of ELEVATE.De-risking innovationOne crucial attribute that corporates are looking for in innovation programs is risk minimization. Innovation is risky at its core, often associated with uncertainty and driven by assumptions. We help to derive facts from the underlying assumptions of a business model thorough testing and validation. This way, we take risk out of the implementation of innovation projects and allow a solid foundation for such investments.With our 4-month-program, we have found a way to support the development of new technological solutions in a resource-efficient way – and all that in an inspiring start-up environment with the help of agile processes and external know-how.First to join: Raiffeisen Bank InternationalF.l.t.r.: Maximilan Unger, Nicole Stroj (RBI), Aleksandra Petkov-Georgieva (RBI) and Katharina BinderWe are happy to have RBI on board and to support them in their journey of becoming the most innovative financial services provider on the market. Since March, RBI’s intrapreneurship team has been working alongside three tech startups, attending bootcamp sessions and working on their prototype with the hands-on support of our experts. The goal is to complete the program with a tested and marketable MVP – a new financial solution in the agricultural sector. “We are pleased to further drive our innovation efforts together with our partner TheVentury. Innovation is an essential part of our strategy and will help RBI to continuously and sustainably improve and optimize the customer experience” – Nicole Stroj, Head of Organisational Innovation at RBIRead the full press release (german only) here.Batch #7 planned in September 2021The next batch of ELEVATE will start in September 2021, with the second round now open to three corporates and six startups.

"5","https://theventury.com/blog/addressing-bias-in-ai/","TheVentury","How to address bias in AI","In my previous post “Bias in AI“, I gave and explanation of how bias can arise in AI. I aimed to give an impression that bias – particularly prejudicial bias – can only be addressed through company-wide solutions. In this blog post I want to offer some suggestions on how companies can address prejudicial biases. Types of biases To direct the discussion, I organize the types of bias into a triangle that views sources of bias from the perspective of a company. At the base are ingrained, societal biases which can influence many areas of a business. Next are the business-related practices and finally those related to machine learning. The order suggests where the most effort is needed to address bias, so I’ll follow this order going forward. In this article, I will be covering the following:Societal biasBias in business practicesBias in the development processIdentifying bias through data analyticsTech solutions Mathematical definitionsBias mitigation ToolsThe TakeawaysSocietal bias A company should not dismiss extrinsic, societal bias. Business leaders may be tempted to say “We hire fewer female developers because there are fewer female developers on the market”.While this may be true, everyone knows that it should not be this way. Institutions as well as individuals should take a responsibility to make a positive impact on society. For example, a tech firm can support their female developers in community outreach to bring tech to school age girls. I have been impressed with the outreach that I see at TheVentury. We have female developers and project leaders who engage with school age girls to show that the tech field can be a place for them. We also engage with organizations like Female Factor & Female Founders to support women who are founders or have influential roles in their companies. Supporting outreach not only helps to reduce biases, but also generates exposure for the company. Bias in business practices Existing biases can easily enter business practices unless they are given active consideration. Hiring is an obvious example of this. Certain groups may not be well represented in the employee pool. Unless a company puts effort into reaching out to such groups, they will continue to be under represented. It is important to recognize that diversity brings value to the company. Many studies have shown that having a diverse team improves performance and results. In addition to hiring, businesses should think carefully on how societal biases relate to their products or services. Project goals should be critiqued for potential biases. Questions like “Who is excluded by this product?”, “Which groups will have difficulties to access this service?”, and “How can we ensure that our product reaches a diverse audience?” can help to address biases. I don’t aim to give a complete prescription here because it depends on the business model, but consideration should be given in this manner to reduce bias. Bias in the development process Biases can be introduced at the development stage as well. The most common causes are tight development schedules and hard deadlines. When developers are under pressure to deliver, they focus on the immediate outcomes and are unable to look at the broader picture.To address this, developers should be given sufficient time to consider broader implications of projects and how bias can enter. Starting with a diverse team will also help to identify potential biases. From the project management perspective, addressing bias should be thought of in the same way as testing. It requires more resources up-front, but insures a more reliable and extensible product in the end. Identifying bias through data analyticsSince bias enters AI principally through the data, understanding the data is a key component of identifying and mitigating bias. When projects are under pressure, there may not be sufficient time to explore and understand the data. It is easy to shove data into a model, measure the performance, and move on. The real work should be to understand the data, the model, and the entire process in order to identify any issues, such as bias. Therefore, time and resources need to be dedicated these important elements of data science. Tech solutionsWhen I started researching bias in AI, my aim was to understand and expand on the tech solutions. However it became clear to me that tech solutions are just a bandage over a deeper wound. Yes, tech solutions can help you bring a better product to market, but this alone cannot address the existing biases. To really solve bias means to address it at every level as I described above. Only then should you feel confident to apply a tech solution. Mathematical definitions Biases are measured through formulas that mathematically capture our concept of bias. For example you can calculate the fraction of male or female hires with respect to the field of applicants. If they are equal or nearly equal than there is no bias. There are many ways to mathematically define bias and I could dedicate an entire blog post to the definitions, but fortunately someone already has. If you are more interested in the mathematical definitions, check out this blog post, Each measurement of bias tells you something different about the model so we normally checks against multiple formulas. It is very possible that some formulas will show bias while others will not. The data scientists along with project managers must decide if further action should be taken based on the full set of results. It is important to note that the AI cannot discover our biases for us – it knows nothing about human values. We therefore can only measure bias with respect to attributes that we have identified. This is an important weakness in relying on a tech solution. Bias mitigationIf biases are identified, there are a few possible remedies. The most obvious solution is to not use the data source or discard the model, but this is often not realistic given the needs for data and the demands of customers. Furthermore, even if other data sources are available and other models can be developed, they may have the same, or different biases. There are essentially three places where we can attempt to mitigate bias. The most direct method is to modify the data source. Since the data contain all of the information and correlations modifying the data is the most direct method. In some cases, the data may not be modifiable, perhaps because it is provided by another source. In this instance, instead of modifying the data, the model itself can be modified. Indeed the model is just a large set of weights that approximate the data. By modifying those weights, the biases can be corrected. The last method is to modify the output of the model, in the case where one has no access to the data or the model creation. This method corrects the output to remove bias, but has the least flexibility. ToolsThere are a number of enterprise tools that are available to address bias. I would like to highlight an open-source framework developed by IBM called IBM fairness 360. This framework covers the full tech solution including bias measurement using many different metrics and algorithms that apply the three types of mitigation methods. You can find some demos on their website. The framework can be used through its API, allowing anybody with some tech experience to plug in their data, measure bias, and apply mitigation methods. I will emphasize that such a tool should not be used blindly. It can help in understanding your data and models. If you use a bias mitigation method then you still need to understand what modifications were made and ensure that the performance is maintained in all aspects.At TheVentury we have already explored using fairness 360, so if you would like to evaluate and mitigate bias in your data, let us know! We can help with not only the technical aspects, but also how to address bias in the broader ways that I discussed above.The TakeawaysBias is a deeply ingrained problem that does not have simple solutions. It results from historical norms, is reflected in human behavior, and is therefore baked into the data. Indeed, as our understanding of bias has improved over time, we recognize our own biases and correct our behavior. This is unfortunately a slow process, so we need some solutions to overcome biases in data. Importantly we should also work to speed up the process by addressing bias directly. Primarily this means that time and resources need to be dedicated to understanding and addressing biases. Data scientists should have time to understand the data and to develop models that are explainable. Development and project goals should be evaluated for possible bias.Hiring a diverse team is a good step towards confronting these biases. Even overall business goals should be evaluated in the context of bias. Finally, we should all take a responsibility to address bias. Companies can contribute in one way by supporting their employees in outreach programs. This makes economic sense as well. As I pointed out in my first post on this topic, large AI projects have been abandoned because of unmanageable bias. By dedicating resources upfront, you can avoid losses due to abandoned projects.

"6","https://theventury.com/blog/anomaly-detection/","TheVentury","Machine Learning Prague 2019 – Anomaly Detection","After my first blog post “Topic Modeling” , I would also like to shed light on another extremely exciting topic: “Anomaly Detection”. which was another highlight of the “Practical conference about ML, AI & Deep Learning applications” – Machine Learning Prague 2019 , which we attended from February 22nd – 24th, 2019. I would like to briefly explain what Anomaly Detection is and then give you some examples! Here we go: Using Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection Anomaly Detection is a topic that I think is becoming more widely used. There was a very interesting presentation by Vítezslav Vít Vlcek from Broadcom called “Data-driven System health determination in Monitoring Softwares for Operational Intelligence”. The general idea is to use past data to decide if new data are conforming or anomalous.Here are a few examples where Anomaly Detection would be useful:Anomaly detection for Systems protection One common use of Anomaly Detection is to protect systems (server infrastructures, networks, etc.). This was the example on which Vítezslav based his presentation. His program uses a pattern matching algorithm inspired by the wave function collapse in Quantum Mechanics.This basically means, that his matching algorithm compares chunks of past data to new data to determine if it fits – somewhat like a puzzle. When a hacker attempts to enter the system, or it becomes unhealthy for some reason, the program detects an anomaly.The subsequent actions then depend on the needs of the customer, it could alert a systems administrator or take more drastic action such as logging out all sever users. Very useful!Anomaly detection to identify fraud Another important application of Anomaly Detection is fraud detection, which is probably used by your bank (at least I really hope it is). If you have ever received an email or call from your bank after making a strange purchase, it is probably because an AI algorithm decided that it was anomalous.Such a system collects data from purchases made through the bank and compares new purchases to the past. Such algorithms are becoming more widely used to protect people and systems from malign behavior.Predictive Maintenance applicationsWhat the presentation also made me think about is “Predictive Maintenance”. Here the algorithm records data from a machine to determine if it will break in the near future. For example, vibrations, mechanical tensions, and the sound it produces are continuously measured. The past data are used to determine if the behavior of the machine has changed and if maintenance should be undertaken.Perhaps the methods described by Vítezslav could be used for predictive maintenance as well? By intervening to fix a mechanical problem early, you can prevent costly down-times that are incurred when a part completely breaks.We are excited to keep exploring the many possibilities in this field of Machine Learning in the future! Interested in finding out more or have a chat about Machine Learning and how Anomaly Detection in particular could benefit your business?We are happy to have a talk about possible solutions that meet your needs.Let’s talk: maximilian.unger@theventury.com","March 6, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/binary-2175285_1920-1024x640-377x220.jpg"
"7","https://theventury.com/blog/behind-minds-investors/","TheVentury","In the minds of investors","The fourth post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.I got the chance to pick the brains of a few venture capitalists in Vienna to try to see their side of the picture. What do these investors see in such a vibrant emerging market?Venture Capitalists in ViennaNow that I have a better grip on the funding situation, it’s clear to me that progress is being made and that at the seed level, entrepreneurs are getting the cash injections that closely resemble those in the Bay Area.It is more than just cash, however. Investors are interested in your startup’s success, so they don’t just throw a check at you and send you on your way. They care about their money, so they do what they can to help it grow.Angels operate in the same way. As soon as they invest, they’re a part of your team and your operations. And everyone, all the big names especially, like to invest on the side: From Jeff Bezos to Zuckerberg or even Magic Johnson (seriously), their investments give the money and help that they need to break into the 10%.I sat down with a few venture capitalists based in Vienna. I wanted to see their side, to understand what they look for in a startup, and to hear their thoughts on the market here.The overriding bit that you probably could have guessed: Venture Capital in Vienna consists of almost entirely early stage investments. Confirmed!David, a managing director at Push Ventures, explained to me that he was the third member of the Push team. After the two founders started a nice fund and started gaining some traction in Vienna, they brought him in due to a lot of his insights with other European venture arms such as Gruenderfonds, a Bonn-based fund with a branch in Austria as well.He emphasized that this is, in a way, a university town—the University of Vienna does have a whopping 190,000 students—so there are clearly a lot of educated people looking to work. ViennaNaturally, students and graduates play a large role as interns and full-time workers for startups. With so many young minds in one place, they contribute a lot to the ideas that David might be considering investing in.But as David spoke about looking for “exit-oriented” teams with a leader that has it “figured out,” I wonder about how a student in his or her twenties can commit to an early stage startup looking to stay until exit.And as Push usually limits their investments to under $500,000, are they planning on holding their startups hands for five to ten (or more?) years until exit? It didn’t quite add up to me.Calmly, David explained how the smaller ventures such as theirs help in the transitional stage to bigger capital. “We never turn our backs on them… but once they get so big and have so many more investors, there will have more help than just us.”Essentially, they could be the smaller amount of money that allows a startup to create or really refine the product that they can show to the bigger funds later—it’s not an exact model, I know, but it’s a blueprint for transition at what can be the most critical stage of a startup’s existence.I left with a better understanding of that transition and the role that small capital can play. So moving forward, I had a lot of questions for both Markus, who does due diligence for Speedinvest, and Nina, a Speedinvest Principal.Markus explained that a lot of the early-stage money to be raised in Austria is about the height of what a startup can get here before they “graduate” and raise from another source.Nina concurred, explaining that “We [Speedinvest] focus all over Europe, but we mostly stay under three million with our investments.” She’s been with Speedinvest for more than 5 years, and seen first hand their fund 10x in it’s second round.While they might be looming over what Push Ventures can offer, they aren’t exactly late stage.If they’re looking around Europe and not limiting themselves, do they need to fend off other funds from taking their deals? In the overall European venture world, even Speedinvest is beaten by plenty of other firms in terms of fund size. And if Push is even smaller… does it get pretty cutthroat?Nina tells me that they’re happy to work with other funds, and David explained that if another group wants to back an interesting startup that it’s often a good sign—if you’re not the only one seeing the potential, it’s probably there, right?If you can’t beat them, join them—having a team of funders behind you can be an unbelievably huge advantage.The most important topic I wanted to discuss was people. What do they look for in a founder, an analyst, a principal?A company’s culture, to David, is much more important than their idea. He said he wanted to find those workers who were essentially willing to do whatever it took to succeed.Nina agreed, and expanded a little bit on the Speedinvest team. “We don’t take bankers,” she explained. (Did I say I’m majoring in finance? I was kidding). They want people who are relatable albeit unique, and between the two, of course, extremely driven.I asked all three of them, Daniel, Markus, and Nina, if they would prefer a bland founder with a market-changing idea or a market-changing founder with a bland idea. All three preferred the better founder. “People like that can do amazing things,” says Daniel. Clearly, it’s important to have the right culture from the beginning, because you can’t just go back and re-engineer it. In their eyes, the founder creates a culture as much as he or she does an idea.I got a lot of good insights from them. We see pretty clearly that the startup scene here is young but once again, we see that it’s growing. And if it’s being backed by the eager and excited VCs that I’ve met so far, it’ll continue that way.Does this mean that I won’t see the next unicorn being backed by Speedinvest or Push? I wondered, heartbroken.Each smiled at that, giving me the similar forms of “Perhaps one day.”","December 22, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0555_EAP_180215_TheVentury_Elevate-377x220.jpg"

However, there is a pervasive problem in AI – Bias. A biased AI may perform poorly, but beyond that, it can inherit Humans’ prejudicial biases. When an AI is perceived to make prejudicially biased decisions, users lose confidence in it and usually it is abandoned.This has happened in some of the largest tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft. This occurs despite the fact that humans may be just as biased. This is because we tend to hold AI to a higher standard than humans, as we should.AI companies and developers need to put in the time and resources to ensure that their product best serves the needs and morals of society. It is therefore time to pay attention to this problem and try to find ways to manage it.Is there a simple solution?As a tech person, I like to use technology to solve problems. There are in fact many tech solutions that aim to address bias, but in a narrow fashion. As I’ll discuss in more detail below, once you start thinking critically about bias in AI and where it comes from, you are led to consider other areas of the business. Finally, you realize that bias is everywhere and that a tech solution alone is not sufficient to solve this broader problem.Before discussing the topic further, I would like to explain what I mean by bias in more detail because it is an overloaded word. I do not mean bias in the mathematical sense, instead I mean bias in an algorithm that produces unwanted outcomes. More specifically I want to address prejudicial bias – outcomes that disadvantage certain groups of people.Sometimes this type of bias is instead referred to as fairness. Nevertheless, it is easier to say ‘bias’ than ‘lack of fairness’ so I’ll stick with ‘bias’. Dealing with prejudicial bias is difficult because it is ingrained in human nature. People and societies must consciously work to eliminate it. While progress in the right direction continues, the previous and existing bias persists in the data that we record. Computers to the rescue? Not so fast!Since bias is introduced by humans, we might hope that computers will solve our bias problems. Even though humans try to be aware of their biases, we may become less vigilant when we are tired or distracted by other problems. Computers do not get tired, hungry, or grumpy; they just rely on the algorithm and the data (watch out for memory leaks though!). However, the algorithm and in particular the data are the routes by which bias creeps in to AI. One of the starkest and most famous examples of this was the Tay bot. Tay was developed by Microsoft with the goal of learning to talk like a Twitter user by learning from twitter users. Within 24 hours of deployment though, the bot was disabled because it made racist, sexist, and generally offensive tweets after learning such language from other users. This example is quite extreme because the developers maintained no control over the training data (it had initial training before deployment, but then it learned freely). Problems with AI in HRAnother, more pertinent example can be found in Human Resources – a growing target field for AI. We also see the growth in the field through our accelerator ELEVATE, where 3 out of 5 AI-startups in our current batch are HR focused. A common desire is to automatically process CVs and choose the best candidate for the position. To learn which candidates best match, historical hiring data is used. However, in many tech firms (which are the ones trying to adopt new AI technologies) there is a historical lack of female hires. If this bias is not corrected in the data, the AI learns that male applicants are preferred over female applicants. This reportedly happened when Amazon tried to develop this kind of AI.Sources of BiasIn order to develop targeted solutions, I will start by breaking down the sources of bias and identifying how they can influence AI.1. History & SocietyIt is important to acknowledge from the beginning that prejudicial biases are deeply rooted in history and society. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that biases show up in many contexts. This does not mean that we should do nothing about them. Business and individuals alike should aim to address such biases in order to advance society as a whole. 2. Business ObjectivesConsider how prejudicial bias can enter through business objectives. While individuals or companies may not have an intentional bias, it is surprisingly easy for biases to hide behind business objectives. For example, a company wants to use sales data to direct development resources. The data analysis may lead to the company to direct its resources to high income areas. By ignoring low income areas their service will tend to disadvantage minorities, who, in some countries, tend to live-in low-income areas. This is already beginning to be a difficult conversation. From the business perspective this may be the desired outcome. Why should they develop services where they will not be profitable? From the perspective of the disadvantaged group, they have lost access to a potentially beneficial service. Moreover, the severity depends on the product and business model. On one extreme the disadvantaged group may have no interest in the service (for example, high-end designer clothing).On the other extreme a company that provides a public service such as internet access should aim to avoid this type of bias. When confronting this type of bias, a company must assess their own values and business model as well as the public response to their actions. 3. Learning BiasNow consider how existing biases can influence AI. The issue comes down to the fact that machines cannot learn on their own. Instead humans must design the algorithm and supply training data. The data reflect the realities of the possibly biased process that create it. We then give that data to a machine learning algorithm, imprinting the biases onto it. This is the case of the CV example that I mentioned above. 4. Sample BiasAI developers in particular must be aware of the ways in which biases can enter their algorithms. The developers make choices on what data to collect and reject which may lead to a bias. Sample bias can result in data that is not fully representative of the data used for prediction. For example, in order to train an image classifier to identify cats you supply it with many pictures of cats. However, if you forget to include training images of Sphynx cats (which have no fur – if you haven’t seen one google will not disappoint), your classifier will probably fail on Sphynx cats. Based on this example, sample bias may not seem to be prejudicial, but if you consider that certain groups of people may be ignored when collecting training data the link is clear. In fact there have been real cases where facial recognition algorithms were trained with faces from only a certain skin color.Not surprisingly, these fail to identify faces having skin colors that were not trained. Such a bias would have even more impact in the medical field. For example an AI could be used to identify skin melanoma. Such algorithms show promise to increase the chance of early detection, but must be trained against all skin colors so that some people are not left behind. 5. Measurement BiasAnother type of bias which is related to sample bias is measurement bias. This is essentially sample bias, but with a time component. This type of bias occurs when the data collection method or quality changes relative to the training data. For example, consider an AI that classifies images. The AI is trained with clean, high-quality images, but over time the camera gets dirty. The dirty images will likely fail the classification. Such bias can extend to prejudicial situations when using surveys, for example. If the survey questions change slightly or the survey method changes the AI that interprets the survey may acquire a bias. The takeaway is that in many conditions data taking conditions are not static and must be monitored.ConclusionTaken all together it is clear that a tech solution will not address the wider issues related to prejudicial bias. Biases are present in society and can be inherited or introduced by business practices or data science decisions. Addressing bias should involve all areas of a company from management, to data science, and developers. The upfront cost may be higher than expected, but weighted against the cost of a failed project, the additional cost is worth it. In my next blog post I will lay out a broad program – or at least some suggestions – for how to handle bias and ensure fairness when it comes to AI.

Or what Growth Hackers do differently from digital marketers?You are not alone!But don’t worry. In around 2 minutes you will be released of the unknowing.Firstly, both types make sense in different scenarios as you will find out – however, Growth Hacking abilities will be more practical and necessary in the next few years, should the world keep changing as quickly. Don’t believe me? Read for yourself:Let’s start with the difference between Growth Hackers and digital marketers.How Growth Hackers differ from digital marketers:Data drivenTech-savvyT-shaped: knows all channels, but has dominant skillsEager to learn and CreativeTesting all the timeThey only take action based on data-proven results.What digital marketers exactly are:Specialists in one or two channelsTradition in finding marketing solutionsEconomic or Sales backgroundPlanning long term/whole campaignsThe bottom line is: while digital marketers follow a long-term path and develop entire campaigns, Growth Hackers take baby steps to achieve one and one thing only – growth. Now that we already have an idea about the main differences between Growth Hacking and digital marketing, let’s dive deeper.What is Growth Hacking?If you might think it all comes down to one awesome idea and bam: Instant growth – You are wrong. Sorry! Growth Hacking is a never-ending process. A process that must be measurable, testable and scalable.During this process the Growth Hackers takes baby steps to be flexible and quick. For example: If you build a start-up from scratch, you don’t have the time nor the money to create long-term campaigns. Growth Hacking allows you to test whether your hypotheses are right and what helps you with growing your business quickly and with little money. What is digital marketing?Let’s start with the biggest advantage and difference to Growth Hacking – Branding.Digital marketing is still the best way to brand your business and build awareness.While Growth Hacking is fast and concentrates on single tactics, digital marketing keeps brand awareness and its necessary strategies in mind.The job of a digital marketing manager is to acquire more users/customers by maintaining the brand reputation. SEO, Social Media, Pay-per-Click and Content Marketing are the main campaign types digital marketers use to achieve that. Digital marketers are more focused on branding, storytelling, long-term thinking, and emotions.The 3 Main Differences between Growth Hacking and digital marketing:Growth Hackers and digital marketers may use the same channels and have similar personal traits, but their ideologies are very different.Focus on the FunnelWhile digital marketers only focus on Acquisition and Activation of users, a Growth Hacker will always think about the whole sales/product funnel. They invent strategies and tactics to convert a potential customer on the whole user journey.Aquisition: acquire new and many customersActivation: make customers use your product or serviceRetention: make customers come back or re-visitReferral: make customers tell their friendsRenvue: Earn real moneyTechnical BackgroundDigital marketers are usually non-technical people, which leads to them often relying on developers, designers, and data scientists to implement their ideas. Growth Hackers, on the other hand, are tech-savvy and can execute their ideas on their own.However, that also means that Growth Hacking is not an inherent gift. Digital marketers can still become Growth Hackers if they have a strong analytical and technical mind.ProcessesAs explained above, the two types of marketers pursue the user funnel differently. Digital marketers are simply generating leads. In other words, they make people want the product.Growth Hackers work together closely with developers and define the product based on data. In plain English, they produce a product people want. ConclusionEvery Marketer can become a Growth Hacker or transform their current tactics into Growth Hacking processes. You don’t need to fulfil all requirements at once – baby steps are the first steps towards becoming a Growth Hacker.

Whether that endeavor is improving a serve in tennis or increasing sales in an online store, tailored and specific feedback is essential. This is just as important when refining chatbots.Which is why we put focus on analytics for bots in our accelerator program. At our last meetup for ELEVATE, keynote speakers Klemens Zleptnig, Toni.ai and Tuba Tezer, botanalytics discussed how to use analytics tools for bots and what metrics to track to optimize chatbots.Klemens recommends using Google Analytics. Not only is GA free, but it also has a great user interface and extra features. Although it wasn’t designed for chatbots, there are easy workarounds that make using GA a viable option. But there are many more bot analytic services you can look into:Bot KPI’sWhile using analytics tools, there are several key performance indicators (KPIs) chatbot developers should think about:average session lengthnumber of messages not handled by a botmost active hourstotal number of messages sent/receivedresponse timeretention ratedaily new usersThese are all valuable statistics for chatbot developers seeking to optimize their product.However, it is apparent that there is not a perfect combination of KPIs for every chatbot. For instance, if a chatbot oriented towards companionship has a higher number of total messages sent per conversation, it is a positive indicator. In a different category such as customer service, however, that could be a negative.For example, using the case study of a pizza-ordering bot, the most active hours are one of the most important KPIs. Before sports games and in the evening are the most active hours for pizza orders. So chatbot developers can use this information to re-engage their users through push notifications or reminders.The primary takeaway? It is crucial to view analytics as an integral part of bot development. This involves identifying which KPIs are most important to your business model and developing the bot in accordance with that data.Get ready to tap into the potential of analytics and the opportunities it can open up for your bot business!Interested in more details or have any questions?

"12","https://theventury.com/blog/botbase-chatbot-framework/","TheVentury","The BotBase – The Enterprise-Ready Chatbot Framework","Please go to www.botbase.tech for updated information about our latest venture BotBase!Hello, BotBase!TheVentury is proud to tell about our experience in developing bots by releasing the very first blog article about our proprietary Chatbot Framework, the BotBase. Through an intense journey working with start-ups and established companies for almost two years, the development team of TheVentury discovered particular requirements that start-ups and corporates have a like.The lowest common denominator of the start-up and corporate ecosystem determine the functionalities and application programming interfaces that our very own BotBase provides.Over the last second years we developed the BOTBASE towards an interface agnostic platform that provides the opportunity to operate with a multi-platform approach that ensures a consistent user experience across channels like:Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Web Interface for your website,Whatsapp, Slack, SMS, E-Mail, Skype & Skype for Business,Voice Interfaces like amazon ALEXA. The Chatbot Framework: Technical PerspectiveFrom a technical perspective the chatbot framework is written in node.js, a programming language that is based on JavaScript. This server-sided software development platform enables the BOTBASE to create a fully-horizontal scalable and resource-efficient architecture that corporates and start-up teams require both alike.Since the BOTBASE is delivered as a dockerized application the advantages for server administrators and developers are obvious:Rapid application deployment due to minimal runtime requirements that reduces size and allows to be deployed quickly. Portability across machines since the application and all its dependencies can be bundled into a single container that is independent from often upcoming compatibility issues. Version control and component reuse by tracking successive versions and easy roll-back to previous options. Minimal overhead & simplified maintenance due to non-existing application dependencies. By deploying the DOCKER container on-premise TheVentury ensures to be GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant in terms of data-storage and data-processing. Since the requirements towards non-cloud technologies are mandatory, especially for sensitive data sets, the BOTBASE provides strong support for on-premise deployment and works seamlessly across on-premise infrastructure.As we know from talks to various corporate innovation leaders that triggering custom events such as Cronjobs and a full ENTERPRISE LOGGING are requirements that need to be part of the package to fulfill policy requirements and a seamless integration to the existing architecture and business processes.The requirements of clients from very different industry verticals led us to the decision to built our BOTBASE platform agnostic in terms of NLP (natural language processing), ANALYTICS and CRM (Customer-Relationship-Management) / ERP (Enterprise-Ressource-Management) integrations. Why is that?Because we believe that different solutions provide different strengths that can, if used and orchestrated right, be leveraged to provide our clients with the best possible solution available on the market for the demanded use-case.By integrating connectors for different Natural Language Processing / Understanding solutions such as the IBM Watson Platform, Googles NLP Solution, or our Partners such as RASA (Open-Source-Software) and DeepSearch, our clients are able to cherry-pick their preferred solution.Microsoft Azure Bot & Cognitive Services enables us through the BOTBASE to Microsoft Bot Framework integration to give our clients the opportunity to make use of their Microsoft Suite and deploy Bots for Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business with direct connection to Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and other applications without losing the flexibility that is necessary to be ready for the challenges that they might face in the future.The modular architecture of the BOTBASE makes us as flexible as our clients demand us to be. Our mantra: Always stay agile!We know how difficult it is to be flexible within a corporate legacy system. <U+0001F609>Thinking of building a bot for your project?Let’s talk: maximilian.unger@theventury.com","February 6, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sharon-mccutcheon-532782-unsplash-377x220.jpg"
"13","https://theventury.com/blog/ceos-at-riseconf/","TheVentury","What the CEO of Tinder, Air Asia & Giphy had to say at RISE!","RISE – the largest tech conference in Asia!3 days, 3 nights, 16,000 attendees & 350 speakers!Where? In Hong Kong – where East meets West! Truly.When we attended RISE from July 8th – 11th, we did not only introduce our latest venture BotBase but also got a chance to listen to some highly influential speakers, founders, CEOs! I would now like to share some interesting insights with you!Tinder CEO – Elie SeidmanLaunching “Lite”Some months back the dating app announced its plans to expand to the Asian market. At RISE the CEO mentioned, that the next expansion was going to be in Vietnam with “Tinder Lite”. This version of the app would have almost the same features but would use less battery and data (up to 20% less than the full version). However, in order to ensure that the app works with slow internet networks, it will have to remove the “Tinder Feed”.Elie Seidman, Tinder CEO at RISE 2019A similar announcement was made by the Spotify Global Head of Markets, Cecilia Qvist, who spoke about launching Spotify Lite in Asia and also spoke about the successful expansion to India, where they were able to acquire 1 Million users within the first week of launch.The two are following the footsteps of Facebook, who launched Facebook Lite in 2015. Great examples of companies not only customizing their products in terms of content adaption to local needs but also thinking about solving issues that prevent users from having a good user experience.Now let’s talk about the real reason why you came to read this blog post. Secret tips about getting more matches by the CEO of the most popular dating app himself, right? No, of course not. We know that’s not why you are here, but just in case you were wondering, here you go:Increasing your chances to get matchedThe CEO of Tinder was asked to share the big secret. How can users increase their chances to get matched? Spoiler: it’s not really a big surprise and hardly a secret.He said that from looking at the data, it is very clear to see that people talking about their passion in the bio field have a higher success rate than users who simply upload a head-shot image. There you go. He confirmed something that has been a long-time rumor. Uploading a picture alone apparently is not enough.He also mentioned how “the desire to create a human connection is not a new idea” when he was questioned what intentions he had while founding the company.Besides launching the Lite version of Tinder, GDPR has also been on Tinder’s agenda in the past months. “We choose to comply with GDPR globally”, he explained. They have aligned users in protecting their data while helping them find online connections. It seems that GDPR compliance is becoming a feature rather than it just being about privacy.AirAsia CEO – Tony FernandesThe Malaysian low-cost airline is headquartered near Kuala Lumpur and is the largest airline in Malaysia by destinations. What makes the company as successful as it is? The CEO Tony Fernandes shared his secret to success at RISE with the audience and wow, he is one of the best story-tellers I have ever come across.PeoplePeople are at the core of innovation and success, Fernandes explained. He shared that keeping an open door and ensuring the development of his staff is what enabled AirAsia to reach the height of success that it has. Caring for the staff is critical and not something you do because it’s “nice”. My personal highlight – him mentioning how you have to look worse than your employees in order to be approachable. By that he meant “dressing down” rather than showing up to work in a suit and tie every single day. Tony Fernandes, AirAsia CEO at RISE 2019Simplified BrandingWhat played an important role for AirAsia was also the evolution of its brand identity, Fernandes explained. “Coca Cola only has one logo, so does Shell or Apply” – then why invest in multiple images or logos? Keep it simple. He simplified the branding and created a strong identity by sticking to one color and one logo only.Giphy CEO – Alex ChungAnother really great speaker, Alex Chung, CEO & Founder of Giphy. If you are ever at a conference where you see his name on the Agenda – make sure to attend!In a round-table session, that he was leading he was asked about his secret to success. His answer: “I worked on 200 different ideas, this one worked out and took 5-6 years to become successful”.Well, that was a very honest take, people thought, who were hoping to hear something more magical. I guess the magic lies in the product and the ability to integrate it on different platforms. Starting from Facebook, Whatsapp to Zendesk. Alex Chung explained how messages that include gifs have an 80% higher response rate than text-only messages. Everyone talks about the growth of video, gifs are part of the same medium.Alex Chung, Giphy CEO at RISE 2019GlocalizationWhen asked about whether users would use “local” gifs more, Chung explained that emotion-based gifs would work equally well if they weren’t local but when looking into action-based gifs, local content would work better.Here are some fun-facts:There are differences in the use of gifs in the morning. In India for example, there is a huge spike for “morning gifs”, since Indians tend to send each other “good morning” messages on a daily basis.In the United States, the coffee gifs are most popular in the mornings.In Korea, people don’t send gifs in mornings at all.To sum it up3 very different companies, 3 very different CEOs. What they all had in common? Their focus on creating better user experiences, strong brand identities and thinking globally by adapting to he Asian market needs.More blogs from our Asia trip:Also have a look at what the which Tech Trends were discussed by Uber & Googleand what we learning about Innovation in Hong Kong & China.

Well because if you think about it (and its size), it almost feels ignorant to not be interested in a huge market with a lot of potential. We decided to pitch BotBase at RISE and use the two weeks we are there to explore Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai.What we learnt on our first few days there already: there is a LOT that is going on there. We got to see and understand many cool things happening in the innovation & start-up space. What exactly did we find particularly interesting there? Well, we have put together our key learnings, experiences of our trip and the most impressive facts for you.<U+7CA4><U+6E2F><U+6FB3><U+5927><U+6E7E><U+533A>Greater Bay Area – Market power & sustainabilityLet’s begin with the famous “Greater Bay Area”.Bay Area sounds familiar, right? But why “Greater”?In 2017, during the 13th five-year plan for economic and social development, China announced to form a megapolis that consists of 9 cities and 2 special administrative areas, kind of a megacity in the already most dense region of the world.The goal: to foster economic potential condensed in an area with combined 70 million people, nearly 5 percent of the overall mainland china population that occupies less than 1 percent of china’s land area but contributes 12 percent of GDP.This really Is GREAT, right?9/9/6The government of mainland china takes innovation seriously. Politically, as well as economically a basis to foster entrepreneurship in all different kinds of areas Is truly provided.Moreover, the entrepreneurial zeal of the Greater Bay Area is hard to compare with other hubs in the world. Even if you hustle hard!Ever heard of 9/9/6?China always had the reputation of putting work before life.9/9/6 at a Chinese company means that the workday starts at 9am, finishes at 9pm, with an extended 6-day week.One of the expat founders from the United States who we met in China simply described the ‘brutal truth’: “My engineering team works hard. There are some of the brightest minds in our industry and they grind daily. You still can’t compare it to a start-up driven by the Chinese 9/9/6 culture. If you work hard, they will work harder. It’s pure competition.”<U+9999><U+6E2F>Hong Kong – one country, two systemsWe spent most of our time in Hong Kong and truly fell in love with the high energy of the place. What we heard almost every day during our time there was people referring to their constitutional principle “one country, two systems“. Within the People’s Republic of China, socialism is maintained, while Hong Kong can retain the capitalist system after peaceful unification.If you look at the start-up ecosystem and take a closer look at the corporate innovation projects of established companies in Hong Kong, this difference to China becomes very clear.Many projects revolve around Blockchain, Fintech and other fields that require much more liberal conditions which are available in Hong Kong, more than in other parts of the world. Not without good reason, Hong Kong has been ranked number one among the economically most liberal cities in the world for several years.Starting a business there Is very easy and only costs ONE obligatory Hong Kong dollar. Yes, we completely understand If you are now considering opening an office In Hong Kong. We were constantly playing with the same thought. They make managed to make It very tempting for entrepreneurs.This is probably also the reason for the booming start-up ecosystem in Hong Kong. Last year alone +150% more startups settled in Hong Kong, over the last 5 years 300% more jobs were created in startup related companies. <U+6DF1><U+5733>Shenzhen – A full end to end ecosystemNow let’s look at one of the most interesting cities I have ever been to. Seriously!Back in the 70s Shenzhen was a tiny fishing village with a population of around 30.000.Around 10 years later Shenzhen became China’s first special economic zone, which made Shenzhen grow on an astounding rate year per year. Latest estimates count about 12,500,000 people living in the urban area of Shenzhen.Basically, Shenzhen became the number one hub for serving the world with electronic consumer goods, the biggest hub for hardware startups and the gadget factory of the world.Although there is good reason to skeptically question the development of Shenzhen, the growth miracle “made in China” produces the highest per capita income in whole China, lifted (together with the whole economic development of China) around 800 million people out of poverty.But Shenzhen is not only about economic growth!Maker Spaces in ShenzhenMakerspace “Troublemaker” in ShenzhenThe advantage for start-ups from all over the world that drives them to Shenzhen becomes clear when talking to entrepreneurs in one of the in the city located Maker Spaces.A hardware entrepreneur (start-up still in stealth mode) from California told us: “Compared to the US, we can make our products four times as fast with a tenth of the costs. The time of the ‘copycat stereotype’ approach is over – the Chinese ecosystem understands quality more and more as an advantage and focuses on increasing in this area.”Learn more about Shenzhen in a nutshell here:SummaryIn retrospect, our trip to Hong Kong and China was very educational and really widened my horizon. We were able to bring back a very different mind-set of some highly inspiring people we met there and are looking forward to maintaining the relationships we built there.In numerous conversations it became clear to me that China, also due to the strong influence of the government in economic topics, pursues a clear focus with a lot of power: Interdisciplinary collaboration and a stable infrastructure provide the basis for rapid growth, sustainable development and a perspective that may leave the West far behind.China is creating a new sense of community on the road to an affluent society. ‘Don’t give a hungry man a fish, Give him your fishing rod.’More blogs from our Asia trip:Also have a look at the insights the CEOs of Tinder, Giphy & AirAsia gave at RISE and which Tech Trends were discussed by Uber & Google!","July 23, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1512446387219-99c19f8fe95f-377x250.jpeg"

But when’s the right time to join one? And which one is the right one for you?Running ELEVATE, our accelerator for early-stage AI startups and for almost 4 years now, we have read through hundreds of applications and interviewed almost as many startups. Running a community of different accelerators, we know how diverse accelerators can be and how hard it is to pick the right one for your startups. So today, we want to give you some pointers on what to pay attention to when picking your accelerator. Let’s get into it.The stageThere are definitely differences in the stages accelerators focus on. From problem-solution fit, to investment-readiness, to partnering up with corporates on concrete projects, different accelerators have different target stages.So before applying for an accelerator think about the stage you are in, your goals for the next year and the steps you need to be taking to get there. Does the accelerator fit these goals and next steps? Will it help you get there? If you are not sure, reach out to the accelerator team and ask. This is also a great way to learn more about how they interact with their potential participants.The focusPick any topic that comes to your mind and I am pretty sure there is an accelerator for it out there. Specific industries, problems they are focusing on solving, technologies, you name it. Pick a focus that’s important for your startups’ future and growth. Whatever the focus is, you’ll meet lots of other people from the same area there. Startups working in the same field or on the same technologies, experts & potential clients from that area, so pick it wisely.The offerThere are different accelerator models out there – some invest money or working time, some offer advice and workshops, some take equity, some don’t. Again, think about what you need at your stage. Money is usually the shiny thing that attracts startups first, but make sure to look beyond the surface. Is money really the thing you need most at your stage? Maybe the access to a network of investors and/or potential clients is more important at your point? Other accelerators invest in hands-on services, helping you build and grow your product.Check them all closely and ask yourself if the value you get out of it is worth it to you.The peoplePay attention to the interactions you have with the accelerator. Be it answers to your first emails or later on in your interviews. Are they asking you interesting questions? Are they genuinely interested in what you are doing? Are they adding value in this phase already, maybe challenging you, maybe giving you advice?Depending on the accelerator, these people might be invested in your startup in the long run. So make sure you would be happy having them on board for longer than the duration of the program.A great way to learn more about the people but also the overall value of the program is to talk to alumni. Just ask the accelerator team for a connection to some alumni. In most cases, this won’t be a problem and will give you another chance to observe how they interact with their alumni.ELEVATE Just in case you were wondering about how our accelerator works…For ELEVATE, we focus on early-stage startups working on AI solutions. Given the stage our startups are in, we are specifically looking at the team and the progress they have made so far. What we are specifically and most importantly asking ourselves in the interviewing phase are the following things:Can we add value for this team at their stage, with their specific needs and their set-up?How is the team dynamic within the team? Do we think this team is flexible enough to work with curve balls? Would we like to work with this team on a personal level?When have they started and what have they achieved so far? What are their biggest learnings from the early stage and how have they adapted to it?You can find out more here: elevate.theventury.comWe hope this short article will help you to pick the right accelerator for your startup. Let us know what you think in the comments and don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any further questions.","December 22, 2020","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Batch-6-377x250.png"

Like, annoyingly hard.The odds are stacked against students who don’t have enough preparation or information on how to prepare.This is the gap that David Coates tries to fill with Chooter. His A.I.-driven tutoring tool provides individually fitted classes based on your target university and personal knowledge.In his post-month-1 interview he told us about the biggest learning he had as well as his F***-Up.50% off on MarketingThe learning that astonished the CEO of Chooter the most, is the fact that marketing does not have to be expensive. Naturally, thinking about marketing, stuff like Google Ads and Facebook will come to mind. But virality isn’t bound to the amount of money spent!Are ads really the best way to reach your audience? Chooter’s target audience are students, a group that is already actively discussing the problems that David solves – So it makes sense to be active on these Social Media pages – To take part in the discussion and finding potential leads. Cost = 0€Think about what’s most effective, not what has the most splash in your bank account Underestimating existing business contactsThe main mistake David talked about occurred during the validation phase: Obviously validation requires doing extensive market research as well as approaching possible users and competitors to receive feedback.Now – being keen on doing all that – David forgot a rather simple thing: There’s usually already people that did the legwork! There will be people that operate in the same field and may be willing to share some valuable information.So be sure to check with other companies that might already have gained insight in the topic – You might save time and money.The problem with remote staffDavid is working together with various students from all over the country: Young and talented people that are keen on helping with the project. The problem: They are scattered all over the country!Now, meeting everybody in person would have required much time – time that David did not have. So he skipped on meeting his employees and experienced the #1 problem of working remote: The staff will quickly feel disconnected from the project rather than feeling fully involved. That’s why he can only emphasize: Keep the people close and take the time to get to know them in person!Month 1 – The verdictDavid states he learned a lot in the first month and underlines the importance of staying open minded. Especially in the validation phase he learned to be confident in his product, but never being afraid of being wrong. In perfect ELEVATE-fashion he ended the interview with a great tip for future participants:Build – Measure – Learn and you will fit in perfectly with the ELEVATE team","November 30, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lean-startup-summit-2-377x220.jpg"
"17","https://theventury.com/blog/company-culture/","TheVentury","What I learnt about TheVentury in my 8 weeks!","Hi, I’m Sam from MinnesotaEvery intern feels the same way for their first day on the job.Anxiety.A bit of fear.And a lot of excitement.You don’t know what the job will entail or how the employees will accept you. Which can be stressful. Eight weeks ago, this was me.Coming from the U.S., I wasn’t sure how I would fit in, or if I would fit in at all. However, after over a month at TheVentury, I can confidently say that all the worrying was for no reason.TheVentury is just different, they’re unique. Spend an hour as a fly on the wall here and you’ll see how they’re family. And in this family, everyone genuinely enjoys what they do, and they enjoy working here. As an intern, I’ve noticed quickly that there are endless reasons why people love to work at TheVentury.There are endless reasons why I love it too. However, since I don’t have endless space… I’ll just give you my top three (in no particular order).The WorkloadMy actual work desk, this picture was taken while writing this.I can still recall my interview with TheVentury right now.When asked what I wanted out of an internship, my response was that I wanted to contribute. I wanted to do work that would benefit the company, as well as aid my learning and growth as an inspiring marketer.TheVentury has given me that opportunity and more.Back in the U.S., I know plenty of interns whose day is comprised of filing paper and fetching coffee (Adam, if you’re reading this I apologize). That is not something you’ll get working here at TheVentury. In my short time here, I’ve done work that has made me proud and feel accomplished. I have done work that has helped me develop and learn. Do you know that type of work that when you finish, you have to sit back and admire it? Yeah? That’s the work I’ve been given the responsibility to accomplish.InclusionBe E.P.I.CE- Entrepreneurial ThinkingP- PassionateI- ImpactC-Cooperative and EmpoweringHere are TheVentury’s core values. To be EPIC.However, if it were up to me, TheVentury’s core values would be “to be E.P.I.C.I”. With the additional I – and that stands for Inclusive. As the youngest and lowest ranking person in this office, you’d assume I would be looked over and disregarded. That is not the case whatsoever.Here, I am treated like a friend, and as an equal. The people that makeup TheVentury view me as part of the team, and that is a special feeling, especially in the workplace.For example, during daily team stand-up meetings, developers like Jakob Reiter and Tatyana Sandanova truly seem interested in the work I’m doing. Just as interested as I am in what they’re doing- and they’re doing some really cool stuff! The fact that I’m given a part in these standup meetings is really meaningful for an intern. I am included and viewed as an equal, and that is very motivating.Company CultureIn sports, the teams with the best locker-room culture, tend to be successful. These teams are organized like a well-run business and succeed because of it. In the NBA, the San Antonio Spurs are a prime example of this. Their culture is why they have been the most successful basketball organization for the past decade.The Spurs have:Excellent leadershipIncredible teamworkMost importantly, strong relationshipsThese features define the Spurs culture, and they win because of it.TheVentury is like the Spurs.From my four weeks here, I have noticed plenty of comparisons between these two businesses’ and their work environments. Culture is really about the people within the office, and the relationships they foster.It doesn’t take long for you to realize the people in this office are extraordinary, and the relationships they have with one another are truly genuine.These friendships allow for great teamwork on any project, and the freedom for an individual to step up and become a leader. This level of trust and cohesion between colleagues is a clear indicator that the culture here is second to none.ConclusionI’ve come a long way since my first day on the job. That anxiety and fear I mentioned earlier has been entirely erased. Since that first day, I’ve been completely embraced by everyone at this company, and as a 21-year-old intern, I cannot appreciate that enough.In my first few weeks, I’ve learned a lot as well. Everything from marketing tactics to company culture has helped me develop and understand the world of business more. Which I believe should be the goal for every intern.I’ll leave you with a picture of the Saubär (the bear who reminds us to keep the office clean) Enjoy!","July 1, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1449449-377x220.jpg"

Easy peasy. Before logging out you go back to your Shoe Paradise shopping cart to see whether the order has been processed correctly. Prize – Correct. Address – Check. Product image – What? Why did the colour suddenly switch to gold? The order has been placed and is up for delivery. Online shopping is super easy, but what on earth will you do with golden shoes?What do you do now?You try to call the customer service. But after queuing for 10 minutes and paying 0,30€ for each – listening to the same sequence of classical music over and over again – you are close to giving up. Suddenly, service agent Melanie responds with a friendly voice and you explain your problem. Then she reconnects you to another department because she couldn’t help.You explain everything again – this time to Bernhard. He´s not too friendly – must have had a tough day. He connects you to Petra.Petra explains: They are having issues with the e-Commerce platform and are trying to fix it. She asks you to send a message to the complaint inbox – the tech team will take over.You reach out through another channel: the complaint inbox. Again, you briefly explain what happened and ask for a colour change back to blue. Answer pending.Nowadays, we have chatbots which can solve your golden shoe problem in a time span no longer than having a coffee. Just have a look:Customer service bots read or listen to your messages, connect the information to your customer profile and immediately understand the issue. Your order, your problem and needs – You say it, it’s done. No matter the channel you use to reach out to Shoe Paradise, the multi-messenger platform connects the dots. Never tell your story multiple times repeatedly, just lean back and let the bot work its magic. Does the bot not know the answer yet, the question is forwarded to a customer service agent.What modern data-lovers enjoy most about this?First of all, on TheVentury’s botbase framework your data is safe and cannot be seen or used by any third parties. We´re fully GDPR-compliant.Secondly, the human part of the customer service chain can trace back all requests and information that was already transmitted in a chat. This seamless customer service experience heavily increases happiness – for customers and employees alike. Service employees are still highly important, their work just got more efficient and enjoyable.Thirdly, the bots improve their service quality on a daily basis and learn from every issue. This will make your shopping experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible. What a time to be alive. Dreaming of bots?

On September 8th we opened our doors to invite a selected crowd of VCs and business angels to the Arcotel Donauzentrum. The new tech hotel of the Arcotel group was the perfect match for a Chatbot Demo Day.Investors Master ClassThe day kicked off with an exiting keynote from Kaj Hagros – seed investor and CEO at Pivot5. Kaj founded 8 companies, served 30 boards and had several successful exits. He flew in from Helsinki to talk about his angel experiences and chatbot investments in Finland. As investor, the most important investment criteria for him is:He argued that many teams are so excited about their concept, that they fail to see the importance of a smart go-to-market strategy. Also, he pointed out, investors should only invest in domains that they fully understand.‘There used to be an app for everything. Now there is a bot for everything.’Kaj talked about the many use cases for chatbots: from equity research to AI-based health assistance. However, he highly emphasised that a bot itself, is not the business itself – it is a way of reaching and engaging with your target audience.The potential of chatbotsThe keynote was followed by a panel discussion by:Kaj Hagros – CEO at Pivot5Wolfgang Bosch – Business Development Executive at IBM WatsonNatalie Korotaeva – Facebook Developer Circle Vienna LeadMarc Isop – Chief Revenue Officer at Onlim The discussion gave interesting insights into the potential of bots in the corporate and startup environment. Furthermore, the panellists discussed the role of women in the chatbot community and whether the majority of bot personalities is male or female. All speakers agreed that there are many use cases for bots, but that ‘building a bot company’ should not be the ultimate business goal – a chatbot makes sense if it is the best way to reach the consumer.Pitch your botAfter a short coffee and networking break, it was finally time for our teams to step on stage. Our 4 chatbot companies had to face a though jury:Selma Prodanovic – founder and CEO of 1MillionStartupsNina Wöss – Principal at SpeedinvestKaj Hagros – CEO at Pivot5The jury had some tough but fair questions for the teams, and pointed out that all pitches were extremely well done and interesting. After the last pitch, the vistors and people watching the livestream were asked to vote for their favorite pitch. Team Jingle collected the most votes and therefore received a hotel voucher from Arcotel Donauzentrum.After that, the official part of the Demo Day was over. Food and drinks were served and TheVentury invited everyone to a fun afterparty in the first district.We think that the demo day was a huge success. We received amazing feedback from visitors, our jury and the teams. We are extremely happy to release 4 market-ready bots to the world and we are keen to see them live their full potential! We will further support them and their way and will integrate them in the Elevate Alumni Group – they will always be important members of the ELEVATE family!You couldn’t make it to the Demo Day?

So Kathy, what exactly is Design Thinking? Design Thinking is the I- düpfele on top of innovationWhat our Swabian colleague is trying to convey is that design thinking is the icing on top of a delicious problem-solving cake. Now, as that still might not explain everything, let’s start with a better metaphor.6 blind servants and an elephantOnce upon a time there was a king living in a far away land. He had heard of legendary creatures roaming the lands of Africa and wanted to know what they looked like. So he sent 6 of his most loyal servants on an expedition to come back with an accurate description of an elephant. The catch: All of them were blind. Then what did they tell him once they returned?“Elephants are equipped with giant ears!” said the one, that had been assigned to feel up the elephant’s head.“No, they are just a tale with hair at the end.” explained the one that had angered the animal by pulling its tail.“On the contrary!” the third one exclaimed “They are just one big fat mass!”“You are all absolutely right. That is an elephant.” the king calmed down his servants.So, what’s the lesson?It is all about perspectiveWould only one of the servants alone have gotten the right picture? Absolutely not. They were all approaching their task, their problem, from a different perspective and just by combining each individual solution managed to fulfil what they were sent to do. That is the premise of Design Thinking. You can never perfectly solve an (innovation) problem without some extra insights. Or by changing your point of view and taking your users’ position. Here’s what you do: You will first explore the problem from your users’ perspective, assume their POV and then get to work. This is called the “Double Diamond”: We’ll broaden your spectrum, then narrow it down and focus. Then we will broaden your mindset with excessive brainstorming, then you test it.DISCOVERFind out what your audience’s problems and pain points are. Conduct interviews, send out surveys, ask for feedback. Just listen to them! You can only solve problems you are aware of – And you only have to solve problems that actually exist.EMPATHIZEGain a deep understanding of why this is a problem. What exactly are your users’ expectations? What do they want? Try to understand what pains your users. Really understand and feel with them. This will make you thrive for a solution.DEFINECombine your empathic feelings and compelling motivations with rational thinking and scope a specific challenge. This often requires reframing your previous thoughts and looking at them through a more objective lens – But it will enable you to finally get to work.IDEATEBrainstorm. Mentally go wide and document everything that comes to mind – as crazy as it might seem. That’s the goal: Think outside the box, drop the focus and go wild on your mind maps. You may or may not catch a gem.PROTOTYPETime to get your hands dirty, figuratively or literally. Bring your idea into the physical world, be it with post-it notes, Lego, forming it with clay or doing an interpretive dance. Discuss. If you forgot – This is a team activity. Resolve discussion, start a conversation, get rid of bad ideas quickly.TESTFeedback- time! Talk to other people, be it your users, other problem-solvers, your boss or your mom. Is there anything you overlooked when building your prototype? Anything missing? This phase helps you with refining your point of view and gathering more information. But most importantly it stays true to our mantra:BUILD – MEASURE – LEARN Interested in learning more about Design Thinking and its possibilities?Contact us and we will get in touch!

In our interview they talked about the first month, the struggles of validation and how they wanted to make their website stand out.As a reminder: The first month was all about validation – Building an MVP and approaching customers to receive feedback. That is usually already the first point of traction: People usually don’t enjoy receiving phone calls to answer questions.Yet, David and Mike pulled through and talked with clients and potential clients about various topics:What are their needs? What pained them when searching for coders? What did they think went well in the cooperation? What did not work out?This is all important information to put into validation in order to create a suiting product.

Which means there is more work waiting for Valentin Aschermann. He is first in line to explain the accelerator’s advantages, the risks of starting a business and how to handle them through validation & experimentation. So, Valentin – how do you feel about this Batch?“Batch #3 of ELEVATE is looking Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!”Now, this might seem like a pretty audacious statement but coming from a man that knows the Startup-industry like he does, it might even be an understatement.After founding his own startup SIMPLEWISH following his graduation in 2012, Valentin decided to move on and became a startup consultant and program manager at INiTS, Vienna’s high-tech incubator. He worked with around 50 startups and helped them grow from an idea to a fully validated business model – experience he now implements as head of Startup Services at TheVentury: He is involved in all offers towards Startups as well as in ELEVATE.ELEVATE is an accelerator program that in a first step helps startups with systematically testing out their most crucial hypotheses through qualitative and quantitive experiments & validation. Then, once problem-solution fit is found, it’s time for execution: We provide startups with a senior developer as well as a growth hacker and they are ready to start accelerating their development. That’s what makes ELEVATE special – it provides the resources startups are so desperately looking for.Hypothesis-testing as a solution to de-risking failureFollowing their very definition, Startups are exposed to a lot of risk based on uncertainty, the liabilities of newness and smallness – but most importantly the founders’ bias. Valentin proposes hypothesis-driven validation as solution to the problem – Translating founders’ visions into critical assumptions and testing them through experiments. In this process founders continuously de-risk and learn, helping them with preventing problems in the long run.“I wanted to ingrain a feeling for the importance of this data-driven approach.”, Valentin says. “We went through a fuck-up story so founders would realize how an invalid hypothesis and the wrong approach can cause failure.” Planning isn’t the answer to high uncertainty – Learning is.So what tip can you give founders, Valentin?To quote Steve Blank: There are no facts inside the building so get the heck outside. – There is no value in theoretically approaching a topic without any knowledge, so get out there and don’t forget to stick to the “Lean”-approach: Build – Measure – Learn!

Telling a story is not about explaining, it is about getting your audience curious to learn more and go the next step with you. You will never be able to explain anything sufficiently in a pitch.Let me tell you a story: Once upon a time there was a group of ambitious, hardworking entrepreneurs. They had a great idea and provided an invaluable service – yet they did not have any success when pitching their idea. They tried to convince people, they explained their vision – Nothing seemed to help.Until Michael Buchecker came around – and explained them good storytelling.The power of storytellingSee what I did there? This blog could have started out the old-fashioned way, but that wouldn’t really have caught your interest – would it? That’s what we learned in Michael’s ELEVATE workshop – how to build your story and get others excited about your idea.His #1 tip to share with a founder:Don’t explain. Never. Storytelling is not about explaining, it is about getting your audience curious to learn more and go the next step with you. You will never be able to explain anything sufficiently in a pitch.Why does that matter?“Simple – you can have the best idea in the world, if you can’t get others excited about it, you will sell yourself short.” Well-prepared communication is sadly often underestimated: There is a lot of examples of ideas and products that failed due to ineffective communication.Over the years Michael Buchecker has worked with around 250 startups – most of them from high tech areas that provide products that are hard to explain. In workshops and coaching he taught them how to find their own compelling startup-story and how to pitch it to an audience.Michael Buchecker on ELEVATE Batch 3“This year’s batch is amazing!”After having worked with various incubators and accelerators over the years Michael decided to share his expertise with batch 3. In his opinion, the focus on bots and applied AI as well as the provision of growth hacking and development support clearly differentiates ELEVATE from other accelerators.When asked what comes to mind when thinking about the “Lean”- model taught there, he smugly replies by quoting Back to the Future: “Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need roads.” – Lean means effective and important: the best ideas are not worth anything if they don’t solve a problem.

Do you need to build a fancy product with extensive capabilities or did you completely overshoot and miss the core value your audience needs? As always with the lean approach, the answer lies in testing – you need to find out what your customers need and what exactly works for them. So how do you do that? You build an MVP – a minimal viable product, a topic Valentina Gredler is an expert on.Valentina on MVPsMy name is Valentina – I have been a Growth Hacker for more than 4 years now as well as being a mentor for the ELEVATE program.Affectionately called Vali by colleagues, Valentina has worked with start-ups on every project imaginable.

Now, as a mentor for ELEVATE, she does not only help founders with marketing but also with business evaluation and strategic decisions.During her workshop for Batch 3 she helped our start-ups with creating their own MVP as well as showing them ways to get people to test it.Vali, why is creating an MVP so important?Testing out your business hypotheses is crucial – not only do many start-ups develop irrelevant products, many fail to see what their core audience need. Testing the MVP enables you to verify your hypothesis as well as finding the concrete needs of your audience.Which brings us back to the Lean approach: You build your MVP, test it and measure the outcome – then you implement what you learned.This lean approach is Valentina’s absolute mantra and also number 1 tip to share:Believe in data and not your or anybody’s gut feeling.In her opinion this is also what makes ELEVATE stand out from other accelerator programs:We help start-ups hands on with evaluation, business modelling, marketing and IT – Also we remind them to keep on track and stay true to the lean start-up mantra.Build – Measure – Learn","November 6, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Natalie-Korotaeva-scaled-377x220.jpg"

She told us about her product, her recent f***ups as well as Espresso Labs cooperation with ELEVATE so far.There will be f***ups, there will be roadblocks – but there will also be accomplishmentsEspresso Labs – Voice Applications for enterprisesA relaxing day at the hotel, what more could you ask for? How about a voice-controlled personal assistant in your room? This is what Espresso Labs can do for you.Vijay Nandwani, Shubhang Arora and Pallavi went out to provide convenience to customers as well as to ease coordination efforts for hotels. For that purpose they founded Espresso Labs, targeting higher-rank hotels and providing voice applications for their guestrooms.By customizing Google Home as well as Amazon’s Alexa they enable customers to simply voice service requests while the hotel staff is notified momentarily. Thus, cutting out a lot of time and effort needed to request and book certain services.Elevating the businessAfter putting in 7 months of work prior to the program they joined ELEVATE Batch 3 in October and promptly saw results. The 1st session was all about validating your MVP, so that’s what they did:Together with their coaches, Bernhard and Tanya, they built a demo video with Google home that helped hotels with upselling their services. The feedback received after sharing the video with the Espresso Lab community was astounding – it even led to a conversion!Hyatt Regency – one of the highest reputed hotels in Dheli and the national capital region decided to become a pilot tester. They wanted to have the device installed in 10 of their premier suites, which would be a breakthrough with any startup. But, as it goes, it also lays the ground for their recent f***up story.The Google struggleThe Espresso Labs team agreed to deliver 10 Google Home devices ready and going within two weeks to the Hyatt Regency. Standard procedure – preparing and providing 10 devices within two weeks would pose no hassle for the young entrepreneurs.Hadn’t Google interfered with the plans.Google home only provides an application for doing bookings and reservations in early access so far, with strictly limited access. Espresso Labs was not among the lucky bunch, Google denied their application.Solution: Switching over to Amazon’s echo, which meant acquiring ten of those, as renting the devices to the hotel was part of the deal. After then, things were sailing smooth.That’s how things are in startups, they go south – you as co-founders have to find a solution for it.Espresso Labs conquers EuropeSince already before coming to Austria Pallavi and her team have been in contact in Viennese hotels – exploring the hierarchy, building relationships and testing the market. Our hotels might become a lot more convenient in the near future – Espresso Labs is a team that is keen on finding their way into the European market.","November 15, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/alexa-voice-assistants-scaled-377x220.jpg"

The keynote was held by Ben Goertzel, book author and Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics.If this rings any bells, you might know Sophia, a humanoid robot designed to look like Audrey Hepburn:Ben emphasized the importance of general AI. The AI we are using and advancing right now is narrow AI. It’s the type of Artificial Intelligence that is good at carrying out specific tasks, such as Alpha Go is better than humans at playing the board game Go.General AI, however, will be able to generalize tasks and also be able to perform when conditions of the tasks change. Ben predicts general AI to take off in the next 3 to 8 years – a paradigm shift that will have a huge impact on human nature. When asked if this doesn’t scare him, he simply said ‘General AI might be scary and dangerous, but so was evolving out of caves’.Of fear about job loss and future applicationsAnother topic raised was the fear that AI might take away people’s jobs. Ben laughed and said: ‘ 10 years ago, everyone was afraid that AI might kill us all – like in the Terminator movies. Now, everyone is afraid of loosing their jobs. What are they afraid of – being unemployed the 10 years before the machines kill them?’According to Ben, the future applications of AI are exiting and widespread. The topics he is most fascinated about are humanoid robots and the combination of AI and humans (eg. A neural race à la Elon Musk). The latter could help humans to keep up with AI. However, Ben raised a certain issue: not all people might want to be ‘transformed into a cyborg’ and might resist against being advanced by technology. Ben argued that these people might not be able to keep up with the mental capacity of the once deciding to opt-up.He jokingly said ‘maybe there will be a Zoo of non-technology users’.","April 20, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/daniel-plan-OE7jKpsk7uU-unsplash-1-377x220.jpg"
"28","https://theventury.com/blog/get-ready-for-voice-search/","TheVentury","Get ready for Voice Search!","This article will give you insights about how to optimize your website for voice search and how voice SEO is gaining more relevance in 2020. We’ve come such a long way. Since the days of early voice recognition as a dictation tool, through the first releases of Siri and other voice assistants, to the ever-present voice-enabled speakers we see today – we’ve watched voice shape up as a legitimate and socially accepted form of input over the past years. As the accuracy and availability develops more and more by the day, people are increasingly using their voice assistants and smart speakers to search the web. But this presents a whole new set of challenges that you’ll need to overcome. Voice SEO doesn’t play by the same rules as regular SEO.But there are some measures you can take to make sure this trend doesn’t leave your website at the seventh page of Google’s search results. In just a few simple steps, you can get your SEO ready for the future! Let’s first understand why voice search is important today. How big of a deal is voice search?Voice Search has been around for a while, but never really taken off as a main way for people to search for things online. That’s probably because voice recognition technology hasn’t always been as accurate and fast as it’s become today. Combining that fact with the increasing presence of voice-enabled devices in the household, it’s easy to imagine that we’re going to start seeing more searches leaving the confines of text. There is a frequently misquoted prediction that voice search will cover a whopping 50% of total searches in 2020. This forecast came from Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu, and was specifically based on the state of voice and image search in China. The global reality, across both mobile and desktop, is a bit different. That being said, the share of voice searches is steadily growing, and to ignore its rise would be just as foolish as to parrot misinterpreted predictions.Out of voice searches, 60% are predicted to come from screenless devices like the Amazon Echo, or Google Nest Hub. The repercussions of this are significant for SEO and keyword optimization. Where typed-out search queries are often carefully crafted and rather formal, voice searches are more conversational and casual. Most voice searches start with the word “how” and are three times more likely to be geographically specific than text searches (often ending with modifiers like “near me”). Screenless search results may also mean that search marketers need to consider how they structure their meta descriptions. Maybe we’ll even see web standards proposed to help search engines navigate and deliver voice search results. In any case, change is coming! Voice <U+2665><U+FE0F> ScreenWith the emergence of smart speakers that also have screens, we’re seeing an interesting opportunity to augment voice apps with visuals. That’s interesting because, according to Tobias Dengel of Willowtree, the average person can type 40 words per minute (wpm), but speak 130. Conversely, we can read 250 wpm, but can only listen to 130. Just based on the math here, you can see there’s a big potential for applications employing voice recognition and visuals together. Voice SEO recommendations Let’s get you started with some easy first steps: Write content in a natural, conversational tone – it’ll be more likely to match what users voice-search forFocus more on semantic search – you can read more details about this here, but generally, make sure you use your content to answer people’s questions clearly and concisely, and use internal linking strategically.Try to work more on user intent – Figure out what you users search for, and make content that answers these questions. This will increase your chances of making into to the top of Google’s search results, and maybe even to Result 0. You can do research about this using a tool like AnswerThePublic. Include longer tail keyword phrases to reach users – Extra points if everything matches up – Search query, title, body text, URL!Integrate Structured Data in your web pages to help search engines – Here’s a great blog from Yoast to help you understand how this works.Start working with SPEAKABLE property in schema.org to provide identification for sections that are suited for audio playback using text-to-speech (TTS) – this will provide a great user experience on voice-enabled devices and may lift your chances of reaching Result 0.These few tips will already make a great effort towards making your site more future-proof. Generally though, it’s safe to say voice search is not the reason you aren’t getting enough search traffic today. First and foremost, you still need to optimize for text search, as the main search mode in 2020 – but it can never hurt to be prepared for the ever-changing future.","March 17, 2020","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/computer-767776_1920-377x250.jpg"
"29","https://theventury.com/blog/growth-hacking-explained/","TheVentury","What the (growth) hack? Growth Hacking explained!","Even today, so many traditional marketers and managers still think about growth hacking or growth marketing as some sort of fluffy trend that belongs to the startup world. What we see from such conversations is that people still have many misconceptions around the topic of growth marketing.Actually, companies all over the world have been choosing this approach for almost 10 years now. That’s why we’ve decided to pick this topic up again and go back to the basics. This article answers the question of what growth hacking actually is, while explaining the core principles.BUT PLEASE, SOME STORYTELLING FIRST!It was in 2010 when Sean Ellis published a blog article explaining that a growth hacker “is a person whose true north is growth. Everything they do is scrutinized by its potential impact on scalable growth.” And so, the term growth hacking was born and many people within the startup scene positively responded to the concept.A huge number of articles, books, experts and companies successfully dedicated themselves to the topic in the following years. You may have come across names like Eric Ries and Neil Patel, who contributed in spreading the idea on an international scale. Eric Ries mainly made efforts in the field of entrepreneurship, while Neil Patel developed himself as an online marketing icon especially for SEO.Well-known and established companies like Dropbox and Airbnb applied the growth hacking technique to their business back in their early days, and still do so. Some may say that this approach played a vital role in becoming one of the highly valued tech unicorns. So, as you can see, it’s not only a success story of specific people or companies. It is also one of a business concept.OKAY, OKAY, ENOUGH OF THIS HISTORY LESSON. LET’S LOOK INTO WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!Basically, growth hacking is a marketing technique that is used to generate growth for your business. To do this, it combines various disciplines ranging from IT to marketing to controlling. It’s a data-driven process of rapid experimentation along the whole marketing funnel and across all channels to identify the most efficient ways to grow.<U+0001F646> You only have one job – or, well, one goal.Ideally, every company has at least one goal that it strives to reach. All functions and processes within the organization should be aligned in contributing to this goal. This is also true for growth hacking. Its only purpose is to contribute to this goal – AKA North Star. Growth hackers identify related metrics, and build an agile strategy around it that aims to enable them to succeed.<U+0001F50D> It’s about understanding the world, so it imitates science.Companies and their managers do have a certain understanding about their customers and the market they operate in. Sometimes these understandings are valid knowledge that was gained with great effort and experience. Other times, these understandings are simple assumptions that have never been proven. And sometimes the world we operate in changes and valid knowledge becomes obsolete.In science, we try to understand the world better. Scientists dedicate their lives to exploring our reality, finding patterns and proving them. Thereby, hypothesis-driven testing is key. In growth hacking, we choose a similar approach as we try to understand customers and markets better. Furthermore, we also want to find efficient ways to grow our business. So, a growth hacker formulates hypotheses about possible causes and effects, and then designs experiments in which to test them. The decision of validating or rejecting a hypothesis is always data-driven and evidence-based. Just like back in science class.<U+2764> It’s actually a love-story between marketing and product development.As mentioned before, growth hacking is an interdisciplinary field and not exclusive to marketers. It often interlocks marketing and product development with the goal of finding the perfect product-market-fit. In doing so, the marketer and the product developer work closely together. They use growth hacking techniques to validate whether what is built or developed is actually useful to the end-user. Developing, marketing and user feedback goes hand in hand. This helps to constantly receive feedback that confirms or rejects hypotheses and enables the product to be adapted to the market strategy accordingly.<U+0001F3A8> Stay curious, stay creative.Successful growth hackers are constantly on the lookout for new ways on how to reach their target audience. Thereby, staying up to date on the latest developments and innovations in tech and marketing are crucial. Additionally, the ability to creatively combine elements is key. Simple techniques as brainstorming with the team are used to come up with ideas that then are being tested. The key here is to think about ideas along the entire funnel, not just awareness or acquisition.<U+0001F389> Work your way through the funnel!At the core of growth hacking lies the marketing funnel. It describes the customer journey from the first contact point through the conversion, and all the way to the referral of a new customer. Growth hackers think along the whole funnel and understand that customer behavior changes throughout the sales process. This is also why growth initiatives are always set according to the stage of the funnel the target audience is currently in.There are several funnel concepts out there, which all have the same direction but slightly differ from each other. Moreover, not all address the requirements for growth marketing. At TheVentury we prefer working with the AAARRR Pirate Metrics by Dave McClure that goes beyond the simple process of awareness and conversion. It also includes stages like retention and referral, that are also on the growth marketer’s checklist.<U+0001F4C9> Yes, it’s all about data and metrics.To prove your assumptions right or wrong, and to be able to evaluate your initiatives as accurately as possible, it is important to track them. Tracking and analyzing user paths is the only way to understand user behavior and take the right steps. If it’s not worth measuring, it’s not worth doing. That’s why a big part of growth hacking involves collecting, organizing and taking action based on all kinds of data.<U+0001F4A5> Experiment, measure, optimize fast and often.The last crucial thing of growth hacking is to get into the so-called growth process or cycle. This means that growth teams begin by brainstorming as many ideas as possible. They then assess effectiveness and efficiency by looking at gathered data and adapt their initiatives accordingly. Failures are as much a part of this process as successes. The more you test, the more learnings you will gather, and this ensures a higher probability of finding the sweet spot for growing your business.Help me grow my company!WATCH OUT FOR MORE!As you can see, growth marketing is simply a mindset or approach you choose on how to do marketing, which maximizes growth in an efficient way. At TheVentury, we think that it is the best technique to reach your company goal and to stay ahead of your competition in this fast-changing world.

This is why we recently started to block four hours a week for every Venturer to do some research and gain new knowledge in fields where they want to improve, or in which they are interested. We love to learn new things and are proof that lifelong learning is not just an empty phrase. Since we try to give our clients as much knowledge about their project as we can, people are also highly encouraged to share their insights and takeaways from their research with their colleagues in form of small talks or workshops. In that way everybody benefits from the new gained knowledge of others, which also has a direct effect in improving our daily tasks and projects. This time our focus is: bot design.Simon Morel on Conversational Interface DesignOn Friday, we were lucky enough to hear from bot designer Simon Morel, partner & Head of Product at BotSupply some insights on how to make bots ‘that don’t suck’! The key takeaway is that when you are developing chatbots, you are designing an experience for the user, and you need to ensure that you’re adhering to design principles that have evolved in other spheres. Bots should be for everyone, and you need to design them appropriately.Simon was keen to stress that bots are just a small part of AI-powered solutions, which will fundamentally change how we interact with computers – bots are, in many ways digital spokespeople for brands and organisations, and they should link to other AI-powered solutions within this role. This means that for bots, conversations are at the forefront of the way that users interact with the AI, so the focus on design needs to be on that, before you even get to the AI.In the same way that we saw the transition from digital to mobile, we’re going to see the transition to AI, an insight also noted by Amir Shevat in Designing Bots. No industry is going to be unaffected – we won’t be able to imagine life without it. Simon’s perspective is that a chatbot is not just a bubble showing up on a website or within Facebook messenger, we don’t want to be limited. Current criticisms of bots tend to assume a simplistic view of bots, and don’t take into account that bots will soon use not just text, but also voice, eye movement, facial expressions, body positioning and hand gestures, and that AR and VR may soon have a big part to play, though Simon lamented that in Denmark, support for Danish voice conversations is lagging behind a bit!You don’t need a computer to start designing a botSimon pointed out that when you’re designing a bot, you need to start with an analogue fashion (pencil and paper) – it’s faster and more accurate, and makes it easier to start working on the bot immediately. Don’t start with the copywriting or the character, since they will change rapidly and are no good as a foundation. Instead, start with conversational flows, and literally draw them as flow charts. Only once this has been finalised do we move onto the digital stage.Apply the principles of character design in games and filmAfter this, you can design the character. Though sometimes we as designers don’t get to create the character at all, we should try to use what the medium of chatbots affords. Every interaction with the character should take the person into account that they are trying to imitate – what is the brand, what is the person, how do they sound? If this sounds familiar, it’s because these principles follows those of character design from games and film, and the lessons learned in that medium are just as applicable here.The bot’s function follows the data and the designOnly after all this has been completed, Simon emphasized, we move to AI. AI must follow everything else, but it can’t be forgotten – if we don’t have any tech between the data and the design, it doesn’t matter how well-designed the concept is! Designers need to remember that AI isn’t magic, though. If we want a chatbot to be super-specific, then we need the data to back it up, otherwise we can never train the AI.Finally, Simon closed by looking to the long term, and how to ensure that a bot doesn’t just die out as a flash in the pan. He returned to the idea of character design, and he questioned whether that should change as well? How do you do it without annoying the customers, and without people losing interest? Ideally, he stressed, you’d have 5-10 utterances of the chatbot’s phrases, and everything else should be subject to discussion with the client or designer. If users aren’t interested, that might be because of the service, but it might be because of how the character presents itself.Since you read until here you are maybe interested in bots in general and writing outstanding characters for bots?

"31","https://theventury.com/blog/how-to-use-tiktok-marketing-for-your-startup/","TheVentury","How to use TikTok Marketing for your Startup","TheVentury recently had the pleasure to host Sophie Pineker, responsible for Community and Partnerships Europe at TikTok, for a super informative workshop here in Vienna. TikTok with its 5.5 million active users, is one of the fastest growing social networks in the world. The insights we gained were really valuable, and I thought we’d share a few with you!What I found most interesting was that TikTok does not prioritize videos made by your friends or people you follow in your feed. I’ll describe more on that below.You can’t ignore TikTok – let’s look at the numbersIf you haven’t heard of TikTok yet, it’s about time! With 5.5 million active users, who spend an average of 50 minutes on the platform every day, this new social media platform is growing bigger and more relevant by the day. The Verge calls it “a unique hybrid somewhere between Vine and YouTube that’s captured the cultural zeitgeist among teenage smartphone owners in unprecedented fashion.”TikTok boasts 9 billion monthly video views, creating the perfect platform for people – especially young people – to get their creative message across, but also for brands looking to connect with the next generation in a meaningful way.Typical content on TikTok is in the shape of 10-15 second videos, often accompanied by popular music tracks, and typically humorous or entertaining, so the bar is high for brands who want to build a following on this platform.There are a few social features that make the app unique, and any brand who wants to conquer the TikTok world needs to find a way to use them to their own benefit.The different formats1. First off: the “For You” page (#FYP) is the first thing a user sees when they open the app (even before logging in or registering!) Content here is algorithmically curated and anything that ends up here is bound to get way more exposure. It’s the goal of many TikTok users to get their content onto the For You page.2. TikTok has licensed a lot of excerpts from popular music and offers in-app video editing and effects. The result is a signature style of vertical video content that spans the entire platform, and makes it both recognizable and easy to replicate. Many brands are successful, not by producing high-value professional video content, but by simulating the hand-held amateur style of its own target audience. Essentially, the challenge here is to make your brand become “one of the gang”.3. Hashtag Challenges are the heart of a lot of the content published on TikTok. This is where one user posts a video of a specific style, and prompts other users (via a hashtag) to recreate the video concept, each putting their own unique spin on it. Brands can also sponsor a hashtag challenge, and in one example presented to us, TikTok even helps to connect brands to influencers, who can give the Challenge the initial momentum it needs to go viral.4. Duets are also a popular way by which you can publish your rendition of a song or video. The resulting post is a collage of your own video, side-by-side with a number of its predecessors.A lot of these features are a little difficult to explain – I recommend you just download the app and try it out!Paid ads on TikTokUnlike Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, TikTok doesn’t offer “self-service ads” to brands who want to market their products. It isn’t possible to log on, upload a video, set a budget and target a chosen audience, and have your ad delivering an hour or two later.Why? This is possibly due to the app still being relatively new – we may see them adding an ad option in that sense once the product matures a little. But for now, businesses need to be in direct touch with TikTok to get their paid content campaigns onto the network. TikTok even supports brands with creating content, so it can feel as native as possible.But this also means higher entry costs. In the example presented to us in the workshop, a well-known brand paid a five-digit sum to run a “Top View” ad, which is a format that completely covers the app interface when a user opens the app, and links to an external landing page. The estimated CTR lay at around 12%, and 3,7 million impressions were reached. Of course, these numbers vary by region and on a case-by-case basis (you can contact them if you’re interested). That level of exposure is fantastic for any brand, of course, but it naturally comes with a price tag.Organic reach for brands – Authenticity is king (or queen)Of course, if you’re a startup, those kind of costs may be a little risky, if not completely impossible to afford.Which options does that leave startups then? Organic, of course! Ask yourself: how can your business navigate the various trends, memes and challenges that dominate TikTok, in a way that makes you come across as a relatable and human user, while still bring across the brand message you want to bring, and in a perfect world, even converting users to your product?That’s the big question, and it’s going to take some experimentation to answer.It’s worth taking a look at some of the approaches brands have taken so far. Companies like Chipotle, the Washington Post or Guess have all been among the earliest adopting brands on TikTok, and each have given a unique spin to their content, while keeping the authentic, casual, humorous core that makes TikTok videos so addictive with its target audience.Approaches included:Engaging in existing Hashtag Challenges while featuring their productCreating their own Hashtag Challenges and boosting them with influencer participationCreating branded filters or stickers that other users can attach to their contentFunny “behind the scenes” posts from their officesHigher production value sequences involving influencers and celebritiesWhatever you choose to do, the golden rule is simple: try to make your brand feel more like a real life TikTok user!TikTok is about content, not connectionsThere’s one more thing that makes TikTok stand out from the rest. Where other social networks have been betting on the social graph, the model that represents interconnectedness of people online, TikTok content becomes successful by other virtues. On the For You page, TikTok’s algorithm decides what you’d like to see. It doesn’t prioritize videos made by your friends or people you follow. The videos are built by influencers, brands and random people trying their luck at TikTok stardom. Whether or not you get to see their video is defined by its overall popularity and its popularity in your region, not by how socially close you are to the creator.This can be great for brands – if they can manage to create awesome content, they don’t need to worry about it getting buried by content from a user’s social connections – this continues to be a challenge on Facebook, for example. The success of a given piece of content is much more strongly defined by its objective popularity and engagement.At the end of the day, TikTok is still in its early years, and it remains to be seen what features will still be launched, both B2C and B2B. But with its current rate of growth, its predominantly young following, and its features that set it apart from what’s already out there, ignoring it might be a mistake!Have you considered using TikTok for you brand? Let me know about your experiences!","March 6, 2020","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/computer-767776_1920-377x250.jpg"

A cat, named Poncho talks to you about a whole slew of things: weather-related and not.Greg Leuch – Poncho’s Head of Product and R&D – is one of our beloved ELEVATE mentors and sat down with us on his recent Vienna-trip to share his insights about bot design, onboarding, growth hacking and the future. Got a cup of coffee ready? Sit back and enjoy Greg’s interview!What is your most valuable tip or trick?Be real & be respectful! You cannot build a product, regardless of its content or medium, without being honest and respectful to your end users. If you assume too much, send too many messages, disparage them, or you’re just annoying, your product will not work. Act natural like a casual friend will always do better than any other conversational messaging strategy. Be real & be respectful! What’s your favorite thing about chatbots?I honestly enjoy that chatbots can be many different things depending on their use case. They can be available in a variety of formats, from voice skills to SMS notifications. Chatbots have the power to reach the user like any other person in their preferred messaging app.What I enjoy even more is knowing that we’re still in the exploration phase of how conversational interfaces can impact everyday lives. Newer technologies like augmented reality and holograms combined with conversational practices can bring a richer, more engaging experience that far exceeds what has been capable in the past 20+ years of the Web. The exciting times are just around the corner and we have the ability to make the future right now. What’s your all-time favorite growth hack you experienced at Poncho?There are many great engagement tactics you can explore with read receipt events that can be used to target additional content. You’ll see Poncho use these from time to time. But really, the best growth hack is to make your chatbot relatable with content and characteristics that build a bond with the user.The best growth hack is to make your chatbot relatable with content and characteristics that build a bond with the user. What would your go-to career choice be if you weren’t working in the chatbot space?Oh wow…what a tough question! I would likely be exploring other technologies to see how we can build playful yet useful engagement and tools for personal enrichment and utility. According to you, what’s the most crucial thing for a chatbot to work?The absolutely most critical component for any chatbot is the onboarding experience. It is the only way to get a user started. Any user that is unable to get onboarded will very likely never come back to chat. Your onboarding could fail because of language differences, wrong content, too many questions/friction, or may not be exciting, respectful, or real. Make a great onboarding experience and you’ll be rewarded with lots of further potential conversations with those users. What’s your first advice to someone who tells you they want to build a chatbot?My first advice to anyone building a conversation interface, whether bot, voice skills, or other conversation interaction is to not get overwhelmed with natural language (NLP), machine learning (ML) & artificial intelligence (AI). Many conversations can be handled through simple call & response dialog flows. You don’t even need a bot to start — just start messaging your friends and test yourself! Can you describe the Chatbot scene in Vienna in one line?The Vienna chatbot community is incredibly smart and supportive. Not only those in this space, but also for international colleagues like myself that have been warmly welcomed into the community. (You’re all amazing!) What’s happening at Poncho in 2018?I’m excited for our upcoming launch on Slack. Our team has spent a lot of time learning about what makes Poncho a great one-to-one messaging product and applying that into a multi-user workspace. We’re adding a lot of new exciting features to be more than just a weather bot. If you are interested, sign up to get notified!We’ve also launched a Developer API for select partners for our weather content & data. Sign up as well if you’re interested.

"35","https://theventury.com/blog/landing-page-hashes-for-seo/","TheVentury","SEO Quality Control: How to Use Landing Page Hashes","This blog post will explain, how to optimize automatically created pages for search engines by using landing page hashes. Automated SEO is on the rise. But did you know that Google stops indexing and even crawling your pages if they become too similar among each other? At a recent meetup of Growth Hackers of Vienna (GHV on Facebook), Search Engine expert Franz Enzenhofer explained how landing page hashes can be used as a great tool to ensure uniqueness of all pages. I have put these insights together for you in the following article.Why do I need SEO Quality Control?First things first. Before we look into what landing page hashes are and why and how you should use them, I would like to start by thinking about why quality control is essential. When Google crawls and indexes pages on the web, its highest concern is to deliver good value to its users. As the crawler is “only” a machine, its ability to judge a page’s quality is restricted and relies on certain standardized indicators. One of them is a page’s uniqueness: if a website’s pages and content are repeated over and over, it certainly does not deliver additional value to users. While this is typically not an issue for manually created pages, it definitely can be severe for:MarketplacesAggregatorsPlatforms of all kindsLarge e-commerce sitesFor example, this issue – also referred to as “self-spamming” – occurs if one shop category coincides largely with another category, and hence their corresponding result pages will overlap too. If Google recognizes this, it first stops indexing the pages in question, or worse, rejects to crawl them at all – which often defeats the very SEO purpose why these pages were created in the first place.What are Landing Page Hashes?Now let’s look into landing page hashes. In general, a hash function takes some input to calculate a unique hash value of some fixed size from it. In the case of Landing Page hashes, this input basically is the content of a certain web page, or a unique ID for each single item on the page. Neither for Google’s crawler, nor for the hash function, it matters how the single items are sorted on each page. Thus:A landing page hash is a sort independent and comparable identifier of the visible items on a list landing page.How do you use this knowledge?If the number of your pages to compare is limited – for example in the case of category results or list pages – you can resort to out-of-the box tools calculating page similarities. For instance, if you are concerned about two shop categories overlapping, you can use Small SEO Tool’s Page Comparison. Simply copy-and-paste your URLs to compare, and receive a similarity score. For example, if there is a lot of similarity, you can now readjust your categories to reduce the overlap and thus improve SEO.If the number of your pages is too large for these tools to handle, you (or your developer) will have to set up a hash comparison manually in your website’s backend. There, comparing landing page hashes represents a relatively simple, quick and scalable way to automatically check how similar each of your pages are to all the others – which would otherwise take an eternity for large platforms consisting of hundreds or thousands of pages.This can be done the following way:Assign each page element (for example products in a web shop) a unique ID and save this ID to a variable.Use these variables as input and call a locality-sensitive hashing function on them. Only locality sensitive hashing will preserve your pages’ similarity in a meaningful way (other hashes create huge variation even from tiny differences). The individual hashing function will depend on the programming language used in your backend (for example PHP or Node.js).Compare the hash of each page with all the other pages’ hashes, for example by using Levenstein distance, which represents a good measure of similarity.How to leverage these insights:Equipped with the insights of your pages’ similarity, you can:Rework your whole website’s hierarchy and SEO strategy to produce more unique pagesAdjust your list pages and (shop) categories in order to produce less overlap with othersGenerate an XML sitemap that only lets Google index the more relevant pagesFor example, you can adapt the script that generates new XML sitemaps – most probably overnight – to also produce a daily report on identical and nearly identical pages. If several pages are very similar, only communicate the more relevant to the search engines via the sitemap, or mark the less relevant ones “noindex”.For more details on using landing page hashes for SEO, take a look at Franz Enzenhofer’s article on Medium.com.If you liked this blogpost, stay ahead of the competition by following Growth Hackers of Vienna on Facebook, or join the LinkedIn Group!","May 15, 2020","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/launch-rocket-spaceship-startup-business-PR7JGBM-scaled-377x250.jpg"
"36","https://theventury.com/blog/launch-startup-vienna/","TheVentury","Why should I launch my startup in Vienna?","The third post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.We know how vital funding is to every startup. As a developing market, it seems that Vienna is actually the perfect launch point for younger, seed-stage startupsVienna – from a startup village to an early-stage empire! Recently, TheVentury moved into its new office at weXelerate, the newest and biggest startup hub in Europe.So far, I like this place a lot. It checks all the right “entrepreneur” boxes: high and unfinished ceilings, well lit, startup ads everywhere, table games, and about three different open spots where you can grab a coffee. Not to mention the escalators make me feel like I’m in Tron.From the smaller, cozier office we used to occupy, we’ve moved into the largest hub in the city. If it looks like Silicon Valley and it feels like Silicon Valley, well, maybe we’re on our way…but I won’t get carried away.TheVentury’s beautiful new home, the weXelerate coworking spaceA startup’s ability to gain funding is absolutely vital at some stage in its existence. In Vienna, there are plenty of VC funds and angels looking for new opportunities, but it wouldn’t be the right place to look for late-stage capital. The largest VC in the country has a fund of about $100 million. While this is certainly a large pile of cash, it wouldn’t be able to support something like Snap’s series C of $50 million without a lot of help.Seed round funding usually falls pretty close to $1 million, however, and many are below. There would certainly be enough capital here to support a number of seed stage startups.I think it’s a good sign that a leading VC focuses the majority of its funds on seed investments. It shows that they are looking for the highest potential companies that also show rapid growth, that they’re turning over new stones instead of admiring the old.The Austrian government is beginning to notice entrepreneurial growth as well: in 2015, they granted $325 million to 3,715 startups. In this narrative, it seems, the government executives are the good guys. Imagine that you have a revolutionary idea, and you just moved to Vienna. You have a few friends interested in getting involved, but they insist that if you’re going to sell your soul to this idea, you should get started somewhere else. Why?Venture capital has a much bigger presence in Silicon Valley. There is so much capital available that a $100 million fund is not uncommon, maybe even scoffed at by some of the giants on Sand Hill Road.But let’s look at some of the seed investments coming from Sand Hill: Redpoint Ventures, $2.3 million to Lilt Inc. in October 2016; Andreessen Horowitz, $3.2 million to OpenInvest in May 2017; Greylock Partners, $1 million to Mira in September 2017. Now let’s check out here: Speedinvest, $1.9 million to ClauseMatch in June 2017, and $3.9 million to Inkitt in September 2017.Even though Redpoint has had ten funds ranging from $180 million to $750 million, they’re putting up the same amount of capital as Vienna-based funds for seed-stage investments.So why, again, would you need to relocate? Vienna is the perfect market for early- and seed-stage companies. There might be less competition for funding and you can still get the capital you need.And when it’s time to go for a series A, you’ll already have expanded beyond the borders of Austria and into other markets—more and more VCs will have noticed you.In my opinion, seeing the Austrian government free up so much funding specifically for entrepreneurs is the clearest indicator of progress to come. Despite the youth of the entrepreneurial scene here, more and more students and workers will decide to make the leap when they know they can get financial backing.So, what is the advantage of starting a business in Vienna? Over the past few years, it’s gone from a startup village to an early-stage empire, the ideal platform to really get started and grow from the actual epicenter of Europe. Once you have established yourself comfortably with the couple hundred million euros accessible here, every other European market is your friendly neighbor.","December 15, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chatbot-3589528_1280-377x220.jpg"

Of course we had to go. But the way – if you aren’t 100% sure what Lean Startup means, feel free to read my previous blog post where I point out it’s core principles.Here are our key learnings from the conference: Metrics in InnovationYes, every business needs metrics to validate whether an initiative is following the right path. But: businesses need to define their own Innovation Metrics without limiting themselves from going beyond measuring. There is no one-fits-all solution. If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you’ll be amazed by the results.– General George S. PattonThe “north star metric” is a key metric that is directly aligned to the value that a company creates for a client. It ensures that the team chooses the right path. If you give people a mission instead of detailed plans, expect better outcomes.Becoming a leader in InnovationLeadership in Innovation needs to be trained. This enables organizations to make the shift from product-centered organizations to human-centered organizations – in which both customer and employee are valued above all else.Want to know more about this? Check out this amazing book.Culture in InnovationEntrepreneurial cultures:Can be fostered through the ways we daily interact within an organizationAre built when everyone understands the product vision. Can everyone answer the question “where are we building towards”?Depend on being able to empathize with the employees – what matters to them?Need constant feedback loopsAre built when expectations and priorities are communicated clearlyNeed adoptable peoplemake teams love solving the problem rather than building the productFailure in InnovationBusinesses need to be brave and embrace failure to achieve future success.Think of ants.An ant population always sends 5% of their population to the “edges” – to some other place where they could find new food sources. The rest of the population works on their core and takes care of day-to-day business.Ants invest in trial and error. And so should you. Best by making use of Lean Startup methodology.

"38","https://theventury.com/blog/lean-startup/","TheVentury","Lean Startup Explained","On the 12th of February the “Lean Startup Summit” took place in Berlin.Since I am a huge fan of the Lean methodology, I knew I had to attend this conference. With big expectations I went to two-day summit and joined like-minded people in Berlin. People who are eager to exchange thoughts and learn about different takes on entrepreneurship within large corporations but also tiny startups.I’ll spare you the wait: I wasn’t disappointed.But let’s start at the very beginning and go into the basics of the Lean Startup approach before we dive into deeper context. In the following blog I will be explaining what Lean Startup means and why this approach is so valuable.Lean Startup: Innovation is “hit or miss”, isn’t it?Whether you are launching a tech-startup, work as a corporate innovator or are trying to contribute to your local community by providing a small business based on demand – it always feels like a “hit or miss” position. You build your business plan, and either it works out or it doesn’t – correct?Wrong.It’s a common misconception that building an extensive business plan is the perfect way to go. Can making assumptions and building hypotheses based on unknown factors and variables before experiencing it first hand really be viable?As a matter of fact, creating a static business plan takes a lot of time. It is often being written by an individual under exclusion of the public (e.g. potential customers / stakeholders) and includes a 5-year forecast for costs, profits and potential margins that make oracles seem like phonies. Rationally speaking, it is not a big surprise that this approach has a low success-rate. This approach of working on extensive research behind closed doors without any real-world validation will most likely result in a plan based on fiction. Nevertheless, large companies and start-ups often work straight by this book. They stick to this principle in order to convince investors and potential partners with their ideas.But what is the alternative?One that seems promising is called “Lean Startup”, that – contrary to the name – can help startups AND corporates with their initiatives by following these three key principles, according to Steve Blank:Generate your HypothesesRather than investing time and money in months of planning, founders should summarize their hypotheses in a framework called “Business Model Canvas”.The “Business Model Canvas” basically describes how a company/project/business model creates value for the potential customers and itself.Collect FeedbackLean Startup uses the approach of “Customer Development”. That means validating the defined hypotheses in “field interviews” (yes, people go out and actually talk to their potential target groups to collect feedback). In these interviews potential customers and target groups are asked about their opinions and pains, going through all elements of the “Business Model Canvas” to revise assumptions and generate essential learnings. Develop your first sketchThe method of Lean Startup utilizes “agile development”. This term is probably well-known to all the IT Developers among the readers. Unlike typical IT Project release cycles, you focus on iterative development based on short feedback cycles to ensure alignment with customers’ benefit. This is usually the moment when startups and corporate innovation teams test their hypotheses based on a very first version of the product, called MVP. The lean approach is centered around the customers and their ever changing needs – thus making you agile and more resisting to failing. And personally, I think that that’s exactly what you need.Now, that you have an overview over the basics of a Lean Startup – what it means, where it is applicable and what the basic methods are, let us dive deeper into the topic!Make sure to check out my post with my key learnings & insights from the Lean Startup Summit 2019 in Berlin.Get in touch to find out how the LEAN approach can benefit your company.

How many hours do you spend each week doing repetitive tasks? Probably enough – but digitization has reached the point where marketing automation will free you from this burden.What is Marketing Automation?Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one of 2020’s hottest business topics: in fact, the industry’s turnover shot from US $100mn in turnover by 2012 to an expected US $5bn this year, according to Statista.com. Of course, this revolution doesn’t stop at the domains of marketing. In this short blog post, we will show you 3 simple automations digital and growth marketing managers can implement right away – without knowing how to code at all. This will not only help you save some of your valuable time, but also – if done well – to increase your marketing’s reach many-fold at no additional cost.1. ZapierUse Zapier for Process Automation – No coding skills required Recently, Robotic Process Automation has become increasingly viable for smaller businesses and startups. While most RPA software is in effect only affordable for larger corporations, Zapier is different: with it’s free version or prices starting at € 19.90 per month, it is the natural choice of most SMEs and startups.Zapier works by simply connecting numerous services and enabling them to interact with their corresponding APIs. For example:A lead fills out a Google Form on your Website: this triggers the Workflow within ZapierZapier takes the information from Google Forms, and sends it to an Excel sheet prepared by you, including a whole set of complex calculations.Zapier updates your customer database and CRM tools.A new task is created automatically in your project management tool, for example Jira or Asana.Your team receives a notification, including your Excel model’s results and a link to your CRM entry via email, Slack, or whatever channel you prefer.As Zapier supports more than 2.000 different applications from ActiveCampaign to Zendesk, this creates a myriad of possibilities – not only for marketing automation, but just about anything. Plus: if you know Python, add your own code, and create even more complex workflows.2. The LinkedIn HelperA tool for LinkedIn B2B Marketing Automation LinkedIn Helper enables you to increase your reach on LinkedIn to personal profiles, for instance by automatically sending requests and messages, or inviting your contacts to like your page. Hence, this is a Tool primarily to be used by your sales staff. To begin with, simply download the tool from https://linkedhelper.com/download – the subscription starts at €8 per month.I have put together a quick step-by-step guide for you. Follow these steps after the installation was done:Open your LinkedIn profile. On the right bottom corner open the LinkedIn Helper, and select “Collect, Select & Invite 2nd & 3rd party contacts”.Create a new list of people to reach out to. Go back to LinkedIn’s search page, set your search filter by entering keywords or companies plus the relevant location.On the LinkedIn Helper, click “Collect contacts for inviting”. Your new list will populate now automatically, which takes a while – don’t close the window. When its done, you can go through your invitation list, and exclude specific people manually.When your list is ready, switch to LinkedIn Helper’s message tab to enter your message – you can even personalize it by entering the variables of people’s names, positions and companies.LinkedIn doesn’t really like bots like this one (though it is legal to use them). Therefore, you can reconfigure LinkedIn Helper’s regular timeouts, which models human behavior, and makes the bot impossible to be detected. Here, you can also increase the invitation speed up to 100 invites per day.Hit “Start profiles inviting” – and there you go! You have to keep the tab selected and open, but can open additional new windows to keep working in while LinkedIn Helper does its job.After sending your invitations, you can also export your invitee list as a .csv file. For more detailed information, you can check out this tutorial.3. ScrappyWeb Crawling and Web Scraping: A special tip for Startups with Platform Business Models A final tip especially for startups building platform business models: As you are facing the hen-and-egg dilemma when simultaneously building demand, while there is not even enough supply on your platform yet, try to emulate the supply right away. Your solution to do so? Web Scraping!Imagine you build a platform to book holidays on farms (very Austrian, I know), but you don’t get any farms to sign up because you don’t have sufficient users. And your users don’t like your platform – because there are not enough farms around. Then save yourself half the hassle and solve one side of your equation by crawling the web for farms offering rooms to rent. Scrape the information and put it onto your platform too. The farms won’t be mad about their additional coverage, and you will offer plenty of options to your users.A great open-source and free-to-use tool for web crawling is Scrapy. Or simply use Python’s Beautiful Soup library as a web scraping tool pulling out website data, using the pages’ document object model (DOM). Your developer (or one of ours) will be happy to set it up.What next?Pretty neat what automation can do for you, right? Now that you have a brief overview, its probably time to dig deeper into your favorites with some tutorials.

We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.Starting off today is Botplan from San Mateo, USA. Botplan’s chatbot converts online traffic into leads for real estate agents and brokers by instantly providing answers to customer’s questions online. We asked Jatinder Singh, Botplan co-founder & newly discovered Käsekrainer & Glühwein addict a couple of questionsWhen and how was your first experience with a bot?My first chatbot experience was on NewsBytes chatbot on Facebook Messenger.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Yes – Botplan’s Chatbot for Real Estate ?. The best in the business.Why should someone use your solution / What is the problem you are solving?Real estate agents spend on average $400 a month driving traffic to their websites. However, they are not able to convert that traffic into leads, simply because their websites lack a live engagement tool. A real estate lead in the US is worth $4000 on average. Our tool costs only $9.95 per channel per month. Even if our tool only provides one incremental leads a month, it will offer an RoI of 40,000%What’s your bot‘s superpower?At the core, our bot is a Lead Capture bot; we have designed it to be very respectful in capturing lead information. E,g., it seeks customer’s permission on their preferred way to be contacted. It also allows customer to talk about their availability for an appointment using natural language like “any time tomorrow after 2 pm”. It works like an experienced receptionist that can work with very little inputs from the customer and make appropriate decisions.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a bot?My advice is to start building a bot using off the shelf solutions to evaluate whether your bot solves a real problem. Once you get feedback from actual users, then start thinking about what tech stack will really help you build a bot that serve the needs of those actual users. This early feedback from the market is essential in making sure that the time and resources spent on building the comprehensive chatbot are well spent.Since you are based in the US and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.I have always wanted to visit Vienna, and I was super lucky to come to Vienna just when the Christmas season started. I really enjoyed the Christmas markets around town and especially the one at City Hall. The Gluhwine is not to be missed at the Christmas markets. Vienna has great food and cafes, which are fairly affordable. Overall, I loved my first trip to Vienna and I am looking forward to go back for future meet ups.What was the weirdest thing you got to know/do in Austria?Drink beers while I am walking the street ?Your last words to the community (for now)?The team at ELEVATE is experienced, smart, kind, and friendly. They are not only helping us with our chatbot, but also made introductions to local Angel funds within my first week of joining ELEVATE.

So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.This week, get to know Growthbotics, a chatbot that solves the difficulty of Google Analytics by simpliying and analyzing critical data for B2B industries such as digital marketing agency and Ecommerce.Wilson Kao, co-founder of Growthbotics from Taipeh, told us about his first experience with a bot and gave his insights in building a chatbot. But read for yourself: When and how was your first experience with a bot?My first experience was when I had some issues with login registration for Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange platform, I had to contact their help support which was initially filtered by their customer support chatbot.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Woebot, it is a AI NLP (Artificial Intelligence Natural Language Processing) chatbot for mental health patients who prefer talking to robots and in return, the robots provide Cognitive Behavioral Therapy by engaging in conversations.Why should someone use your solution / What is the problem you are solving?Anyone who uses Google Analytics and needs knowledge about their website performance can use our chatbot. We are solving the inconvenience, complexity and analytical limitation of GA.What’s your bot‘s superpower?AI NLP and Predictive Analysis algorithm. You don’t need to hire a data scientist to predict your business traffic and find business insights, a chatbot can do it for you with substantially lower costs.Why did you choose Elevate?It’s the best bot accelerator in the world. I was in another accelerator before and I must add that the people behind ELEVATE are very friendly folks.What are your expectations for the program?To find product/market fit and scale enough for VC funding.Since you are based in Taiwan and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.We imagined it to be a romantic city and it turned out to be very romantic indeed. It’s definitely not the same as Germany!What was the weirdest thing you got to know/do in Austria?Public toilets are not free! We are excited to have you in Vienna, Team Growthbotics!

"42","https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-iconic/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Iconic","Our next team has travelled far to take part at Elevate – Sandesh and Vishakha from Team IconicBot fly in from India for our monthly meetups! Vishakha is a well-known actor and film producer and Sandesh is a former IBM’ler who is responsible for the tech at IconicBot. Please give us a short description of your chatbot: We bring fans and their icons together. We use Artificial Intelligence technology to help influencers reach their true fans effectively & in no time!Why should someone use your chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?Celebrities have many fans and it is impossible for them to talk to every single one in person. This is where IconicBot steps in – it bridges the gap between fans and icons. The celebrity chatbot allows daily engagement with each individual fan and the icons benefit from higher fan engagement and a way to monetize their inbox through potential brand partnerships.How did you guys meet?We met 3 years ago and founded two start-ups together, which are currently hibernated. Vishakha has almost 10 years of experience in the entertainment industry and I have more than 8 years of technical experience. We, as a team, perfectly complement each other and therefore decided to build a bot for the entertainment industry.Why did you choose Elevate?Elevate chose us. (laughs)We are from India, which is already a huge market, but we also thought of extending IconicBot to the European market. Therefore, it is a great experience to work with different teams who have a completely different culture. Elevate is the first program that accelerates bots and is situated in Europe – so that was a perfect fit!What are your expectations for the program?In the first step, we want to deploy the bot for two major celebrities and want to target big product houses in the music industry.When and how was your first experience with a chatbot?It was not really a chatbot – my first experience was with the AI assistant Siri. In India we have a completely different fluency when we talk, and I did not really like the experience of talking to Siri.Fans who would use our bot speak more than 18 other languages. We are therefore using NLP but sort of a bot-hybrid to create a unique user experience. With that we can assure that the user likes to chat with the bot and does not perceive it as being dumb.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?You should definitely come here! The people at TheVentury are really nice and they have amazing technological knowledge. There are so many coaches to guide you and tech applications they can provide you with to which is a great help to build your startup. And, Europe is just great!Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a chatbot?Every customer only has 15 apps and the app-installation numbers have decreased. People do not engage that much with apps anymore, so penetrating the user base with an app will be quite tough. Messengers are the next big thing! People use messenger more than social media. You have to build something where you meet the consumer – a bot is ideal for that!","August 28, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8412_EAP_171123_TheVentury_Elevate-1-377x220.jpg"

We really are bursting with excitement about our 5 new teams from 4 different countries and feel thrilled to introduce them to you too. So that’s what we’re going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.Last but not least, get to know Janus, a b2b software that will act as your virtual IT-adminstrator. Barbara Haiden, co-founder of Janus from Vienna explains the Janus solution and tells us about her favorite chatbots today:Please give us a short description of your solution:Janus – our B2B software – is a virtual IT-Administrator. It can take over some of the administrator’s tasks as running, monitoring and repairing IT infrastructure (Linux based only at the moment). The chatbot is part of the software as it will be the user interface.Your definition of a chatbot?Our chatbot will be the user interface for working with our software Janus. As many of the (indirect) competitor’s interfaces are so complicated we want to make it as easy as possible and so we thought a conversational interface as a chatbot’s would be the best solution for it. Our customers can use English for communication and working with our software.Do you have a favorite chatbot?Yes, we do have more than one! For example the chatbot from our friends from the Vienna based start-up ONDEWO… Or HAL9000 from the movie 2001 a space odyssey <U+0001F642>Why should someone use your solution?The aim of our software Janus is to run, monitor and repair IT infrastructure on an autonomous basis so that the people normally dealing with that have more time for other tasks or projects.What’s your bot‘s superpower?Making the usage of our software as simple as it can be – with the help of our Janus bot.Why did you choose Elevate and what are your expectations?As we have experience in a wide range of fields (as software development, IT administration, marketing, statistics, etc.), deep knowledge in chat bot development is none of that. So we thought, that it might be a good idea to get help from some experts in this area and we applied for ELEVATE – to get better knowledge and hands-on development of our user interface/chatbot.We can’t wait to see you achieve great things, team Janus!","January 18, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/STARTPLATZ-ELEVATE-scaled-377x220.jpg"
"44","https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-jingle/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Jingle","New week. New team. Meet Team JingleGreg, Luke and Kevin are the founders of Jingle. Greg loves working on marketing and sales strategies and Luke is responsible for operations and management. Together with their ‘techie’ Kevin they make a great team which drives to excel and have fun at the same time. Please give us a short description of your Chabot: Jingle is a personal shopping assistant that helps you find local products in your proximity. Our service helps customers find specific products in their area, and furthermore include helpful information such as price and the availability in store. Thereby, we support customers as well as local retailers – we do not only find the concrete product but also bring customers back into local stores.Why should someone use your Chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?The particular problems we are facing can be split into a customer and retailer part. The customers on the one hand tackle the problem of not finding wanted products in their proximity and thereby often transitioning to online shops. Just think of the last time you wanted to buy something really fast. Did you know exactly which store to go to? Probably not, right?On the other hand, retailers try to get more customers into their physical shops but often fail at effective marketing – especially in the era of the internet. Our service solves the customer related problem by providing all the needed information at one place and thereby simultaneously solving the retailers’ problem by bringing customers back into local stores.How did you guys meet?Greg and Luke met at the university where they shared similar interests – especially entrepreneurship. Having formulated the business model over the course of last year, we decided that it was time to find the perfect technical addition to the team. After searching for quite some time, Kevin our new Co-Founder and CTO was recommended to us through our network. And we are super happy that he joined us on our path to promote local retailers.Why did you choose Elevate?After a lot of brainstorming, research and validation processes we decided to solely focus on a chatbot as we love the idea of a conversational interface – the ultimate interface. We heard about Elevate being THE go-to accelerator program specialized on building exactly that. The timing could not have been better for us and after the first initial meetings, we knew Elevate was the right fit! We are very happy and proud to be part of the bot family here.What are your expectations for the program?Together with the chatbot gurus from Elevate we want to finish developing our MVP until the end of the program while also diving further into the chatbot community. In the long run, of course, our goal is to create a bot that users love and use frequently!When and how was your first experience with a Chatbot?It was definitely NOT love at first sight. The chatbot hype in Vienna started about a year and a half ago. I was working for a start-up back then and religiously read the Buzzfeed news every evening.One particular night I saw a post about a well-known American news company that had just deployed a bot. The bot would send me tailored news every day and claimed to learn about my interests with time. I HAD to try it. Plot twist – I absolutely hated it. It was completely unclear to me how such a large company could release such nonsense, believing they where actually creating something valuable. So my first impression – not good.However, this experience lead to lots of research on NLP and AI technology. By the day my interest in chatbots started to grow up to the point where I got hooked and wanted to build my own.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?If you are a early stage start-up and you are looking forward to building a chatbot– Elevate is definitely the right program for you. It’s a great team, everyone is highly motivated, and it’s fun – exactly how it should be. Don’t hesitate to apply and find out yourself! Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a Chatbot?It should work. It should be easy to understand. And it should be fun – if you are going to build a chatbot without a character/personality, you are probably better off without a conversational interface.Want to know more about Team Jingle?

And up to 30% of leads are missed because tour operators are not reachable 24/7. Our Team Polaama is working on exactly this problem: never missing a lead anymore. Sounds good? Find out more about them at our Demo Day – join the event in person @weXelerate or remotely through the livestream on May 23rd!This week, get to know Polaama, an automated end-to-end customer engagement solution for the tours & activities industry. Madhu Parthasarathy, co-founder of Polaama and Leberkäse-lover told us about his bot’s superpowers, his favorite chatbot and gave his insights in building a chatbot. But read for yourself: When and how was your first experience with a bot?The first time I heard an automated voice ask me questions over the phone (when talking to a customer service agent) would be my first experience.Do you have a favorite chatbot?I enjoy talking to the Mitsuku chatbot. I think she has personality and is able to hold her own on most conversations.Why should someone use your solution?Imagine that you are a leisure traveler making a trip to San Francisco. You have heard a lot about the Alcatraz island and would like to go. You have identified from Trip Advisor that “SFO Alcatraz tours” is the top tour operator that offers this service.If this business used Polaama to interact with its customers, you can simply open Facebook Messenger (or any of your favorite chat applications), ask any questions and receive answers immediately and purchase tickets with one click right from the chat window. You will then receive reminders about your activity, details about what you need to bring and get directions to the place. Better still, you can start a conversation on the business’ web page and then continue the conversation from your Facebook Messenger.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a bot?First understand what problem you are going to solve and if your target customers really think it’s a problem. Then determine if a bot is the right technology to solve the problem. Once you have determined this, go full steam ahead!Why did you choose Elevate?Elevate is the first bot accelerator that also offers a team who will work with you in a hands-on role. This has already proved to be very helpful for Polaama at such an early stage.What are your expectations for the program?Go to market with a product that truly benefits my target customers.Since you are based in the US and came to Vienna specifically for ELEVATE, tell us how you imagined Austria to be and what it turned out to be.I have heard about Austria as a beautiful country (especially Vienna) and that proved to be true. It was cloudy most days but that did not take anything away from the city’s beauty. Another thing that stood out was the warmth and helpful nature of Austrians. Can’t wait to go back there.What are your last words to the community (for now)?I am excited to be part of the community and looking forward to more productive months. We are excited to have you in Vienna, Team Polaama!","January 5, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/8616_EAP_171124_TheVentury_Elevate-377x220.jpg"
"46","https://theventury.com/blog/meet-teams-toni/","TheVentury","Meet the teams: Toni","The second team we would like you to meet is Team Toni! Klemens is founder and main developer of Toni! He, Kathi who is responsible for UX and marketing, and Scott, their mentor, make up Team Toni at the moment.Please give us a short description of your chatbot: Toni is a personal football buddy on Facebook Messenger. He gives you information on all the scores, the latest results, upcoming games and news on soccer. He can provide you with real-time information or round-ups of past games. With Toni.ai we are going to redefine fan engagement by creating virtual buddies that sports fans can engage with on the popular messaging platforms. This is not just limited to football.Why should someone use your chatbot / What is the problem that you are solving?The thing about football information is, that it requires a lot of time to get all the information you want and often it is not personalized. With Toni we offer you your personal assistant that gives you the information you are searching for directly in the channel you already know and use – Facebook Messenger. You don’t need to install an App or log-in at a website. For leagues, clubs, and players we’ll provide a platform for increasing fan engagement and interact with fans on a personal level.How did you guys meet?The idea behind Toni arose last year for the European Football Championship 2016 where we built the first prototype. We already gained a lot of users and media coverage there. This was the beginning of the project, and now we are developing Toni further to be a general football chatbot and Toni.ai as a fan engagement platform for sports leagues, clubs, and athletes. This is also where the other teammates entered. I wanted to also include more of the business and UX side into Team Toni and therefore expanded the team.Why did you choose Elevate?Because it’s awesome! The guys are really motivated and we have the feeling that they can really support us and push Toni to a highly successful level! ELEVATE was the perfect fit for us. We had our first MVP and were thinking about how to market it and how we are going to build a business around it – and this is exactly where ELEVATE stepped in to support us.What are your expectations for the program?We really hope to have the big players of the soccer industry engaged in Toni – the big clubs or betting companies! And we want to give Toni a unique personality and attract as much users as possible!When and how was your first experience with a chatbot?My first experience was a news bot. It was very nice to get information, but it was not really personal. That’s something we want to do better with Toni – we really want to personalize the content. The user should feel welcome and see Toni as a friend.What would you recommend to applicants interested in ELEVATE batch #2?Do it! If you think about applying – just apply! Have fresh ideas, find a good team and then you will get support from TheVentury and it will give your product a push.Do you have any advice for peers interested in building a chatbot?The chatbot scene is changing very fast. You can now create bots without needing any coding skills. If you are living in Vienna, there is a lot going on: there are monthly meetups in the bot scene, there are hackathons and so on.And if you want to talk about bots, just get in touch with us!

Yes, I’m hyped! Why, you wonder? Because I just came out of a session with 10 brilliant people from all over the world, who happened to still share the same level of excitement and enthusiasm as they did this February, when we kicked off Batch #5 of ELEVATE. Yes, I’m talking about the founders of the four startups we are currently working with.A group of people that give me, personally, immense joy and appreciation for what I get to do every day. But it’s not only me who loves the time we get to spend with the startups:Working with startups from our acceleration program ELEVATE is an integral part of what we do at TheVentury. Our accelerator for AI & Machine Learning startups helps us to keep up to date on the newest technologies and gives us a chance to pass on our experience in building hypotheses-driven companies. Plus, it’s so much fun, we wouldn’t want to miss it for the world – the crazy times included!Today, we’re happy to introduce our newest additions to the ELEVATE family to you. Our Batch #5 startups and the amazing people behind them. We’re proud to have picked a bunch of passionate, hard-working and all-around great people to be part of this year’s batch and cannot wait to introduce them to you. So, without further ado: meet our Batch #5 startups!MidibrainCountry: AustriaMichael Krautsieder, the genius behind Midibrain, and a musician himself, has made it his goal to make the process of creating and producing music easy and intuitive, without having to get into the depths of music theory.The first app of the Midibrain series, Chord Progression Generator, has been built already by Michael, who is not only a musician, but also a developer, and has 110K downloads so far. Currently, he is working on the second app in the Midibrain family – also a tool for music producers. You can find out more about that one at our Demo Day. <U+0001F609>Michael is not only one of the newest additions to the ELEVATE family, but also to our office, as he moved into the space two months ago as well. And we have to say, we really enjoy having you and your getting things done attitude around, Michael!Oh and also: he is looking for a CMO/Co-founder who is just as excited about music producing as he is and who will take over the business side of things. Interested? Find out more about it here.Midibrain with their ELEVATE tag teamAvasa AI Country: UKWho of you has ever struggled with the process of finding a new home? When Mayank, one of the founders of Avasa AI asked our team this question for the first time, every single person raised their hands. And that’s exactly what the fantastic people behind Avasa AI are helping with: the stress and hassle of apartment/house hunting.Over the past year, Avasa AI has supported hundreds of house-hunters with their hyper-personalized home search that focuses on the tenant’s needs. On this quest, they are now going another step: empowering HR departments to support their new graduate employees and expats in finding homes fast and easy. This ultimately improves employee productivity and mental well-being.The team behind Avasa AI knows what they are talking about – the idea was born out of Mayank’s frustration when he was first house hunting in London. A couple of months later, when he was thinking of the idea for Avasa AI, he called Octavian, one of the real estate agents from his home search days, the one who was most helpful, and asked him to start a company together. The team is complemented by Rajnish, who Mayank met on a flight 11 years ago and who does not only have 35+ years of experience in building tech products and businesses but is also an angel investor. A true experienced dream team, I would say!We love having them around, even if it is currently only through video calls. I would also like to add, that my heart warms up every time I see how Mayank is passing his experience as a founder on to the other startups in the Batch and getting collaboration going.Avasa AI with their ELEVATE tag teamDetectolabsCountry: RussiaThe team behind Detectolabs have developed a powerful image recognition software that helps retail and restaurants to understand their customers better and create personalized offers them, ultimately creating sales opportunities for them. A Google Analytics or Hotjar for offline retail, so to speak. With the same technology, they also help retailers manage their stocks, avoid empty shelves and thus cut losses in real-time.The cool thing about this solution is that it can make use of the existing cameras that are installed in stores already. And, we know what you’re thinking, of course it’s 100% GDPR compliant!Time to introduce the super smart people behind the product to you: Alex, who is on the forefront of anything business and customer interviews. Honestly, after all the interviews he has done with people in retail and hospitality, I don’t think there is anyone who has deeper insights into the industry than him. And then there is Ilya, the ambitious and clever tech partner in crime. Supported by Irina, a tough business developer and financial wizard, they are working hard every day to make Detectolabs bigger and better.Just as Avasa AI, we can’t have them around at the moment, due to the distance and the current situation. However, our weekly calls are always a highlight for us, seeing the progress they are making every single week and throwing a couple of jokes in every now and again – for example about my bad Russian. We are truly impressed how seriously the team is taking feedback and how they manage to strike a balance between taking advice and running with it but also thinking it through and deciding what makes sense for them. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for you!Detecto Labs with their ELEVATE tag teamRotable Country: AustriaRotable is working on a SAAS-solution for the HR & clinical rotation management in healthcare facilities. What does that mean, you ask? They are basically saving hospitals and their doctors and HR professionals a lot of time on the rotation scheduling of doctors in training.And when I mean a lot, I really mean a whole lot. Because hospital-groups spend up to 216 hours a week reworking their rotation scheduling in their excel files. Rotable’s SAAS-solution will do this automatically and thus free up doctors time to enable them to focus on the important things: their patients.Team rotable knows how much time, effort and brain power goes into rotation scheduling, because Lisa, one of the founders, has been the one to do exactly this across nine hospitals at the same time for years. So, she decided to change it with her dream team: Yannick, a mastermind when it comes to making things look great and David, the guy behind the algorithms. We certainly love having you in the office with us – usually – and beating you at UNO or foosball. <U+0001F609>Oh, this might be interesting for you too: rotable is currently hiring software developers – if you want to be part of a determined team with a mission, you should definitely check this out. Bonus point: the rotables are really great at Karaoke, so fun times are definitely included – I’m speaking from experience here!Rotable with their ELEVATE tag teamComing up – remote reunion in May, before our Demo Day in June! We cannot wait to reunite with our teams in May and work intensely on their growth strategy and their pitches and to prepare for our Demo Day on June 18th, 2020.

This allows saving time that is used searching for special clauses – a process which can take up to several days. This is especially helpful when a very clever clause from a previous contract can be re-used in another contract draft.Seeing the team working so hard on their idea, while also juggling several other responsibities (including being a kick-ass dad in a six head family) is an inspiration for all of us!WeDressCountry: AustriaWeDress Collective is the Airbnb for fashion.

"49","https://theventury.com/blog/mentoring-at-seedstars-world-summit/","TheVentury","Mentoring at Seedstars World Summit","For the last few days I was invited to the beautiful city of Lausanne, Switzerland and the EPFL campus for mentoring with a focus on SAAS, Chatbots and Conversational Interfaces at the Seedstars World Summit. I was not only amazed by the stunning views of lake Geneva and the still snowy mountain tops, but even more by the incredible passion and entrepreneurial spirit of all participants of the summit.Let me break down the participants:69 start-ups from emerging markets who left their regional competition behind came to Lausanne for a week to create connections to businesses, mentors and, most importantly, to each other.60+ mentors both from Switzerland and abroad (some were traveling from as far as Manila, Philippines!) supported these start-ups on their challenges and provide them with guidance96 members and volunteers of the Seedstars family helped to ”keep it swiss” (ensure everyone is on time) and make certain everyone had a great time.Day 1 – Hosting the SAAS business services mentoring sessionI was selected to host the session SAAS business services (especially bots and plugins) together with Stefan Ehrhardt from Google. We were given a tight schedule and a few topics to focus on for the five 75 minute sessions we had together with our very diverse set of 5 start-ups :SatisMeter – a customer satisfaction measurement tool from the Czech RepublicKiwix – an offline internet for people that are faced with no or bad internet connection or censorship from Swizerland/FranceWidebot – a bot builder platform and arabic NLP provider from EgyptVdoCipher – an end to end video hosting platform from IndiaEve.calls – a voice service that can handle outbound and inbound calls from the UkraineWhile it was a challenge for us to keep it relevant for all teams and making sure to spend equal amounts of time on the individual topics, the diversity also brought many different perspectives to the table. The unique ways in which these entrepreneurs are tackling the challenges of acquisition and activation, customer retention and growth not only gave the other start-ups good ideas, but also left me full of inspiration.After the day, Seedstars gathered all mentors to collect feedback which they received very well and already applied on the next day. The first day concluded with a delightful mentors dinner, where all the mentors had the chance to get to know each other and share experiences. I had the pleasure of making connections to many pioneers in their fields, such as Joseph de Leon, Steffen Kellner, Bracken Darrel, Vincent Tresno, Stefan Dobrev, Jon Attwell – and many others.Day2 – 1:1 mentoring sessions On the second day start-ups were able to select a mentor to talk about their businesses and obstacles in 1:1 meetings. Each start-up had 60 to 75 minutes to explain what they are tackling, gather feedback and enjoy a spirited discussion on what is coming next.The 4 start-ups I met with were:tootle – a 2wheeler based ride sharing solution from NepalSaipos – a cloud based POS system for the food industry in BrazilTunga – an AI and NLP provider from MongoliaPayit – peer to peer payment provider from Mexico.I was as much humbled for being chosen as a mentor, as I was impressed by hearing the different backstories of the founders and their ideas and experiencing the passion with which they are working hard to reach their goals, despite being faced with many obstacles. Interestingly enough, none of these start-ups where there to win the grand price on the summit day, but much rather to enhance their businesses through ideas, feedback and new connections.My takeaways:The solution often lies in asking the right questions. Most of the time you cannot provide an absolute solution to a challenge they might face. Instead, ask for “Which process can I use to tackle challenge X?”. This holds even more value when you are mentoring a start-up from a market you have basically no clue about.Strategy is nothing without cultural awareness and an understanding of your local customers.The way of entrepreneurship provides value everywhere.Chatbots and conversational interfaces are not just a phenomenon of the northern hemisphere. Great start-ups utilize them all over the world.From the organizers to the mentors and start-ups. All people I talked to, where incredibly open minded, receptive to feedback and appreciation.Start-ups in emerging markets focus much more on solving “real” problems and convenience often just automatically comes with it. The quality of the start-ups was high across the board and I am certain all of them have a chance to create a big impact.My gratitude goes out to Seedstars for inviting me and giving me the chance to pass on learnings and to share my experiences. And thus, after two days of countless impressions and intense conversations I hopefully provided useful guidance for a few start-ups on their journey to success. It was a pleasure to meet so many passionate entrepreneurs, who inspired and motivated me to contribute even more to the startup-community in Austria and all around the globe.","April 13, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/espresso-labs-scaled-377x220.jpeg"
"50","https://theventury.com/blog/myaustrian-messenger-service/","TheVentury","How we built the Austrian Airlines Chatbot","The idea to the Austrian Airlines Chatbot was born right after the announcement of Facebook opening up their Messenger API. To us it was crystal clear from the beginning: this is going to be huge! And because we already realized a rather big innovation project with Austrian Airlines (see flymeto.austrian.com) we approached their social media agency ambuzzador to partner with us once again to bring this innovation to Austrian.Said and done. Austrian Airlines were very quick in realizing the huge potential and allowed us to start the project.What should we do? Where to start when building a Chatbot?There were some major decision to make in conceptualizing the Chatbot. First, there was the question which functionality we should provide. What is the scope of the bot? We quickly identified that a minimal viable bot (MVB) for an airline should:be able to search for flightsprovide excellent answers to the top 5 customer support questionsbe able to handle other questions reasonably welldo small talk on a basic levelKeep in mind that this was the MVB specification. It was clear from the start onwards, that we wouldn’t be able to handle 100% of the requests successfully. So we needed an additional option:If the bot fails, hand the conversation over to a human agent for further processingThis system differs entirely from the setup that KLM is currently believed to operate on, which is: Let an AI make a suggestion and a human sign off on the message. While it is obvious that their system (for now) is more precise – because a human is still in the loop – the future potential makes our approach more powerful. Only in a solution like this one can fully materialize the potential of an AI, but keep the human capacities for edge cases and complicated requests.Hello, who is speaking?Now that we knew what to speak about, the next question was: who is speaking?There are two main strategies here: a) You create an avatar, and let that avatar speak b) The brand speaks for itself Both have their advantages and disadvantages and I leave that to another discussion, but in the end we opted for B with Austrian Airlines: the myAustrian Messenger Service was born. Interesting side note: The decision was made not to use the word bot in the name, because Austrian Airlines users aren’t accustomed to this term yet.Ok great, but how do we speak?So now that we clarified what to speak about and who is speaking, we arrived at the question: How do we speak? Most companies have a set of rules for their Corporate Design – but now we are talking text. So you need a “non-visual branding guideline”, which, in most cases, exceeds the guidelines in a Corporate Design handbook. And that is exactly where our partner ambuzzador comes in. They provided the domain specific knowledge for Austrian Airlines, which includes standard greetings like “Servus” or certain ways to communicate. This domain knowledge is always an important part of the personality of the bot. Because only the personality makes the experience something unique and hopefully outstanding.MVC <U+2260> ChatbotAfter clarifying all the personality and soft parts, we finally had the go for the hard parts – building the chatbot. But soon we realized that we had a major problem: A classic MVC (Model View Controller) structure of software projects doesn’t work! What is your controller? – You only have 1 view (the Messenger API so to say). It was really hard for us to press the structure of a bot into this excellent model of building software. So at some point we gave up and did what every developer does: Rethink everything! What we came up with is, IMHO, a clever system to structure big bot architecture: a lifecycle model. Only in a lifecycle model I have the possibility to hand over messages from different packages to another to facilitate a structured processing of the input to the output. The Austrian Airlines Bot therefore has 4 lifecycle modules:EnhanceUnderstandKnowledgeDecideEnhanceIn this first model we aim to correct and “enhance” – duh – the user message. We convert payloads to objects, emojis to a readable format etc. This is also where you correct spelling and grammar mistakes, or add additional context information for the next module.UnderstandIn the “understand” module we try to understand the user intent and extract entities we are working with. This is mainly done by the NLP/AI service api.ai, which was recently aquired by Google. We decided to go with api.ai because back then, when we did our market analysis, they were the ones we felt most comfortable with concerning the quality of their modeling (though they are expensive). In addition to this external service we had to work around a couple of glitches and specialties of the platform to correct and further customize the results with our own little NLP engine. This was necessary since a general AI/NLP provider can’t handle all the cases we wanted. Here is also the point in the software where we try to generate a first answer to the user.KnowledgeIn this module we aim to improve the result from the previous section even further – either by finding better answers in the knowledge base of Austrian or by simply enhancing the output by e.g. quick replies that are fed from the long term memory. The latter is especially powerful since it drastically increases customer satisfaction and speed. In this module we work a lot with different IBM Watson APIs (which are extremely powerful, #fanboy). Here we also decide whether the content should be enhanced with a web view (e.g. a date picker in a web view) or not.DecideNow that we have finished the lifecycle, it is time to decide. This module now looks at the different answers that the previous modules produced and tries to decide what the best way to present the information in the messenger platform is. Is it a carousel?, An image? Just an emoji? Or is text just fine? What you see in your message window is the outcome of this decision.We failed – happens – how do we recover?As mentioned in the beginning, it was clear that the bot wouldn’t be able handle 100% of all use cases. So it was important to define an exit case that would hand over to the excellent support staff of Austrian Airlines. This in turn creates a few problems with the bot dynamic. Since the bot would automatically answer to every message, we had to “silence” it in these situations. This, and waking it up again, are some of the finer processes that are crucial to ensure a good customer experience overall. SUMMARYOverall, we were really happy with the results of this short 3-month innovation sprint with Austrian Airlines and are incredibly excited about what’s to come. We recognize that the bot performance we deliver at the moment is not yet were we want it to be – but that is how innovation and early prototyping works. We are constantly improving the setup and the confidence the system produces and are currently seeing more than 1.5k messages daily. Side Note: Vienna the City of ChatbotsOne amazing side note here: Vienna’s Bot Community. We are very proud to be located right at the center of bot activity in Europe. The City of Vienna was voted the most livable city in the world 8 consecutive times and now we are proud to say that we – as a community of bot developers, designers, writers and product owners – are the capital of bots in Europe too. Our monthly meetup is probably the biggest meetup in Europe and events like the ChatBotConf clearly establish our position. We (TheVentury) are excited to also launch Europe’s first chatbot centered accelerator in Vienna. We hope to further foster sustainable growth for this technology in Vienna, the City of Bots and are inviting everyone to apply to our first batch that starts Feb 2017.

There is no turning back the clock. Social media and search platforms are part of the world we live in and potential clients now expect to be able to find local agents online.Learn why a good online presence is vital to the success of local agents today.People Look OnlineThere is no way around it. People are looking online to find their answers. Whether they want to know about available homes in their area, down payment options or get an idea of the local agents in their area, people are using online search engines, Facebook groups and forums to get the information they need. Potential clients may look at popular real estate sites or use social media to get insights on a topic. Agents need to brand themselves and provide valuable information online in order to attract the segment of the population using mobile phones and tablets during their research process.Showcase ExpertiseOne reason to develop an online presence is to provide current and potential clients with information. It is not only about sharing the latest listings. Buyers, sellers and investors have a number of questions that an agent may help with to help them avoid a headache. Becoming an authority and sharing valuable resources and information can help an agent grow their following, develop stronger relationships and attract new clients. When information is valuable it is likely to be shared to a viewer’s circle, which in turn may increase an agent’s potential reach.Not only can agents provide information but previous clients and colleagues can offer referrals and feedback about an agent and their services. This can help viewers understand the type of experience they may be able to expect from an agent. Having this information available online can help an agent differentiate themselves from other local agents. The customer experience is key and word-of-mouth referrals and online reviews provide agents with a steady source of new clients.An Ever Changing WorldFacebook can be counted on to continually make changes. Search engines do too. Google algorithms are constantly updated to make it easier for those searching to find the information that they need. Therefore, agents need to stay aware and keep their website and pages user-friendly. This may mean removing old code and reworking a site to make it faster to upload on a mobile device.Content may need to be tweaked to format correctly on different types of platforms as each has its own optimal preferences. Long form content may be more suitable on a platform such as LinkedIn. Pinterest and Instagram are geared to sharing and commenting on images. Videos do well on Facebook. Agents would do well to perform a website audit and run through their website’s functionality on a regular basis to stay on top of any issues that may develop with the latest changes or through a hosting platform. In addition, continue to deliver a steady stream of content on social media platforms to maintain and grow engagement.Take Control of Your PresenceThe best way for agents to target and attract new clients is to develop a functional and professional website. A well-designed site works as a calling card and should have the following key features:Easy Navigation;Functionality across devices;An attractive and logical layout;Easy-to-read text; andHigh-quality images.Many agents choose to work with a professional web designer to create and maintain their site. The use of directories and social networking websites can help agents expand their network and attract both other professionals and potential clients. Continue to learn about developing an online presence and how to best make use out of a professional website and social media networks and never be at a loss for clients.

"52","https://theventury.com/blog/outsider-perspective/","TheVentury","From An Intern’s Eyes: From the Valley to Vienna","This summer, I made the switch from working in the startup ecosystem of Silicon Valley to working with TheVentury as a student intern here in Vienna. As weeks go by, see what similar trends I’ve been able to find here: Silicon Valley to Vienna My name is Sean Moakley, I am a 20-year-old student at Santa Clara University, and I come from Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Like many university students, I don’t really know as much as I pretend to, but I can tell you one thing is certain: I want to work with entrepreneurs. Despite working with two (and onto my third) startups and living in Silicon Valley, I still can’t begin to understand what that really means.One thing has become crystal in my eyes, however: Founders are far more than enthusiastic programmers. They are some of the most amazing people you will ever meet.Endless hours of stress, ideas, breakthroughs, mistakes, and pitches. Mostly fueled by Philz coffee. You’d do anything for your startup, and you treat it like your child, because it is. According to Forbes, nine out of ten startups fail, and in a place like Silicon Valley, it’s as cutthroat as it gets. Founders dedicate their nights, their weekends, their very lives and souls to their work to even have a chance to be in that 10%. Why? Why push yourself to such limits when there’s virtually no chance you are starting “the next Uber of” your idea?Because everyone, like me, wants to be involved. From angels and VCs to naive students such as myself, we all want a piece, and we are all involved in the ecosystem. Working in Redwood City, CA last summer exposed me to more than a hundred startups all working out of one fully furnished ecosystem. Don’t imagine an Erlich Bachman-esque “I own 10% of that but you can stay here” situation; rather, we gave the space, the connections, the coaching, and sometimes the money that our companies needed to succeed. It was one nice big happy family.Once you left the building though, we had serious competitors. Every co-working space, incubator, and accelerator were constantly hunting for the brightest and best ideas and founders out there. And just like a team giving its tenth pitch to its tenth VC board, we all wanted an edge. Just being able to say that a Paypal or a Lyft or a Flexport worked out of your desk space, that you helped them reach where they are now, that you saw potential and invested before everyone else… it all creates an immense amount of pride and hype.This past summer, even as a lowly intern, I got to help these innovators I had come to admire. The time I spent among these entrepreneurs who spoke about their ideas like they would about a newborn child or their significant other, helped me realize the nearly unfathomable amount of passion and drive they have. Some of the most incredible people in Silicon Valley have names you’ve never heard before. And I was able to help connect startups with the mentors, investors, and corporate partners that they need to mold their idea into something great. It’s the ecosystem that developed stars of yesterday and today and is developing the stars of tomorrow–the picture of Silicon Valley.Yet it’s not just Silicon Valley, hallowed as it may be. People like this are all over the world.The end of the Summer came quickly, and soon enough I was on my way to Vienna, Austria for five months. World travel is another passion of mine; I’ve spent time volunteering in Central America, exploring in Italy, and studying in Australia, to name a few of my favorite experiences. While I’ll spend plenty of time traveling and exposing myself to new cultures, I want to be immersed in the startup culture here more than anything.And so I find myself interning here with TheVentury, eager to find that passion, desire, and drive in a new environment. A host of questions immediately come to my mind: What innovation is there to find in this cultural melting pot of a city, the most dense and diverse in an unbelievably stunning and mountainous country? What is all the rage in Vienna? Does Fintech, VR/AR, Sustainability, Chatbot, or AI receive the majority of funding? How profitable is a “successful” startup here? Exactly how much venture funding is there to be found in Vienna? I’ve got homework to do.Over the next few weeks I’ll gather every bit of information I can about the startup ecosystem here in Austria. As Vienna is truly in the center of Europe, it’ll be interesting to learn how it functions as a melting pot of ideas. While the entrepreneurial environment here is certainly far smaller than in Berlin or London, I can also guarantee that this charming “town” of almost 2 million people has more than just a rich history: It has the right aspirations to help create the next big thing.","November 28, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chatbots-377x220.jpg"
"53","https://theventury.com/blog/pimptheoffice/","TheVentury","How we pimped our office in 24 hours","Do you sometimes sit at your desk and have moments of inspiration of possible ways to make your office cozier, friendlier and at the same time have a space that increases productivity?We did too and we decided to organize a FedEx day! Find out how exactly!FedEx Day at TheVenturyLast week we made it happen we changed our whole office with the help of a FedEx day and the manpower of the whole TheVentury team. FedEx stands for “Build and ship it in one day!” You have 24 hours to originate, develop, and deliver new products, new services, or a business process improvement. How? With a lot of energy, motivation, and pizza & beer.First step: The idea wallAs every innovative process is all about post it walls, every worker in the company, from intern to CEO, had the opportunity to come up with ideas and pin them. The great thing about these colourful walls is that you can easily cluster the ideas into different topics.What we wanted to change:rearrange tables the kitchen the meeting rooms the walls plants And of course, a sport and chill areaThe day we were all waiting forWe gathered around the office at 1:30 pm and started with taking a tour of inspiration. We went to have a look at the amazing mySugr office in the first district to get inspired. It was an awesome tour and experience. We then went back to the office where we were told how exactly we would pimp our office! Everyone had to choose one topic of interest which then formed a team. The result were mixed groups with people from different departments.After a short brainstorming session, the groups presented their ideas, received feedback and a budget of 500€. Luckily no one had the idea to spend it all on an ice cream machine (sorry guys, too late now).Let the fun begin!With a lot of enthusiasm and creative skills we pimped the office to match our companies core values. Which of course means the day ended with a night full of throwback music, free pizza and beers! Let us have a look at how we incorporated this initiative with our core values: EPIC!1. Entrepreneurial ThinkingEmbracing change is a key approach of TheVentury and this is why we decided to rearrange the space completely. Activity based working concept here we come! To make the offices more efficient, but also (and more importantly) inspiring, creative and innovative, we implemented our own version of David Dewane’s Eudaimonia Machine concept.We divided the space into different areas, allowing every employee to switch their work place setting according to his or her current needs. Some tasks are done better when you can work in a quiet corner, a creative brainstorming however would be more effective when done in a collaboration area and if someone needs to let off some steam, going to the “gym” and kicking the new punching bag might be the right call.2. PassionTo visualize how TheVentury drives innovation and progress we dedicated a wall to the team, showing a memory lane of events and achievements the company made over the last years. Another wall is devoted to our beloved clients with whom we share our enthusiasm and motivation. Now, they immediately see the purpose, intention and identity of TheVentury.3. ImpactWe love to create positive impact for the world but also for our team!Our workspace is like our home. We spend a significant amount of time of our lives in our office. This is why we had a whole team focusing only on plants. With the help of our new friends we are able to change the air quality in the office space. Did you know that plants have proved to alleviate stress? Taking care of the plants in between breaks can help you to deal with work-related stress. The presence of plants can reduce anxiety and even staring at plants can significantly reduce stress. As plants can uplift moods, employees are happier.4. Cooperation & EmpowermentLast but not least to visualize that our values are all about cooperation, we colored the hands of all the employees and let them form the letters E.P.I.C. on one of our office walls. One for all, all for one!To sum it up, our “pimp the office” idea worked out well because the employees were put in charge and were given full control over their areas. The team did not only meet the expectations but truly exceeded them. Sometimes, you just have to get your hands dirty, get started and trust that team work makes the dream work!If you want to know more about the “pimp the office” day and how the activity based working concept works, feel free to contact us at hello@theventury.com or simply come by for a cup of coffee! <U+0001F642>","August 14, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blue-and-yellow-graph-on-stock-market-monitor-159888-377x250.jpg"
"54","https://theventury.com/blog/pre-launch-mistakes/","TheVentury","3 mistakes you should avoid before launching a new product","At TheVentury, supporting sttartups is part of our DNA and we get to work with people launching new products on a daily basis. Even though, Customer Development & Lean Startup are not new concepts when it comes to launching a new product, we still see people making the same mistakes over and over again. Let’s have a look at the most common pitfalls, so you can prevent to tap into them: Mistake #1: Not testing your assumptionsSpending too much time on writing a business plan but not enough on testing the most critical assumptions.While business plans may nudge you to think about certain extremely crucial things, they can also create the false premise that it is a plan that can simply be executed and lead to success. As Steve Blank, the “father” of Customer Development said: no business plan survives the first contact with customers. He does not argue against business plans per se, but as long as you do not have a proven business model, there is no point in making a 5-year plan.It is more crucial to find a strategy to test and validate the most critical assumptions that underlie the new business idea. Testing ideas and failing quickly is much better than spending an immense amount of time and resources on a product that nobody wants. That’s why we recommend our customers to go through a customer discovery process, before jumping into the development of the product and way before launching a new product. Three steps to get started with customer discovery:Use the Value Proposition Canvas and the Lean Canvas (or the Business Model Canvas) to put your idea on paperNote down & prioritise the underlying assumptions of your ideaCreate a solid plan to validate the assumptions with experiments Mistake #2: Not talking to (potential) customersTo this day, we see a lot of people brainstorming and designing their product in a silo. This behaviour is based on the premise that we have a clear understanding of what our customers want and need. The reality is: there are no facts inside the building. If you haven’t talked to your customers, you probably don’t really understand their problems to the full extend yet. This is especially true when launching a new product, but even if you want to develop an internal tool, talking to your users will help you gain a much better understanding of their needs.Many people forget that they can actually talk to customers even if they don’t have a product yet. Using the right techniques, you can learn about their most important problems and start validating your idea. We have yet to find a person who didn’t think it was worth talking to customers after doing so. Sometimes people are amazed by how many valuable insights they are able to get just by having conversations. Three tips for good customer interviewsPrepare a guideline of questions before jumping into the interviewsDon’t pitch your idea, learn about your customers’ lives and problemsAsk about specific events that happened in their life, instead of opinions Mistake #3: Overblowing the initial productThe third mistake usually happens after the first steps of validating the idea. After talking to customers, you start sketching out countless features of the product in your head, all of which will make up the perfect solution for their problem. The more time you spend thinking about it, the more ideas you have, and soon enough you have planned out a full-blown product that is ready to be implemented, missing the fact that it is still not proven that the product will actually take off and be accepted by your customers.Let’s take a step back and take a look at the definition of a minimum viable product (MVP). Eric Ries defines the MVP as “that version of a product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least effort”. Keeping this definition in mind, there are a lot of things that can be done to gather insights before jumping into development at all, but even when you are ready to launch an end-to-end MVP, it is important to carefully think about what assumptions should be tested first and how to deliver value to your customer. Three essential tips for scoping your initial productUnderstand your customers well enough to understand which feature will offer the most value to themScope your minimum viable product with the assumptions of your business model in mind and think about what you are trying to learnLaunch with few features only, start analysing results and only add more features subsequently So sum it up, avoid making these mistakes!If you are planning to launch a new product, prepare yourself to not make these most common mistakes. Think about your business model and become aware of the underlying assumptions. Talk to your customers before actually developing the product to start learning early in the process. When you are ready to build a minimum viable product, don’t blow up the scope, instead, build a product that allows you to validate your value hypothesis as fast as possible and iterate from there.If you need any support in this phase of your innovation journey, don’t hesitate to reach out to us!

"55","https://theventury.com/blog/real-estate-chatbot/","TheVentury","What is a Real Estate Chatbot?","What can a chatbot help with in the real estate industry? Time to ask the person who knows best: Jatinder Singh, CEO of Botplan.io. Botplan is one of our startups currently participating in ELEVATE Batch #2 and develops chatbots for the real estate industry. What for exactly and why it is different from other chatbots, he explains it all. CONVERSATIONS:The central goal of a Chatbot is to have conversations with human beings in natural language. While human beings can have conversations with each other on limitless topics, Chatbots, on the other hand, can engage in only a narrow set of topics. Although Chatbots cannot address unlimited topics, they do offer other benefits over human beings such as 24×7 availability, concurrent conversations with hundreds of customers without any delay, and the high speed and accuracy in which information can be shared with customers. The biggest advantage of a chatbot is that it allows businesses to build a relationships with potential customers through a casual conversation.PLATFORMS:Chatbots work on various messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Kik, Telegram, and Slack. Chatbots also work on SMS and on customized Web chat widgets. Why is it relevant for chatbots to be available on these channels? Because that is where your customers are. 91% of online time spent is on Messenger services. Top 4 messenger services have now taken over the top 4 social platforms in terms of customer engagement. Another important element of chatbots is that unlike mobile apps, customers do not need to download a chatbot to engage with it. Customers simply look up a chatbot, in the same way they would look up a friend on a messenger service, and start messaging or texting. This aspect allows Chatbot to be accessible by millions of customers instantaneously.DOMAIN:As mentioned during the Conversations topic; chatbots can engage in a limited number of topics. A chatbot must be “schooled” on a specific set of topics. A chatbot schooled on various Real Estate topics becomes a Real Estate Chatbot. A Real Estate Chatbot would understand that a Rambler, Townhome, or Condo is a type of residential building. It would also understand what a customer wants to accomplish when they say “schedule a showing” or “I need mortgage pre approval.” This domain knowledge allows the Real Estate Chatbot to provide relevant information back to the customer and take actions in accordance with customer needs.USE CASES:The big “so what” of the Real Estate Chatbot technology is what it can allow the Real Estate Agents to accomplish. It can handle a variety of tasks that allows the Real Estate Agent to spend more of their time closing homes and building a network in their communities, while delegating “busy work” to the Real Estate Chatbot. Chatbots can be especially productive in helping sort out leads that are ready to move forward compared to those that are just curious. Here are a few examples of what a Real Estate Chatbot could accomplish:Understand a customer’s needs – looking to buy or sellAnswer customer generic questions regarding selling or buying a homeCapture customer contact information and send the lead to the CRM systemSet up showings for interested buyersSchedule meetings between Agent and a new buyer or sellerOffer services such as mortgage pre-approvalsConnect Facebook Ads to Facebook Chatbot to drive engagement and generate leads Conclusion:Real Estate Chatbots leverage state of the art technology that allows them to engage customers in a conversation on a platform of customer’s choice. Their speed, scalability, and 24×7 availability makes Chatbots an ideal tool for customer engagement. As a Virtual Receptionist, Chatbots can answer customer questions and convert those conversations into leads for the Real Estate Agent.To learn more about Botplan’s Real Estate Chatbot, please contact them at info@botplan.io.

Together with STARTPLATZ we are striving to boost local and international entrepreneurship, support our startups with an even stronger network and endless possibilities. To learn a bit more about STARTPLATZ, their experiences and know-how, we talked to Carolin Gattermann from the STARTPLATZ team.Carolin, the STARTPLATZ accelerator is starting its 15th Batch soon and is represented in two locations, Cologne and Düsseldorf. That’s quite a lot of experience you’ve accumulated over time and lots of startups and ideas you’ve seen. What are your key learnings from these past years?1) Founding is not for everyone. There are quite a few founders who underestimate the amount of time, passion and endurance you need for building a successful startup of just an idea. It’s not all coffee and table football, it’s (also <U+0001F609> ) very hard work!2) It is extremely hard to find founding in a very early stage, the phase where you work on idea validation and a proper problem solution fit. Business Angels or VCs normally start investing when there’s positive feedback from the market, which, as we observed during these last 14 batches, most likely happens after six to nine months. Our program helps bridging that gap and getting to that market fit earlier and better prepared.3) The right team is one of the most important factors for success, oftentimes more important than the idea itself. Try to gather an interdisciplinary team with different competences so that you can cover most of the tasks in the beginning internally (coding, strategy, sales,…).Since you’ve seen it all – or at least a lot: what was the craziest idea you’ve seen succeed?trackle is probably one of those. It is a temperature sensor (wearable) and App for family planning. The trackle sensor is worn in the vagina. It measures the body core temperature continuously overnight and sends the data to the App. In the meantime, they appeared on TV, won the Rheinland-Pitch and started a cooperation with Microsoft.What are you looking for in startups?We are searching for ambitious entrepreneurs, who love their product and intention, which is growing fast and who want to develop a sustainable business model.

"57","https://theventury.com/blog/startup-trends/","TheVentury","Exploring Trends in Austria’s Startup Ecosystem","The Second post of the blog-series by TheVentury Intern Sean Moakley, comparing his time working for Startups in Silicon Valley & Vienna.The best insight into any market today will be the trends driving it. For startups, it’s all about seeing how smaller niche trends interact in the larger realm of a service- and technology-based economy. What trends are hiding in the Vienna ecosystem? I’ve always found it interesting how trends come and go, at least the ones in my short life. When I was little, everyone moved from their CD players to iPods—I still remember the first time I saw an iPod commercial. Then there was AIM, and even kids like me started getting cell phones. Later, with the continued explosion of social media, I was able to watch from the screen of my iPhone as Vine was born, lived its glorious life, and died quietly.At least that’s how I saw it grow, from when I was a little kid with some technology to now, when I’m a slightly bigger kid with more technology.The trends here in Vienna—even the smallest ones—will provide the clearest window for me to look through. Where were startups in Vienna five years ago, and where are they going now? Top news on Silicon Valley trends will range from what Elon Musk is doing with his sustainable self-driving cars this hour relative to last, which AI is going to revolutionize AI, who the newest YouTube star is, or what the latest VR gadget is.VC firms will devote most of their research and resources to certain trends, working to catch them before they get too big. I figure if I can track what the “big dogs” are themselves tracking here, I’ll be able to better understand the up and coming local trends.Lucky for me, the venture capital space in Vienna is bigger than ever. I’ll have plenty of resources and examples to follow to really see what’s a hit behind the scenes at the moment. To get a really good grip on what they’re doing, I’ll have to reach out and speak with them myself.For now, I’ll have a look at how the numbers are moving for each startup—who’s getting involved, and why?Initial research shows a lot of similar characteristics to the startup world that I have been exposed to. The 2016 European Startup Monitor reveals that Austrian founders average 30.8 years old, 67.8% are Austrian citizens, and the initial company consists of 2.34 workers. The age range is similar, as most founders in Silicon Valley are between 22-30 years old, while around a quarter are in their thirties and forties.So there were a lot of numbers I just threw right in your face. What do they all mean?Perhaps in Vienna many prefer to gain more experience before devoting themselves wholly to the idea they came up with in their mom’s garage. At conception, a startup will typically be less than five employees, so no surprises here that the number may be a little bit smaller. There are simply fewer working resources available in a city with roughly 2 million inhabitants compared to almost 8 million in the Bay Area. This does not mean they are the same (surprise!). It means they are similar.AustrianStartups Stammtisch – a monthly event where the startup scene in Austria gathers (Photo courtesy of AustrianStartups)However, the best experience you can have in the startup world is working for more startups. Failure, despite the pain, teaches so much. Most startups fail, but your second time around, you know a lot about what’s coming. How many entrepreneurs in Vienna have done it before and want to do it again?It seems that many do. The most telling statistic in my eyes is this: More than 40% of founders in the area had already started one other company in the past, and 17% had started more than one. Further, when Vienna-based founders were asked what they would do if they failed, six out of every ten claimed they would start another company while a further two would at least work as employees of other startups.Yes, that is underlined, bolded, and italicized.This is common all over the world, it seems. Because despite the sleepless nights and years of dedication often resulting in failure, their drive is such that it won’t let them quit until they succeed. To some, it’s called second startup syndrome. It’s like every founder is Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali with a laptop rather than a ball or gloves. Their ideas are their addiction.These are the right footsteps, following closely behind those of the big guys across the ocean.What about other trends? Small numerical movements only scratch the surface. Who are the founders, and where do they usually come from? How often are they funded? And what advantages do they seek in the Austrian market? That and more coming next. ","December 5, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo-1556157382-4e063bb26661-1-377x220.jpg"
"58","https://theventury.com/blog/success-stories-batch-1/","TheVentury","Accelerator Success Stories Batch #1","Last week, we had our 4 ELEVATE chatbot teams pitch in front of 100+ VCs and business angels as part of our accelerator program. Why? Because we believe in the team members, their concept and their business spirit. As proud (bot) parents usually do, we also want to show off our kids. That’s why we decided to share the success stories of our 4 amazing teams with you. They started off with a prototype – after 6 months, things look a bit different: Toni The idea behind Toni arose last year for the European Football Championship 2016 when Klemens built the first prototype. During ELEVATE, the team decided to expand the business model to Toni.ai – a platform for white-label sports chatbots. This also caught the attention of LAOLA1.at – Austria’s biggest sports portal. After some meetings, Toni.ai was able to happily announce their new partnership! Toni.ai now powers the new LAOLA1.at chatbot, which has an impressive 30% retention rate after two weeks, with the average user opening ten articles per day. Toni.ai was further able to attract LAOLA1.at and Sportradar as content partner, therewith gaining access to massive amounts of highly relevant sports data. After successfully launching their proof of concept, they are eager to work with sports clubs as B2B customers. IconicBot IconicBot is a chatbot that bridges the gap between celebrity icons and their fans. Vishakha and Sandesh flew in all the way from India to participate in the ELEVATE meetups. They started off building their first chatbot for Vishakha herself as she is a famous actress and film producer in India with a fanbase of more than 1 Million users. After a successful launch, IconicBot already was able to win their first paying customer – Sri Thenandal Studios Ltd, a big film production company in India. IconicBot designed an AI-based chatbot to promote ‚Mersal’, which is considered one of the most-awaited films of 2017 in India. Combined with their two independent celebrity bots, IconicBot gained access to more than 9 Million Facebook users. Their bots processed already almost 1.7 Million messages. Vishakha was also accepted to the ‚She Leads Tech’ Initiative of Facebook and FB start, which further increases their network of business partners. Their next steps are to reach out to more celebrities and the big film & media houses. Selly Selly sells the stuff you no longer need. Despite being only 20 years old, Viktor and Vincent know how to do business. Besides ELEVATE, they were accepted for the LMU Lab, an incubator program in Munich that counts success cases such as Foodora and Flixbus as their alumni. Viktor and Vincent launched their bot Selly during the Demo Day. They used Viral Loops to already create a waiting list for interested people until their bot was ready to take orders. Users were able to move up the waiting list for each friend they invited. People were so eager to use Selly that over 25% of people shared it with their friends and the waiting list was filled with more than 230 potential orders after 3 weeks. They now focus on converting these numbers to orders and are currently in talks with several investors. Jingle Jingle, now consisting of Luke, Greg and Kevin, made it their goal to re-invent local shopping. The company came to life in August 2016 and as with most start-ups, Jingle had its ups and downs. However, through participating in incubation programs such as the WKO rocket science academy and as a team at the INiTS start-up camp, Jingle showed continuous progress. During their time at ELEVATE, Luke and Greg found their perfect fit with Kevin and hired him as CTO. At the Demo Day, they were able to convince the crowd and were awarded the ‘community award’ for the best pitch. This further encouraged talks with potential investors & partners. Luke, Greg & Kevin also received an invitation to share their knowledge and hold a keynote for the Handelsverband Österreich. Many people and retailers have expressed their interest in working with Jingle, which will be their main focus point for the upcoming weeks. So what do you think? It’s a pretty great bot family we’ve been growing those past 6 months, right? We could not be prouder and cannot wait to see what their future holds! And now: on to Batch #2 – let’s see what the next 6 months will bring!","September 18, 2017","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8436_EAP_171123_TheVentury_Elevate-1-1-377x220.jpg"
"59","https://theventury.com/blog/tech-at-rise/","TheVentury","Robots, ML & MVP – Tech Insights from RISE’19","As part of our Asia blog-series, I would now like to focus on what I learnt at the RISE conference in Hong Kong from a tech-perspective.I have put together the top tech trends that were discussed at this enormous event, starting with giving you insights about the talks by UBER, Google, about Machine Learning and Robots:The MVP of Uber Eats (according to Uber)So, let’s say you work at Uber and your task is to prototype a new service (Spoiler: later called Uber eats), that should use existing Uber infrastructure to deliver food to your new customer target group.Easy, right? You commission 300 person days on IT services, build an entire app on the existing infrastructure, and launch it worldwide. ….. ah NOPE! What you do is you build an MVP to test your idea FIRST. But what people often forget is that an MVP needs to be a complete workable solution – often low tech, simple, but incorporates the essence of your service or product. And I think Uber, the high-tech, lots-of-money, rich IT resources company, did that perfectly. So here is what they focused on:They hired 3 rental cars with drivers in New York City and gave them mobile phones. Then they filled those rentals card’s trunks with premade Sandwiches. And the Hardware: done.Afterwards they launched a very simple landing page, with 1 call-to-action: “Order Sandwich now”. This button led to a primitive form where users can enter their address. No payment provider yet. All cash – keep it simple) and after submitting they would just pass on the request to the driver via SMS, who would deliver the sandwich and collect the money.Done.Super simple! Low tech! Quick to iterate on! But still incorporating the essence of the later full Uber Eats vision. Well done Uber.After that they of course had many more iteration, but this examples nicely demonstrates that am MVP can be very simple and low tech but still provide the necessary insights you need to iterate WITH your customers.The best explanation on MLSometimes new tech insights are not coming from a pure technical perspective but from explaining it better to your peers, so that there is a better and broader understanding of what is happening.Take Machine Learning as an example here. Complicated Matter. Lots of math. Quite revolutionary.So how would you explain it to a non-tech person?Cassie Kozyrkov (@quaesita) from Google has a brilliant approach – here is how it goes: In very traditional programming, we feed the computer with exact instructions, on what it should do. Do that calculation, run that program, sort that table. The computer would than “stupidly” execute those commands one-after-another and then output the result. That way of working has served us very well, and the results are very predictable. *But let’s say you now need to build a program that classifies images as whether there are cats or dogs in them.*except if you mess up the instruction, which is then called a bug <U+0001F600>Well, quite a challenge to formulate ALL the rules that make up the pixels to distinguish one from the other – you have to factor in form, structure, color and countless others.But wouldn’t it be nice to just show the computer some examples (!) and let the algorithm figure out all the instructions in the background – like “programming by example”, rather than by concrete instructions. Well that is basically what machine learning is.And it also explains nicely, why ML sometimes fails. Because it hasn’t learned some corner cases, and therefore was not able to factor in the instructions. In our example: if you feed it a tiger, but there was none in the training that classifies it as a “cat”, how should the algorithm know.Bringing it to that fitting abstraction level is quite a challenge, but now you have at least an explanation for machine learning.Robots, Robots everywhereAnother thing that struck me at RISE was the amounts of Robots that was presented and present. Truly the influence from cities like Shenzhen (see our blog about the Greater Bay Area) was clearly visible. Especially Robots for elderly and service tasks were prevailing. This is understandable especially in an aging Asian society that is focused on service industry (in HK)Overall RISE Conf was an amazing experience for us. We were able to present us, our services and also our new product BotBase there and got a lot of encouraging but also critical feedback.Get in touch!Do you have any questions or are interested in our Machine Learning / AI Services?

"60","https://theventury.com/blog/topicmodeling/","TheVentury","Machine Learning Prague 2019 – Topic Modeling","Two weeks ago we attended the “Practical conference about ML, AI & Deep Learning applications” – Machine Learning Prague 2019 from February 22nd – 24th, 2019. We had a great time at the conference and were truly able to deepen our knowledge in the field of ML. Two of our most relevant areas of ML that we would like to cover are “Topic Modeling” (in this post) and “Anomaly Detection” in the second part (coming soon). Let’s get started!Topic Modeling with Machine Learning We heard about a large variety of interesting applications of Machine Learning. We heard a very interesting talk from Alexander Loosley at Data Reply called “Solving the Text Labeling Challenge with EnsembleLDA and Active Learning”. He discussed how to effectively identify and label topics within a huge corpus of text. We are interested in this topic at TheVentury because it has a wide variety of potential applications and it builds from our experience in Natural Language Processing. Discovering topics in social media posts One of the great things you can do through topic modeling would be to summarize what customers are saying through social media and automatically discover the most important message topics. This can guide you to address the most relevant issues for your customers and can also flag critical messages as they come in. In the presentation Alexander discussed the EnsembleLDA method to robustly identify topics. LDA stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is a Machine Learning method commonly used to cluster data by topics. EnsembleLDA is the procedure by which LDA is repeated multiple times with different random starting points so that the most robust topics can be identified. This method gives confidence in the topic labels so that they can be used in analysis or other business applications.Discovering topics in emails Topic Modeling can also be used to categorize and label emails. For example, important information is contained in the many emails that are sent and received about a project or the company. By using Machine Learning, emails are categorized by their major topics, and can be further categorized into smaller topics. This allows you to categorize, explore, and summarize the relevant information in the emails. Super useful!Using Topics to sort and search documentation Another application for Topic Modeling is to categorize internal documentation. If you or your employees spend significant time searching through internal documentation, you can greatly improve this experience using Machine Learning. We can make it easy to quickly find the correct document through keyword searches based on topics.Visualization With any of these applications, it is important to be able to visualize and explore the data and topics. Alexander showed some interesting visualization methods which help to understand the data, improve the methodologies, and produce the most accurate topic models. It was a highly engaging and interesting talk! Thanks again Alexander!Next upIn my next blog post we will be discussing “Anomaly Detection” which was also widely discussed at the #mlprague! The general idea is to use past data to decide if new data are conforming or anomalous. Watch out for it! Does Topic Modeling sound like something your business could benefit from?We are happy to have a talk about possible solutions that meet your needs.Let’s talk: maximilian.unger@theventury.com","March 5, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190809_110457-3-1024x782-377x220.jpg"

Was the site appealing, easy to navigate, easy on the eyes?If not, this might have been due to underdeveloped User Interface and User Design – Luckily the ones of our ELEVATE teams are great. Thanks to Natalie Korotaeva. The importance of user interface and user experience Natalie is the expert who recently taught our accelerator batch about User Interface Design and creating an appealing Customer Experience. And despite her being modest and (rightfully) stating that each and every workshop topic is essential in its own right, the importance of UI/UX must not be underestimated.After all, lots of startups could succeed in their endeavours – if they just improved their User Interface. Be it redesigning the user on-boarding process or making your Call-To-Action more appealing – these things can radically change your conversion and retention rates. But why is that? The struggles of entering a crowded marketIf you create a new product in an existing market you need to make it ten times better than other current ones.Launching a product in a crowded market is hard, but it is not impossible. Examples for some apps or platforms that managed to be successful in these circumstances are Revolut and N26. Why? Because they have user-friendly interfaces, are modern, appealing and well designed (besides their technological and product innovations). The UI trendAnd it’s time to get on the train now – the industry is constantly developing. Natalie sees the trend of UI & UX going greatly towards voice interfaces, which will also create some challenges. How do you create an interface without having an actual, visual screen? How to handle errors? How do you do A/B-testing to understand whether the user is satisfied with their experience?These are problems and challenges that will need to be tackled sooner rather than later. TheVentury is actively working on them, be it in our everyday work with conversational interfacing or with ELEVATE: Batch’s 3 team Espresso Labs is focusing on non-visual voice interfaces in the hospitality industry for example – things are moving forward fast. Tips & tricks for prospective UI designersTo get started, Natalie has the following recommendations for tools and resources.Figma for designing digital screens and providing first visual insights.To design digital products, she highly recommends FramerAnd if you are completely new to the topic, she recommends starting with this book Lastly, Natalie gave us a valuable tip to redirect to entrepreneurs and UI designers, neatly packing it into her favourite quote from the movie “The Founder”:“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” So, stay persistent! ","February 12, 2019","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190710_220241-1024x768-377x220.jpg"

It’s going to be a bumpy night.”Originating from 1950s “All about Eve”, this is the quote Pooja Ahluwalia chose to describe her startup-mentality. Out of context this might have sounded weird, but these words are coming from someone that loves working with startups.“More than anything what excites me most is to see the commitment and love they have for building something unique and innovative.”This mentality of not only sharing knowledge but also learning so much about the industries and their respective challenges is what made Pooja a vital part of Vienna’s startup community: She works as a Growth Marketer at TheVentury, Mentor for TheGrowthbase as well as a lecturer at FH St.Pölten. Now she recently helped our ELEVATE teams with solving a really important problem:Who is your customer?Following Valentina’s workshop on “What problem is being solved” Pooja asked our teams a significant question: “Whose problem is being solved?”. Clearly identifiy and articulate your User Personas. If you don’t know whom the product is tailored for, how do you know who to ask for feedback? How do you know who to target in your marketing efforts?That’s why Pooja’s workshop was centered around creating specific user personas: Exemplary customers to represent and visualise their challenges. What problem do they need solving, what is their motivation? How would they get to know your company? What values do they associate with? Pooja helped the teams with creating two personas each, even going as far as naming them and finding a representative look.Without understanding why a specific user would use your product, you will not be able to approach the right people.Pooja’s “secret” tipHer number one tip to give to startups is to not start working on marketing once you think your product is ready. Instead seek feedback and validation through all channels – Always involve your customer in product development. And, of course:Stick to the lean approach – work with hypothesis driven tests from day one. ","November 9, 2018","https://theventury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/digital-marketing-377x220.jpg"
"63","https://theventury.com/blog/utm-tracking/","TheVentury","What is UTM tracking and why you desperately need it","One of the most amazing things of current digital marketing campaigns is the ability to instantly cluster and segment your incoming users. If let’s say your grandfather or -mother, or even your parents had a business back in the day, they also relied on advertisement. However, they did not have the ability to instantly see, if their campaign was successful or not and had no way to adapt the campaign on the fly – like with UTM tracking nowadays.In this day and age however you can easily see how much a click costs, how much a lead costs, what you spent to make that one sale – if you choose to implement UTM codes. If you don’t do it, well then you should not even put “Basic knowledge in digital marketing” in your resume.What is a UTM code and why will it help me?UTM Codes are added to a URL to make the traffic from sources visible. They will not alter the destination of the URL, it only adds more information for either Google Analytics or other analytic tools.URL without UTM code: “https://www.theventury.com” (tells you nothing about the traffic source)URL with UTM: “https://www.theventury.com?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=lead_acquisition_nov16” (tells me in Google Analytics, that the traffic is from Facebook, from our TheVentury page, and the goal of the post was to generate leads in November 2016)So you say it’s to much work to do it? You don’t want to burden yourself with yet another task? Think again! The UTM Tracking will help you to easily segment your incoming traffic and furthermore to identify and compare potential funnels you want to invest time and money into! It will have a major impact on your ROI calculation.Available UTM codes:UTM_sourcewill be used for defining the platform/page you posted (e.g.: facebook / linkedin / hackernewsUTM_medium will be used for defining the subpage where it was posted (eg.: for Facebook the group/page ID // for linkedin the group ID…)UTM_campaign will be used for defining if it was a paid ad (paid), a manuell posting (man)…UTM_content can be used to add further information (if campaign=man then we can define who posted)UTM_term (not often used) e.g. a keywordHow to built your own URLs for campaigns or social media activities with Google URL BuilderThere are different ways to build your own UTM codes for your URLs – for the beginning you can use Google’s URL Builder Tool – which is quite nice if you just have a few URLs now and then to generate.I have pre-filled the fields we would use for a link in our newsletter about growth hacking.As you can see, you just need to copy paste the URL that the builder is spitting out and of you go.

The Human Voice is the most perfect instrument of all. – Arvo PärtWe think that voice is not only the most perfect instrument, but also the future to meaningful brand interaction.Conversational interfaces, or chatbots, already make it possible to have quality voice conversations between businesses and customers today. We expect this trend to rise much further. Why?Request by voice assitants are going to tripleVoice assistants are the fastest-growing connected device category in history, as researched by Deloitte.According to a recent forecast from Juniper Research, the use of voice assistants is expected to triple over the next few years:About 8 billion voice assistants will be in use by 2023 – compared to 2.5 billion as of end 2018. Most of these will be Siri or Google Assistant, based on smartphones.Google Assistant is expected to reach 1 billion devices (as of January 2019)Amazon´s Alexa has reached 100 million devices (December 2018)Apple HomePod grew at 45% and sold 1.6 million units in the fourth quarter of 2018Thus, voice commerce will grow immensely – and is expected to reach $80 billion per year by 2023.One good example for this is Expedia: The digital travel agency already created browse and book capabilities using google assistant last fall.Research author James Moar explains “connected TVs and smart displays [will be] vital here, as they can provide a visual context that is lacking in smart speakers.”To give you a better understanding of the positive signs in voice technology, we collected four broader signs which stand for a bright future. 4 Signs for a bright future for voiceNew EntrantsGoogle, Amazon, Apple – Wasn´t there another big… Oh yes, Samsung! The Bixby-powered Galaxy Home speaker will arrive on the market by April 2019. We hereby declare the battle for market shares. Interesting times ahead!Things are being built, measured, learnedBuild, measure, learn – that´s just the way innovation goes. The impact of time, scale and consumer trust on product progress should not be underestimated. More data and more user engagement will fuel Natural Language Processing technologies, just as increased search queries aided Google’s search. Just recently it has been announced that millions of Alexa interactions are currently being tapped and analyzed to decrease NLP error rates by 8% and thus advance the quality of voice interfaces. While voice technologies are improving at a pace, the experiences of today will only increase. The fact that voice devices are being adopted by more and more consumers leads to trust in the channel – and we will be able to do much more with voice than we can think of now.Multi-Channel Magic“The innovation is natural language processing, not smart speakers or chatbots” Charles Cadbury (2018). The real magic happens when conversations go cross-platform, thus voice should not be seen as an interface that will forever replace screens in the long run, but rather as a precious addition to the conversation landscape.ReferencesThe more the success stories, the more companies will follow by investing in an innovation. Often innovation practitioners struggle with getting budget for an early exploration of burgeoning technology. Once brands realise they have to catch up with the ecosystem, those already engaged will be at the front foot.With the rise of multi-platform assistants, the use of standalone apps is expected to decline. That makes a lot of sense considering how seamless interactions with brands can become if they take place on text and voice assistants, powered by multi-channel enterprise platforms. While voice is advancing, make sure to get your business ready by setting up multi-channel communication opportunities with your customer.

In the following blog I will share my learnings on automating communication through bots.Web Summit 2019, Lisbon, Portugal Web Summit is the world’s largest tech conference, where 75.000 people from all around the world come together to connect, network and most importantly get inspired!One of the first observations I made was that most participants fit into one of the following 2 categories:The “I’m here on a mission and got my to-do list ready” typeThe “let’s see what this is all about” typeMy personal approach was to find a good balance between the two!I invested 2 days talking to a variety of different people with the clear goal to understand their struggles and pain points related to the automation of communication flows. Our aim was to understand how we can help them automate communication through bots!On the third day, we represented BotBase at our own booth.How AI will disrupt every aspect of communicationAfter listening to many talks by industry experts and talking to some highly driven individuals, I have put together my top 3 most important conclusions on the topic of AI and communication.1. AI will disrupt how business communicateWe all have experienced at least one of those chatbots on websites or Facebook-Pages, right? As great as the idea sounds, many conversational interfaces from the last years could not live up to user expectations. Instead of providing value to customers, they often left them irritated. For this reason, many managers I spoke to associated buzzwords like “Chatbot” with negative experiences.However, through leveraging AI it is now possible to build a new generation of intelligent bots that can really understand user needs through applying Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques. When combining an in-depth understanding of users desires with integrated access to enterprise data sources, bots are empowered to provide intelligent and very bespoke answers. This obviously leads to a high level of customer satisfaction as a consequence. This new opportunity opens doors to automate many communication flows that up until now needed to be done by humans.It will affect how businesses and brands communicate with their customers. In the same way it will revolutionize how internal communication processes within large enterprises will evolve.2. New enterprise solutions are needed to build outstanding conversational experiencesMost communications experts argue that the way we currently interact on digital channels is very badly aligned with natural human behavior. Most businesses still communicate entirely one-directional to customers by putting content on their company website or running marketing email campaigns.WHY is it like this? – Well… here is what people at Web Summit 2019 told me: It is way simpler for them. And for most of them it worked pretty fine until now. On the other side, efforts to implement conversational interfaces have caused a lot of pain.In the past the tools available to automate communication, especially towards customers, have either not convinced business decision makers yet or failed to meet their expectations. Although this still holds true today, many of them admitted that they are open to testing new approaches that promote more bi-directional communication. The trend will definitely go in this direction and the solution that will hit the most relevant pain points best has a huge potential to gain significant attention in the enterprise segment. Many people from functional departments like Customer Support, Marketing or Human Resources explicitly mentioned that they would actually prefer having easy-to-use tools at hand that help them in creating and managing conversational interfaces.I felt their deep desire to move fast and constantly monitor interactions of external or internal users with their intelligent bots to keep making them smarter. All within their specialized departments without much dependency on IT departments.3. Intelligent bot solutions require continuous optimisationOne misconception I could spot on many people’s mind was related to how conversational interfaces should be managed. A fundamental reason why most implemented solutions are not successful in a sustainable way is that the constant need for adaptation is not considered. It was specifically interesting to hear from Felipe, a representative of a small south-american bank, that exactly the lack of continuous advancement of their bot solution was the key reason why their project was had to be stopped at last. A “build once – use forever” mentality doesn’t work with bots.This is because the way we communicate as well as the channels we use are undergoing constant change. When companies conduct one-time projects to automate internal communication or part of their communication with customers, this frequently causes problems. Companies need to maintain the possibility of constantly adapting these interfaces.Specifically in an agile organization the requirement to respond flexibly and fast to changing user behavior is key. This comes with the need to optimize automated communication flows based on real-time analytics.AI is only as good as the data it is trained on. User interactions provide new training data on an ongoing basis.To summarize…Communication is at the heart of success in any business and yet I’m still convinced that it is an undervalued topic by many business owners. A vast majority of people I talked to agreed that the trend goes increasingly towards conversational communication flows. Most of them mentioned that they are currently open to take steps in this direction.It was great to see peoples’ huge interest in BotBase, our own solution to automate enterprise workflows and communication. We are currently working very hard on advancing our enterprise solution.The great enthusiasm in our approach in providing an all-in-one platform for building, monitoring and optimizing intelligent bots and receiving constant valuable feedback from our clients is proving that we are on the right track.

It’s safe to say that we couldn’t be more excited about it!January 24th kicked off what will be a fantastic bot year – and it’s great to see that the interest in chatbots and conversational interfaces has only gotten greater. Vienna once again proved to show that it is still one of the biggest bot hubs in the world!In a whirlwind of a night, Greg Leuch shared some secrets of Poncho and how it became the world’s favorite bot, Prashant Pitti talked about NearGroup’s unconventional growth hacks and Susann Fischer & Markus Brunner gave insights into discovery & possibilities of bots on Facebook Messenger. Thanks to all of them for flying all the way to Vienna from NYC, Delhi, Dublin and London and for making it a night worthwhile.Our Key Learnings:Obviously, we don’t want to withhold all these insights from you. So without further ado, here are our 4 Key Learnings from “World of Chatbots – The Grand Meetup”:Markus Brunner, Facebook Messenger: “How do we build chat experiences that people will love?” was the main theme here. Markus a couple of tips on that: “Start small, dream big” – Just get started and try with a basic use case. Build it up from there.“Be honest, don’t pretend” – Don’t pretend not to be a bot. Be honest and educate your users about the limitations of your bot.“Learn and improve continuously” – Keep learning from user feedback. Check conversations, learn where users get stuck and improve your bot constantly.Greg Leuch, Poncho“Build emotional connections with your users”If there is one thing we can learn from Poncho, it is how to build conversational experiences users can relate to and have fun with. Through adding little comments here and there Poncho is giving users a glimpse of his life, making him a character with a history like you and me. Susann Fischer, Facebook“Really think about how the welcome screen resonates with your service and how you can use a little bit of text to get people excited to get started. ” We all know how hard it can be to keep it short and interesting at the same time. But Susann really stressed the fact that you only get one shot to make a good first impression. So make it count and use the welcome screen wisely.Prashant Pitti, NearGroup“Ask your users what they want” So simple, so obvious – yet, how many of us actually apply it? This tip continues to work out very well for NearGroup, as the team doesn’t have to worry about what feature to launch next – their users will tell them. It also makes users more excited about the product, as they feel valued and have a say in what happens next. Definitely a tip to keep in mind for your next feature-implementation.Next chance: Demo DayIn case you missed it: you can find the photos of our event here. Your next chance to attend one of our bot events will be our ELEVATE Demo Day on May 23rd – definitely make sure to save the date!Thanks to all of you for your interest, for coming and for staying for a beer or two afterwards – we hope you had just as much fun as we did and can’t wait to see you all again soon at our Demo Day!Psssst: If you found your passion for conversational interfaces, machine learning or growth hacking at our event – or if you’ve always been passionate about it – we are currently hiring.
