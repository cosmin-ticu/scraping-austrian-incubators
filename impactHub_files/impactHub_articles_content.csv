Die Eltern vielleicht sogar öfters. Zarte Annäherungen an das Mysterium Internet. Wenn Emails sich nicht öffnen lassen oder Googles erste 10 Treffer nicht das gewünschte Ergebnis liefert, ist der Griff zum Handy nicht mehr weit und der Sohn oder die Tochter muss einspringen. In langsamen Schritten nähern sich ältere Menschen dem Internet und Mobile Devices an. Am Willen und Eifer das WWW zu entdecken fehlt es nicht. Wie kann man denn sonst mit seinem Enkerl oder Kind kommunizieren, die nie Zeit haben? Während die Jugend spielerisch mit elektronischen Medien hantiert, ist es für die ältere Generation in etwa so, als würden sie Chinesisch lernen. Eine Brücke zwischen den Generationen Mit dem Startup qualitaetszeit.at gründeten Daniela Weinholtz und Kornelius Pesut 2013 ein Projekt um diesen Gap zwischen Alt und Jung zu verkleinern. Den Social Impact Award 2015 und ein Stipendium für den Social Impact Start (SIS) konnten die beiden als erste große Erfolge verbuchen. Erfahrung mit dem Thema können die beiden genug aufweisen. Waren sie doch Trainer beim “A1 Internet für alle Campus”. Dort hatten sie die Möglichkeit die Teilnehmer jeden Alters für die digitale Welt fit zu machen. Digital Coach als Jobchance für die jungen Digital Natives Die Gründer hatten noch einen weiteren Plan mit ihrem Projekt. Den Fokus nicht nur auf die ältere Generation setzen, sondern auch auf die Jugend war den beiden ebenfalls ein Anliegen. In 2-tägigen Workshops wollen Daniela und Kornelius jungen Interessierten zeigen, wie man die ältere Generation als “Digital Coach” in der elektronischen Welt unterstützten kann und dabei auch noch Geld verdient. Einzelcoachings mit Senioren sollen mit 25 bis 35 Euro vergütet werden. Der Workshop bietet Jugendlichen die Chance einen Job zu machen der ihnen leicht fällt. Gegen die derzeitige Orientierungslosigkeit bei der Jobsuche der jungen Menschen wird ebenfalls gesteuert. Derzeit laufen die Vorbereitungen für das Trainingskonzept der “Digital Coaches” auf Hochtouren. Das SIS als idealer Support Im Impact Hub Gespräch erzählten sie uns von ihren weiteren Plänen und den Erfolg des SIS-Awards: Daniela und Kornelius wollten loslegen, Macher sein. Mit der Bewerbung beim SIS wollten die Medienpädagogin Daniela und der Mediendesigner Kornelius ihr Projekt in die Welt loslasssen. Neben ihren normalen Jobs war der Plan viel Erfahrung mit Startups zu sammeln. Paysafecard konnte mittlerweile als Sponsoring-Partner gewonnen werden. Mit diesem starken Partner haben sie finanziellen Support gesichert und ein Netzwerk in Marketing und Buchhaltung aufgebaut. Mit den Nebenwirkungen eines SIS-Awards haben Daniela und Kornelius überhaupt nicht gerechnet. Ihr Baby qualitaetszeit.at muss laufend vor potenziellen Investoren und Jurys vorgetragen werden. Je mehr sie über ihr Projekt sprachen, desto mehr nahm sie Gestalt an. qualitaetszeit.at wurde dadurch greifbarer und realer. Am meisten treibt sie das “Dankeschön” ihrer Kunden an, gefolgt von einem “großen Lächeln” nach einer Coaching-Einheit, so die beiden SIS-Gewinner. Erfolge und Kooperationen garantiert Durch qualitaetszeit.at will das Medien-Duo nicht nur die digitale und gesellschaftliche Kluft zwischen alten und jungen Menschen verringern, sondern auch Jobs schaffen. Ihr Projekt bietet eine Vielfalt an Möglichkeiten und besitzt das Potenzial zu wachsen. Mit dem Eifer, den Daniela und Kornelius an den Tag legen werden zukünftige Partnerschaften wohl nicht mehr lange auf sich warten.","August 21, 2015","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/qz_Team-header-2-600x400.jpg"

The staff in the mental health institution had a difficult time with him. In the end he was released without a cure. In the same year he married an ex-prostitute and found some stability in his life and the love for his work. That man was the social scientist and philosopher Auguste Comte. He was a proponent of altruism – the philosophic approach of pursuing happiness through helping others. Do good and earn good.coins Christoph Hantschk and Philipp Wasshuber aren’t mentaly ill, but do follow Auguste Comte philosophic view. 2014 they founded bgood.at, a startup that engages social engagement and ecologial sustainability. Philipp, a teamleader of boyscouts and Christoph, an alumni in economics want to believe that small gestures can change the world in a good way. Be it that you avoid plasticbags or volunteer in institutions like Caritas. With their startup the two founders want to reward such tiny contributions. Lets say, Peter wants to teach young migrants his mother tongue German. For this commitment he receives points, so called good.coins. With enough good.coins he gets rewarded with a movieticket or free pass to a fitnesscenter. With their idea the two entrepreneurs won the Social Impact Award 2015 and got a stipend for the Social Impact Start. Pitching and spreading the word of bgood is their daily business. Companies show social and environmental commitment For both companies and bgood this project is a win-win situation. Christoph and Philipp’s business partners and companies get the chance to present their social and environmental engagement. The startup in return receives a small comission for bringing new customers to the companies. Christoph gathered already some startup experience. His previous project was heiligerstuhl.at. The seats of the former home stadium Rapid are redesigned and sold to real fans of the club. Some of the revenues are given to the support of the Rapid-Youth. Franchise in Australia The idea of bgood is scaling. An affiliate of bgood is planned in Melbourne, Australia. For the next stage of bgood the founders are raising 100.000 Euro to continue their ambitious ideas. A crowdfunding project is their pipeline and the search for investors is on the way. “Superpowers like Batman” In an Impact Hub Vienna Interview Christoph and Philipp talked about their project and the challenges of being in the SIS-Programm. 1) What were your expectations when applying for SIS?My expectation were to get feedback from people who have a lot of experience in big companies like SAP, get visibility for bgood and get to know interesting people. 2) What was the 1 most important thing you learned from being part of SIS? We got the chance (thanks to our great mentor Ruth for organizing this) to pitch our business solution to the CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer) from SAP. A meeting on this level was a great lesson and we learned a lot from it. 3) What is the project you are currently working on? bgood is the first platform that measures the social and environmental impact of individuals and rewards people for their actions. On bgood people find information what they can do. People can choose from over 100 different social and environmental tasks. For example avoiding a plastic bag by using reusable bags, saving co2 emissions by riding a bike instead of driving a car or even teaching a migrant child their mother tongue. Everybody who registers collects points (good.coins) for their actions. With these good.coins our users can buy cool rewards.4) How did the SIS award change your venture story?Winning the SIS award was great motivation boost for us.5) What was your most recent success moment? We recently were selected from over 350 european startups as one of the 16 finalists of the european innovation tournament held by the European Investment Bank. Beside that we won the Social Impact Award and entered the first round of the Innovate for Climate Challenge. Personally I am always happy when we reach an internal milestone. For example a few weeks ago our community reached the milestone that 5000 tasks have been completed on bgood. Now we are almost at 7000 and I cant wait for 10000! 6) What is an absolutely random fact about you that everybody should know? I am addicted to ice cream and can easily eat a big cup Ben and Jerrys without blinking. 7) What impact do you want to have in the next years? I want bgood to grow to 5 million users by 2020 to help people to decrease their ecological footprints and life their lives in a more sustainable way. 8) What super hero power would you like to have and why? I am a big batman fan and I love technology. Therefor I would love to have his power to create awesome technology that helps mankind.

Er hatte eine arrogante aber auch gewinnende Persönlichkeit. Die Ärzte in der Heilanstalt verzweifelten an diesem besonderen Patienten. Schließlich wurde er ohne Heilung entlassen. Im selben Jahr heiratete der Mann eine ehemalige Prostituierte und fand in seinem Leben wieder Stabilität und die Liebe zu seiner Arbeit. Die Rede ist vom Sozialwissenschafter und Philosoph Auguste Comte, dem Begründer des Altruismus. Dieser philosphischer Ansatz spricht vom Streben nach persönlichen Glück indem man Anderen hilft. Tu Gutes und verdiene good.coins Christoph Hantschk und Phillip Wasshuber haben keine psychischen Störungen, leben aber nach Comtes philosophischer Sicht. Mit bgood.at starteten die beiden 2014 ein Projekt, das auf Nachhaltigkeit und soziales Engagement baut. Phillip, ein ehrenamtlicher Pfadfinderleiter und Christoph ein VWL-Absolvent, sind überzeugt, dass man mit kleinen Taten die Welt verbessern kann. Sei es beim Einkauf auf die Plastiktüte verzichten oder sich ehrenamtlich bei der Caritas betätigen.. Um mit diesen kleinen Taten einen Beitrag zu für eine bessere Welt zu setzen, wollen die beiden Gründer solche Aktion belohnen. Würde Peter einem minderjährigen Flüchtling Deutschunterricht geben, kann er auf bgood.at seine gute Tat eintragen und Punkte bekommmen, so genannte good.coins. Hat Peter genug Punkte gesammelt kann er seine good.coins gegen einen Theaterbesuch oder Kinofilm eintauschen. Mit dieser Idee haben die beiden sozialen Entrepreneure den diesjährigen Social Impact Award gewonnen und sind im Programm des Social Impact Start aufgenommen worden. Ihr tägliches Business im SIS bedeutet pitchen und ihre Idee nach außen kommunizieren. Unternehmen zeigen ihr ökologisches und soziales Bewußtsein Für kooperierende Unternehmen und bgood.at bedeutet dieses Projekt eine Win-Win-Situation. Christoph und Philipp gewinnen Businesspartner und die Unternehmen bekommen die Chance ihr ökologisches und soziales Engagement zu zeigen. Namhafte Institutionen wie Caritas und Sonnentor sind schon an Bord. Die Finanzierung des Startups erfolgt über Provisionen mit den Partnerfirmen. Christoph Hantschk kann bereits einige Erfahrung mit Startup-Projekten vorweisen. Eine seiner früheren Ideen war heililgerstuhl.at. Stadionsitze aus dem ehemaligen Rapid-Stadion wurden an eingefleischte Fans als Designer-Möbel verkauft. Ein Teil des Gewinns ging an die Nachwuchsförderung des SK Rapid Wien. “Superkräfte wie Batman” Christoph und Philipp standen uns in einem Impact Hub Vienna Interview Rede und Antwort über ihr Projekt und die Herausforderungen im SIS-Programm. 1) Was waren eure Erwartungen nachdem ihr euch für das SIS beworben habt? Wir erhoffen viel Feedback von Leuten zu bekommen, die eine Menge Erfahrung in großen Firmen haben, wie z.B. SAP. Unsere Idee zu verbreiten und interessante Menschen kennenlernen. 2) Was war das Wichtigste das ihr im SIS gelernt habt? Durch unseren Mentor Ruth hatten wie die Chance den CSO-Chef (Chief Sustainability Officer) von SAP zu treffen und unsere Idee zu pitchen. Ein Meeting aus dem wir eine Menge Erfahrung sammeln konnten. 3) An was für einem Projekt arbeitet ihr im Moment? Bgood ist die erste Plattform die soziales und umweltfreundliches Engagement fördert und diese gleichzeitig belohnt. Auf bgood können Menschen erfahren was sie tun können um die Welt besser zu gestalten. Aus über 100 guten Taten kann man auswählen. Zum Beispiel beim Einkauf auf das Plastiksackkerl verzichten oder CO2 Emissionen sparen und mit dem Fahrrad in die Arbeit fahren. Ein gutes Beispiel ist es einem jungen Immigranten seine Muttersprache beibringen. Jeder der sich registriert kann good.coins sammeln und sie gegen coole Preise eintauschen. 4) Wie hat der SIS Award eurem Projekt geholfen? Der SIS Award war ein riesengroßer Motivationsschub für uns. 5) Was war euer letzter großer Erfolg? Wir waren unter den letzten 16 von 360 Startups beim European Innovation Tournament. Dieses Event wird von der European Investment Bank gesponsert. Parallel dazu haben wir den Social Impact Award gewonnen und sind in der ersten Runde des Innovate for Climate Challenge. Es freut mich immer, wenn wir einen Milestone erreichen. Vor einigen Wochen durchbrach unsere Community auf bgood die 5000 Task-Marke. Die 7000 sind ganz nahe und ich kann es kaum erwarten die 10000 zu durchbrechen. 6) Was sollten die Leute sonst über euch wissen? Ich bin Ice-Cream-süchtig. Ohne mit der Wimper zu schlagen verschlinge ich einen ganzen Cup Ben and Jerrys. 7) Welchen Impact wollt ihr in den nächsten Jahren erreichen? Bis 2020 wollen wie an die 5 Millionen User haben und den Menschen helfen ein nachhaltiges Leben zu führen. 8) Welche Superkräfte hättet ihr gerne? Ich bin ein großer Batman Fan und ich liebe Technologie. Daher hätte ich gerne seine Superkraft coole Technik zu entwickeln um den Menschen zu helfen. Franchise in Australien Der Ruf der Idee überbrückt sogar Kontinente. Mittlerweile laufen Pläne eine bgood.at Filiale in Melbourne, Australien zu launchen. Für das nächste Jahr benötigen die beiden 100.000 Euro. Ein Crowdfunding Projekt befindet sich ebenfalls in ihrer Pipeline und die Suche nach einem Investor.","September 1, 2015","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bgood-group-600x400.jpg"
"4","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/09/23/impact-hub-ventures-support-refugees/","ImpactHub","Impact Hub Ventures support refugees","Close to 80,000 people were refugees or asylum seekers in Austria in 2014, according to the UNHCR. The migratory flow caused by the Syrian crisis has increased this number in 2015 significantly. Civil society came together to welcome and assist the people who fled and many of our members have played a part in this. Here are some of the Hubbers projects: Flüchtlinge Wilkommen: Opening our doors to refugees (Winner Social Impact Award 2015) “Why shouldn’t refugees in Austria be able to live in shared flats (or other normal housing situations) instead of mass accommodation?”. As an answer, the website www.fluechtlinge-willkommen.at proposes individuals to open their house to refugees. After registration on the website, they are put in touch with a person who fled, via a refugee organization. Hosts can get some help to finance the rent, as recognized refugees are entitled to a certain amount of money to cover their housing needs. Talentify: Helping young refugees to learn German with peers Talentify is a social business aiming at establishing a sustainable peer-to-peer online platform that helps young people to develop their full potential regardless of their parents’ social or financial background. They started the initiative “Wir helfen!” in order for young refugees to learn German. The Austrian volunteers are 14 to 19 years old and based in Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland. Most of the young refugees are isolated minors. This project will also help them developing a trusting and friendly relationship. Magdas Hotel: The first hotel run by Refugees in Europe It has opened its doors and 78 rooms in February this year, in the Prater area. The trendy and cosy Magdas Hotel is the first hotel in Europe run by refugees. This social business founded by Caritas is providing high quality services to worldwide travellers in 27 languages. The team is composed of sixteen nationalities. A hotel wing is hosting foreign isolated minors, and dinners with refugees are regularly open to public. Topfreisen.at: Working in the area of international gastronomy with the asylum seekers (Social Impact Start 2014) The asylum seekers of the St Gabriel’s mission residency are employed by Topfreisen.at to prepare international meals. This project offers them “a chance to pursue meaningful employment and makes them proud to share their culture”. Topfreisen.at provides catering for private celebration or corporate events. Benefits are used to finance German courses, excursions and leisure activities. Use potential: Revolutionizing refugee camps (Social Impact Award Winner 2015) Use potential’s mission is “to allow for every refugee registered in a camp to document and use their most relevant skills to improve the living conditions and mental health of refugees worldwide”. At registration in the camp, every individual is asked about his/her most important skills and knowledge and contacted later on to be part of volunteer-groups. “All eligible inhabitants of the camp are invited to participate with their knowledge and expertise. By creating and participating, displaced people regain ownership”. Whatchado: Three jobs opening for refugees (Social Impact Award Winner 2011) Whatchado is a successful online video platform to “find people, job and career that match your interests”. Three jobs have been opened at Whatchado for recognized refugees. Knowledge of Arabic or Dari/Farsi and English is required, as well as video making skills (CV and motivation letter to be sent to [email protected]). A special channel “refugee stories” will be launched on the platform. Younited Cultures: Promoting cultural diversity (Social Impact Start Award 2014) To “celebrate migration” -its slogan-, Younited Cultures creates trendy scarves on which the story of successful immigrants is transformed into patterns drawn together with designers. Younited Cultures’ best-seller is a very colourful scarf that aims to become a symbol for cultural diversity. Andra Slaats, co-founder, is currently planning a “Celebrate Migration Tour” in Austria to change the perception on migrants.

"5","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/10/06/10-reasons-to-consider-crowdfunding-for-your-business/","ImpactHub","10 reasons to consider crowdfunding for your business","It is a fact that crowdfunding has already proven itself to be a successful alternative in acquiring money and it looks like this will not change any time soon. Of course a crowdfunding campaign is a lot of work but we’d like you to remember why it’s worth to think about starting your business with crowdfunding. So here are 10 advantages which might motivate you to do a crowdfunding campaign too. Crowdfunding is a relatively inexpensive source of funding Yes, you need to invest time in creating a crowdfunding campaign and sometimes you also need to invest money to create the materials you need for the campaign. But looking for an investment you have to do this anyway, so your investment of time or little money is not particular required for crowdfunding. You run your campaign by yourself and your team so you are able to control the costs of the campaign. You keep 100% ownership of your project Maybe you have already considered different ways to acquire money for the start of your business and every one has it’s own advantages and risks. We won’t talk you out of any way to find an investor but if you are willing to keep 100% of your business in your hands than crowdfundíng could be your choice ;). A campaign failure is not a dead end Alright let’s be honest: nobody is perfect and yes it happens that crowdfunding campaigns fail. So what?! It is not the end of everything and from a positive perspective a failure gives you the chance to get better. Learn from your mistakes, talk to other entrepreneurs and start over again. Maybe again with crowdfunding, maybe with another way to get your business financed. Just do it! You get the chance of minimizing your risk because you can test the market A crowdfunding campaign gives you valuable insights into the market and how your product/service will fit into it. You get the direct feedback from backers and you’ll get insights of the first round of preorders. This helps you to classify or adjust your business according to the market. If you run a good campaign this will give you potentially huge promotional effect Crowdfunding sounds like an easy way to get your business started but don’t forget: you are not the only one funding money this way. So get your stuff done and run a good campaign, which means to take your time and prepare the campaign properly. Therefore you need a communication strategy and an idea of the presentation flow on the platform. Think about how to pitch your business (video pitch, pictures, future plans, team, why crowdfunding, rewards, FAQs, how supporters can help) and you take another step to your success and also very important: you will get publicity Use the chance to win backers as promoters If you have convinced the crowd from the beauty of your idea and won their trust, they will help to spread the word because they also want to see your business on the market. But be careful: their trust is very precious. Don’t disappoint your backers! The campaign is a first test of your marketing strategy We talked already about the opportunity of failure and even if we assume that you will succeed with your campaign, crowdfunding also helps you to evaluate your marketing strategy. As written before you’ll get direct feedback from the crowd and this helps you to refine your strategy if needed. Full independence of product development With a campaign run by yourself and your team you are independent in terms of product development. As you read before you will get a lot of helpful insights with which you are able to improve your business. Get Feedback from your backers You read a lot of direct feedback so far and it seems this is one of the key advantages of a crowdfunding campaign. We think so too, because when and where do you have the chance to get feedback before your start your business from your potential clients? Besides the part where you just get feedback you can also work with it. Getting the “feed-backers” on board and figuring out how you can work together sounds like a win-win situation, don’t you think? Crowdfunding can help to access the second round of funding easier So your campaign succeeded. Congratulations! If you need a second round of funding money you already learned a lot and you are in the position to profit from your skills. So take a breathe because you fund your base from which you can build up your business and take the next steps. It seems that crowdfunding is in fact worth trying but for the sake of completeness we’d like to mention that there are risks too. Not every product is suitable for crowdfunding, it can be a demanding and complex project because you need to know how to manage the project & people involved with, you need active personal involvement because crowdfunding is build on trust, it is a difficult task to convince a mass of potential backers as opposed to a single investor, you will have a responsibility to the backer community and last but not least you will expose your idea to the public. Nevertheless crowdfunding is one way to acquire money for your business. So take your time and choose the way which fits best to get your startup financed and be kind to share your learnings with other entrepreneurs.

"6","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/10/07/newmembershippilotproject/","ImpactHub","We’re participating in the New Membership Pilot Project","We’re excited to let you know we are one of the fifteen Impact Hubs (along with Kings Cross London, Prague, Sao Paulo, Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, Stockholm, Belgrade, Bucharest, Brno, Ostrava, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam and Geneva) across the globe who will be piloting an upgrade of the Impact Hub Membership experience starting late September 2015. This blog will give you a bit of background about the project and of course explain the new opportunities for you as a Hubber. From our annual member survey we know that you are actually very happy with your local Impact Hub member experience (though it can be improved, naturally). This pilot project is about building upon local strengths and adding what you seem to miss most: better global connectivity and a sense of belonging. Therefore as Pilot Hubs we’ve worked hard to align the membership experience across Impact Hubs with the goal of being able to say: there is one Impact Hub Membership. You still have your Home Hub which is dedicated to personally hosting you, but you now have many “homes-away-from-home”. The experience and support you can expect in any Impact Hub will be the same. You are an Impact Hub member, not “just” an Impact Hub Vienna member. The pilot has three different phases and Phase 1 is just launching. What does Phase 1 mean for you as a Hubber? Updated membership model: Our product structure is now globally aligned to be more flexible and give you access to more opportunities (this image makes it clearer). Prices don’t change, but you will get more benefits. Membership of Impact Hub is the base. On top you can buy the services that fit your needs. And you can get services not just from your Home Hub, but also from other Impact Hubs. Meet and work in any Impact Hub: If you are a Hubber who travels you can meet up in any local Pilot Impact Hub (and somewhere in 2016, everywhere). If you also have a coworking package (starting at 10 hours – previously known as Connect+ to Workspace Unlimited), you can now use it in all Pilot Impact Hubs! If you use over 50% of your time in one other specific Impact Hub, we’ll ask you to get your coworking package in that specific Impact Hub. The only thing you need to do when you travel is say hi to the local host so we can arrange the administrative part without bothering you with it. As an optional service to you, you can go to passport.impacthub.net and check-in before you travel in order to be hosted better. Better and more recognizable events: we’ve sourced event best-practices from our network and selected 3 monthly events that will take place in all Pilot Hubs. They link to the value propositions #Inspire, #Connect, #Enable which are central to your membership experience. Are you a member who travels? You will know these events take place in other Impact Hubs and that it will be an easy way for you to connect with the local community. Build profile and gain visibility: we are building global communication channels, which you will be able to access and spread the word around your work. Not interested in gaining visibility? You will soon start receiving exclusive insightful stories from the global network. In the second and third phase we will add the following concrete changes for you: Virtual business opportunities: currently Membership is still quite space-centric. By using better virtual platforms we will increase the value proposition for you even if you don’t access the space frequently. Access a network of 11’000+ makers: with so many members, so many opportunities for collaboration and/or learning exist for you. We are building a better database of members and improve the way you can search for and connect with other members. We’re looking forward to test these changes with you and our fellow Pilot Hubs: Kings Cross London, Prague, Sao Paulo, Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, Stockholm, Belgrade, Bucharest, Brno, Ostrava, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam and Geneva. Is the Impact Hub you want to connect with not on that list? We are sure they’ll do their utmost to give you the same experience, but they can’t guarantee it. Yet :). Since this is a pilot project, we will need your help to figure out what value we are creating for you. What is working? What isn’t? Which other opportunities are we missing? Please tweet at us using #ImpactHubMembership and help making your Impact Hub Membership better, and get in touch with Dushan to share your feedback and ideas. Thank you very much! And welcome on board, welcome on a journey to the new Impact Hub Membership!","October 7, 2015","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/test_membership_visual_kw-600x400.png"

As the numbers of our community grew so did our fields of interest, collaboration and action. In response to this emergent reality we aim to encourage the formation of sub-communities of members around a common field of interest, to collaborate and take action through the creation of Impact HubClubs. The Neongreen HubClub This is a first call to action for those members and future members that take Earth Centered Actions as entrepreneurs, investors, researchers, innovators, journalists, politicians, bankers, activists, public servants, corporates etc. Visionaries, doers and thinkers, people looking for solutions and those who have found one – you are all invited. Impact does not happen in isolation – it takes collective action, alliances, collaborations, and partnerships. If you are looking to increase the impact of your actions by joining forces with Earth-minded peers the Neongreen HubClub is your community. First Gathering: Divestment – where the money meets the planet The first gathering will tackle the intersection between money and planet: the risks for the earth are risks for the pocket. Divestment is a controversial topic. According to The Guardian, The founder of Microsoft and the Gates foundation criticised the global movement that has seen pension funds, universities, churches and local governments worth $2.6tn commit to pulling their investments out of coal, oil and gas companies. The follow up of the debate made Gates invest $2bn (£1.3bn) in breakthrough renewable technology projects over the next five years –double his investments to date. If you want to know or do more about this topic, join the debate at the first Neongreen HubClub on the 30th of October. Mr. Mark Campanale (Founder and Director of the London based “Carbon Tracker” Institute) will talk about the global divestment movement. Georg Günsberg and Wolfgang Rattay will present the events of a short study on divestment potential in Austria, funded by the Green Party. This will be followed by a discussion of the results, with the authors of the study, MP Christiane Brunner, Mark Campanale and a representative from the financial industry. The 1st “Neongreen HubClub” is hosted by NEONGREEN NETWORK and Impact HUB Vienna, in cooperation with the Green Party and the oekostrom PLC, Austria’s largest renewable energy company.

This year’s competition looked specifically for ideas that would promote ‘New Ways to Grow’ across European society. The idea behind the competition is to create and enable new kinds of economic growth that can create systemic change and a positive impact on society. The shortlisted ideas have the potential to bring value to individuals, communities, countries and entire regions, and reflect the issues and concerns at the heart of many Europeans’ lives. The innovations aim to create solutions and respond to concerns such as our ageing population, food waste, sustainable production, organic farming, and accessibility. The finalists come from Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia and Poland, and their ideas reflect the creativity of a generation of Europeans who have lived through boom and bust and have a vision to innovate to create a more sustainable growth model: Apiform – Sit-in beekeeping Bosnia and Herzegovina De Landgenoten Belgium LastMinuteSottoCasa Italy Mela Wear Germany Phee Greece Samaritan Mobile Care Complex Latvia Smart Hearing Aid Croatia The Freebird Club Ireland The Social Good Vending Machine Poland Wheeliz France The 30 semi-finalists attended a mentoring academy in Vienna in September where they worked with experts in social innovation to refine their ideas and develop their business plan before pitching to the jury. The jury is made up of successful social innovators from around Europe, who critically evaluate the strength of each organisation’s business plan and have selected the 10 strongest entries. Jury member and Ashoka Country Director for Poland Agata Stafiej-Bartosik commented: “I think I can speak for everyone involved when I say that selecting just 10 finalists was tough – we were inspired by the quality of the semi-finalists and by the drive and vision they demonstrated with their proposals. It’s fantastic to see that people are innovating all around Europe, these projects have real potential to create sustainable growth and a positive future. Congratulations to all the finalists.” Gabriela Sonnleitner, CEO of Magdas Social Business reflects: “It was a real pleasure to host the mentoring academy at our hotel in Vienna. We too were selected as finalists for the competition in 2013 – we didn’t win but the journey and support that we got from the competition really helped us to get where we are today – a thriving social business providing employment opportunities for refugees. The European Social Innovation Competition is about identifying great ideas, not all of them will win but being selected as a semi-finalist or finalist is a fantastic achievement. Keep going – your organisations can and will change the world, little by little and there is a network out there all across Europe ready to support you.” The ten finalists will pitch for their chance to win one of three €50,000 prizes on at the awards ceremony on the 25th November in Brussels.

"11","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/11/02/storytellinghackathon/","ImpactHub","1001 ISTANBUL – STORYTELLING HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL IMPACT","A good story has the power to change the world. Each day, thousands of change makers and creative heads all around the word create powerful stories and projects with the aim to create change, and to make the world a better place. All of these stories are worth it, being told, but how should they have an impact, if nobody knows them? How could we spread the word about current projects, problems and problem-solving social enterprises? Impact Hub Vienna and Impact Hub Istanbul asked themselves the same questions, and they even went one step further. They asked themselves „What would happen, if we would bring those change-makes and creative-heads together at a special place and allow them to collaborate and be creative for a limited amount of time!?“ Out of this questions, a great project, the >>1001 Storytelling Hackathon for social Impact<< arose, and I had the honor to be one of the participating creative-heads. >> TELL A STORY. MAKE A DIFFERENCE! << This was the motto, under which more than 30 creatives from all over Europe gathered in Istanbul – the place where storytelling has its roots – from the 9th to 12th of October, for the first European Storytelling Hackathon ever.The aim was to create sustainable solutions for 5 different social enterprises based in Istanbul. Those solutions were to be developed, presented and activated within the time limit of 48 hours. THE HACKATHON & THE RESULT After arriving in Istanbul and getting a feeling for the city while doing a food tour, we soon gathered at the lab, where we would would spend most of the time during the following days. The first evening was introduced by a great storyteller from Istanbul, who created a story around social impact for us. Perfectly in the mood of storytelling and social engagement, we got to know the 5 enterprises and their current situation. After deciding on woking-groups an a quite short night, the working flow started Saturday morning and would end only on Sunday evening around nine. During these hours we did brainstorming and idea collecting. We shot photographs and videos, edited them, wrote stories and put together whole web-pages and marketing-strategies together. Sunday-evening, after very little of sleep and many hours of intensive working, we got to the moment of presentation. Each of the projects surprised with great ideas and results. It is incredible, what can be achieved within such a little amount of time, if a group of creative and motivated people comes together and works for a common aim. The presentations were stunning, but what was even more overwhelming, was to see the happiness of the organizers and entrepreneurs that could hardly believe that so many young creatives had gathered, only to help them make their way. If one would calculate the value of the content that has been created during these two days, it would be an incredible large sum, but all the experiences and happy moments count more than any money. All in all, we spent some emotional intensive days ranking from excitement to tiredness, stress and exhaustion to happiness and joy. Especially the final round, when everybody shared his feelings, was truly powerful and emotional. THE IMPACT OF THE HACKATHON Social entrepreneurship might be perceived as „normal“ in many big cities of this world, but in Istanbul it has not reached normality yet. This is why the Impact Hub Istanbul aims to open its doors in order to create a space for the creative potential of the city. The Storytelling Hackathon functioned as a pioneering event of the local community in order to create awareness amongst external people and to communicate the values of the hub, upcoming projects and this working method. At this point you might think, „Well that’s great. You created social impact in Istanbul and helped these companies!“ but I can tell you that this hackathon created far more impact than awareness amongst local in Istanbul only. For the first time I realized what it means to be totally engaged in a project. I understood what it means to do something for others. I understood what co-working means, how to work together, how to develop ideas and how to use the individual abilities of each of the team-members and to combine them. I got to know how impact can happen in collaboration. I suddenly also understood what the Impact Hub is doing and how it really works. After this week-end, I feel far more connected to the Hub itself – not only to my team-members but to the whole community. A RESUMÈ after … 16 hours of sleep within four nights 48 hours of intensive work no access to facebook and twitter … i can look back onto … 5 great projects > 30 inspiring and fazinating personalities > 3 extraordinary solutions for the companies problems invaluable exeriences and contacts I am overwhelmed, happy and thankful that I was allowed to be part of such a great project. I am looking forward to see it happen again and to hopefully be part of it for a second time.","November 2, 2015","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Header-600x400.jpg"
"12","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/11/04/younitedcultures-migration/","ImpactHub","Younited Cultures celebrates migrant success stories with colorful scarves","Celebrate migration! Younited Cultures is turning successful migrant stories into colorful scarves. One of the founders Andra Slaats tells us the story of how that came about. Andra met her husband in Vienna and decided to move to Austria 10 years ago. After the difficult process of learning German she eventually found a job at an Austrian luxury cosmetics company. For six years, she got the opportunity to travel the world but at the same time she was confronted with discrimination in her own team. The experience inspired her to devote her time and creativity to the promotion of cultural diversity. Younited Cultures was set up by Andra and her partner Iulia Mugescu in 2014. The company creates trendy scarves which tell the story of successful immigrants with the help of designers. Supported by Impact Hub Vienna throughout her career as a young entrepreneur, Andra knows what she owes to those who have encouraged and supported her in the making Younited Cultures itself a success story. Impact Hub Vienna: What is Younited Culture? Andra Slaats: Younited Culture is a Vienna-based social enterprise using fashion as a statement for cultural diversity. Our goal is to identify impactful and inspiring success stories for every culture and telling them through a sustainable and locally made scarf. We produce items with a simple and elegant design and the slogan “Celebrate migration” IHV: How does it work? AS: Creating a scarf is an intriguing process. First, we identify and approach a successful immigrant. Then, our designer is going through a process of interview and design together with him or her. When the scarf is ready, it has to be approved by the immigrant. Finally, the prototype is sent for production in Austria or Italy. Our bestseller however is our signature scarf. A very colourful design that symbolizes cultural diversity. People wear the scarf to make a statement. It’s awesome! IHV: What is a successful immigrant? AS: I think it is someone who is integrated, runs his/her own business or has a job where he/she can create value, and who stays in Austria despites discrimination. Our first storyteller was a Polish woman, Adela Kuliga. She arrived in Austria 10 years earlier to be with her future husband. She left a promising career in her country to come to Vienna without speaking any German and without any job perspective. While engaging in menial jobs, she learned German and then worked as a professional trainer in the Integration sector. Later on, she funded an NGO “Networking Youth Career” for immigrants helping them on their career paths. Now she directly impacts the lives of more than 2,000 people every year. IHV: Tell us about your background. AS: I arrived in Vienna ten years ago. Love brought me here as well. I did not know a word of German and honestly didn’t like the language. In Romania, my country of origin, I was an Englis and French translator. As I had to find my way in Austria, I tried hard to learn German within a year, hoping that I would find a job in which I could grow into. I started working for an Austrian cosmetics company in International Sales. I was happy but unfortunately, I started to feel discriminated and unwanted within the team. During those six months, I suffered badly from this situation. I felt discouraged there was such a disconnect between my colleagues and friends. It took me two years to accept the fact that I could not change the people that I was working with but that I had to change jobs. My boss on the other hand was very supportive and she valued my knowledge and passion to work for her brand. Two years later I was made Export Manager. I travelled around the world, discovered rich and poor cultures, but experienced as well the way some suppliers were working with their employees. In China for example, I remember the tired faces of people working until 10pm. I will never forget that. After 3 years, I took a sabbatical leave to study Sales and Marketing Management and that year transformed my life. “The plants were dying all the time.” IHV: How did you become part of the Impact Hub network? AS: My brother introduced me to Impact Hub Vienna during my sabbatical leave in 2012. I started working on his project called “Window Farm”, a product in which plants can be grown in a closed loop system made out of recycled plastic bottles. As an added value, immigrant women with little chance to find work, would be employed on a flexible time for a few hours a week. Unfortunately, it did not work for me though. The plants were dying all the time. I don’t think it was a problem with the product but rather my gardening skills. I pitched for this project at the Social Impact Start in 2013 nonetheless. At that time, I had never spoken in public and never wanted to either. But I felt safe and inspired by other entrepreneurs who took risks and jumped in cold water every day. They were happy at what they were doing. Now, of course, I did not win the pitch, but the Social Impact Start opened a door. Alexis Eremia, co-founder and Managing Director of Impact Hub Vienna, asked me shortly after my presentation: “Why don’t you keep what motivates you [supporting people with different cultural background] but change the product? You obviously don’t feel passionate about the product but more about the impact it brought. So find a product that you like and have the same impact on migrants”. This was a turning point. We met the next week and brainstormed on products until we discovered it could be a fashion product. So she gave me the contact of a Latvian designer of scarves. IHV: How did you meet your partner? AS: While hosting at the IHV, I met Iulia Mugescu, the Marketing Manager of Younited Cultures. She is from Romania, like me, and was part of the IHV team. Previously she was President of AIESEC Austria a global platform for young people to explore and develop their leadership potential. “I am no longer scared to do things I am not comfortable with.” IHV: After the Social Impact Start, what was your next step? AS: In April 2014, I pitched for the Social Impact Start again. This time with our own product and we won! Matthias Reisinger, another co-founder and Director of Impact Hub Vienna later said “This is the difference between pitching a product and owning a product”. We were really enthusiastic and won an 8-month programme including 20 hours of expert advice, a full membership and co-working space at the Hub and mentoring from SAP. Later in August we won the Social Impact Start Award that brought us 5,000 euros. IHV: How did you finance your project? AS: We invested 5,000 euros at the beginning, won 5,000 euros from the Social Impact Start Award, 5,000 euros from crowdfunding and took a 10,000 euros credit. State funds were not possible due to the criteria they had. We just never fit the profile unfortunately. So we decided to get a bank credit. They were less fussy. IHV: What challenges have you been facing and how did you manage? AS: We wanted the whole production to be made in Austria, but the costs were really too high. We are now producing in Italy with a family company that has worked in textiles for generations. More generally, I am no longer scared to do things I am not comfortable with. I did so many. I jumped in cold water so often, that now it’s just like warm every time I do a new thing! I also hate doing things that I don’t like doing: Public Relations for example… Not fun, but it brings results. So, I do it. And now it’s kind of growing on me. I get to meet interesting people and journalists. “Thousands of potential success stories.” IHV: At what stage is Younited Cultures now? AS: In August 2014, we created a limited company. Six months later, we launched three products and got a lot of media coverage. Now, we are in the operations phase. Sales are done online, we open discussions with shops, participate at fairs. We also offer workshops for corporations, where they can create their own scarf in a team building effort. IHV: What did the IHV bring to your project? AS: What I really appreciate at the Hub is that everybody takes time to go deep into your project, no matter if he/she is a member or a co-founder. We are growing within this entrepreneur atmosphere where everyone is willing to help. There are also some other benefits as member of the Hub. In 2013 I won a €25,000 scholarship for an MBA in Sustainable Development Management. Thanks to this, I could meet investors, marketers and gain knowledge in strategy, sales, graphic facilitation and negotiations. There were experts from all around the world teaching classes. I am now writing my master thesis on women immigrants in top management positions in Austria. IHV: What is the next step you want to take? AS: We are organizing a “Celebrate Migration Tour” in Austria. We want to create some buzz in Austria for how migration can also be perceived as thousands of potential success stories.

Let’s picture one of them. Her name is Susi. She lives in Vienna and started a food blog a few weeks ago. In order to get some followers and build a community around her blog she launched an Instagram account aswell. She takes a picture of her latest creation, a sweet desert and uploads it on her Instagram account in the evening. A few minutes later she gets likes and comments on her post. All the engagement on her picture are from the US and asian countries and nobody from Austria, not even her friends are liking or dropping a post on her account. Plan your content in advance Even though Susi’s picture is gaining attraction she missed one point that boosts engagement. She didn’t consider the timing of her post on Instagram. In the US it is noon and in Europe/Austria it is around 8 pm. Everybody is having their dinner, watching TV and nobody has time to check their Instagram app. In order to get more people on her social media channels, Susi needs a schedule of when to post on her profiles. What to consider before posting? Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and many more social media channels are a great opportunity to spread the word about your business. They are perfect tools to gain followers and fans, who can share your posts and help you gain popularity. Keeping them updated is a great way to interact with your audience and to shape the quality of your product or idea. There are certain factors to consider when thinking about how and when to use your social media accounts: First ask yourself what are the benefits for your audience of your media post? Always think of value that you provide. Think of the channel you use! Is your business picture-driven, you should focus more on Instagram, for live feeds or quotes use Twitter. Timing is crucial! Set a day and time when to publish. It is always good to have pile of content, in case you run out. Regular and fixed dates help your followers know when to expect a new post from you. Finally think of the context. Does your post fit for Facebook, Twitter, etc. or does a blog post create more attraction? When are the peak times to post? The alpha in social media is still Facebook. With approximately 2 Billion users they serve as the role-model. Almost every company has a Facebook account and it is the first choice of startups for entering the social media world. People with an age range of 18 to 49 years use Facebook for private and business purposes. The best time to post are Thursdays and Fridays around 1 to 3 pm. Many people at work have their lunch break and parents check the internet during their child’s naptime. Instagram, owned by Facebook, is consistent throughout the week. According to Fortune Magazin the peak time of engagement is on Monday from 3 to 4 pm. Target groups are young people. But companies like Red Bull or BBC found the benefits of an account for building communities. An even more limited channel is Twitter. Only text with 140 characters, 30 second videos were integrated too. Right after Facebook it is the second most popular social media channel, but with only 241 Million users. During workdays companies mainly use Twitter for B2B or B2C. Users tend to browse through, create lists or press the „following“ button. Engagement from users shifted to the weekends. Neil Patel from Quicksprout says that around 5 pm are the highest rates of retweets and together with Instagram they aim for teens and business owners. Linkedin surfaced as the channel for professionals and it is obvious that high engagement rates can be located from Tuesday to Thursday from 10 to 11 am. In the middle of the workweek users are fresh in mind and ready to gain or spread knowledge. Millennials are the main user base for Linkedin, using it for branch news and professional advice. Examine yourself At the end take a look at yourself and track time when you use your social media accounts. Through this way you can relate to your users. The most important thing is to post on a regular basis.

Invented by Ahmed Adel, Engineer, in 2012, its patented technology is based on suspension bridge design. The Solabolic parabolic is designed to achieve the following goals: increasing the economic efficiency of concentrated solar power overcoming manufacturing, transport and size limits maximizing local content for developing economies Less costs and improvement for society and environment Using tensile forces with cost effective manufacturing processes, Solabolic achieves a precise parabolic shape required to focus the sun light. The heat produced can be used to power a steam turbine in order to generate electricity, or directly, to desalinate sea water for example. “Solabolic is not just a technology. It is a solution with many socio-economical and environmental aspects, such as food security, clean energy, job creation and clean water”, says Stefan Nolte, Financial Manager. The Startup can realize the industry’s largest dimensions with 20-30% less material. Its technology leads to a reduction cost by 35% in the solar field. One of its most important advantages: maximizing the utilization of local resources and manpower in the developing countries. Indeed, the production of the parabolic shape – achieved via physical principals – does not require complicated manufacturing processes. The Success-Story of Solabolic Ahmed Adel is the inventor and patent owner of the Solabolic technology. He started working on it in 2012, while being Research assistant at the Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Energy Systems and Thermo Dynamics. He was joined in the Solabolic adventure by Stefan Nolte as Financial Manager to further advance the project. Stefan has worked for fours years in Finance, Mergers & Acquisitions and did transactions in the Renewable Energy sector. He was interested in a new challenge and found Ahmed to make it happen. The Solabolic competitive advantages have been confirmed by the Vienna University of Technology. Ahmed and Stefan were awarded the ClimateLaunchpad Austria in 2015, the Europe’s Largest Cleantech Business Idea competition with over 700 teams from 28 countries, and were ranked among the top 7 start-ups in Europe. Solabolic was recently selected for the Climate-KIC accelerator and for receiving the AWS PreSeed government grants. A memorandum of understanding has been signed between Solabolic and the Egyptian government. Ahmed and Stefan are now looking for business angels to bring Solabolic to the next step.

"16","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2015/11/17/how-to-suceed-in-your-business-with-nonverbal-communication/","ImpactHub","How to succeed in your business with nonverbal communication","Communication is the essence of our daily lives and even when we are not talking to anyone we are communicating. The explicit meaning of words is just one aspect of human communication. The implicit messages, whether intentional or not, which are expressed through non-verbal behaviours also belong to human communication. Nonverbal communications include facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, gestures displayed through body language and the physical distance between the communicators. Jeff Cabili, Expert of nonverbal communication, has some answers on how to use nonverbal communication sucessfully for your busines. Jeff Cabili, Expert in nonverbal communicationWhat is the essence of nonverbal communication and why is it important?NVC (nonverbal communication) in a business context accounts for at least 70% of the whole communication process. It comprises the movements, gestures and postures of the body (body language), the facial expressions as well as the use of the voice. It is important because it can reinforce, support or contradict the verbal message. When used properly with the verbal message, it can create a greater impact from the speaker upon the audience and keep the attendees captivated. What are the keys to effective nonverbal communication?The knowledge on which signals and nonverbal cues can reinforce the verbal message. A proper use of those and especially the avoidance of other signals which are not relevant will keep the interest and attention of the attendees. Nonverbal communication happens subconsciously: what are your tips to control it/improve it especially in situations people do not deal with every day. For instance during presentations or talking in front of a large audience. Some signals are sent unconsciously by the speaker when he/she is trying to deceive or to hide some information. They should not be present if the speaker knows his content and is “relaxed”. In cases of anxiety and nervousness, I suggest that he/she take: a deep breath, three times and slowly a brief physical exercise, such as climbing up/down the stairs for 5 min an auto suggestion of future success, such as talking to oneself in front of a mirror and convince whom you see that he/she is going to do a stellar lecture. Pitch presentation: you have 2 Minutes time to convince the investors not just about the business idea, but also about the fact that they are giving their money to the “right person”. What are your tipps to succeed in this situation? Know your content, talk briefly of the founders, use 3-5 slides for a 6 min presentation, explain why the idea will create a revolution and show enthusiasm.

Meerestiere verwechseln diese und andere Plastikteile häufig mit Nahrung und verenden qualvoll. Das sind nur ein paar Argumente, warum man sich eine Flasche kaufen sollte, die man immer dabei hat und diese mit dem besten Wasser der Welt füllt ( Wiener Leitungswasser). soulbottles unterstützt diese Mission mit schön designten Glasflaschen. Gegründet wurde soulbottles von Georg und Paul. Richtig los ging es mit einer Crowdfunding-Kampagne vor 2,5 Jahren. Mit Hilfe der Community hat soulbottles 2014 30.000 soulbottles verkauft. 2015 werden es wohl mehr als doppelt so viel werden. Um weiter zu wachsen – auch über den deutschsprachigen Raum hinaus, suchen die beiden Hubber nach Investoren. Sinnvoll investieren und sauberes Trinkwasser für Menschen in Nepal Nach dem Erfolg der Crowdfunding Kampagne macht soulbottles jetzt eine Crowdlending Kampagne. Investoren bekommen eine Festverzinsung von 4% p.a. plus Gewinnbeteiligung, also ein Vielfaches dessen, was man auf dem Sparkonto bekommt. soulbottles bekommt dadurch die Möglichkeit, weiter zu wachsen und die steigende Nachfrage ohne Engpässe zu bedienen. Das Wichtigste: Mehr Menschen bekommen Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser. 2014 kam anteilig für jede verkaufte soulbottle 30.000€ zusammen um gemeinsam mit Viva con Agua mehr als 2.500 Menschen in Nepal Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser ermöglichen – mit jeder verkauften soulbottle werden es mehr. Wie ihr soulbottles in ihrer Mission unterstützen könnt: Wer interessiert ist, Geld bei soulbottles anzulegen oder noch Fragen habt, liest sich das Faltblatt durch – es enthält alle Details zum Investment und Informationen für die folgenden Schritte.

Indeed, there is nothing compared to a freshly baked cake made by a granny and savoured in a 60-70’s atmosphere. At the Vollpension, pensioners prepare meals and desserts served by young people. It is a place where generations meet, share stories and life experiences. Through events such as storytelling evening and knitting workshop, the coffeehouse creates an attention towards intergenerational topics. “Giving older people the chance to earn some money next to their pensions is also a social impact we are proud of”, says David Haller. Today, around 25 people work at the Vollpension, including 15 grannies and grandpas, from Tuesday to Sunday. The recruitment process is easy. The grannies come either by word of mouth or after a visit. The only criteria to be part of the team: being at least 55 years old, loving the contact with young people and, of course, having certain baking skills. Vollpension coffeehouse visitors are not the only ones to savour the grannies’recipes. Every Wednesday, a Vollpension granny is cooking at Impact Hub Vienna.“The Hubbers love our grannies, like everybody else”, concludes David Haller. And he is absolutely right: we got the chance to interview one of the grannies. Click the video below to watch our lovely chat with granny Zora.

They were created in 2008 – since 2009 they are available – but especially this summer, Lemonaid und ChariTea were “the drinks to enjoy”. Not only because they taste great, but also because the idea of helping social projects witch each bottle you buy, is a very pleasant one. It all started in a kitchen in Hamburg, when Paul Bethke, Jakob Berndt and Felix Langgeht mixed lime-juice, cane sugar, sparkling water and different other ingredients, until they found the perfect lemonade. After their home-production got inefficient, Lemonaid is now produced in collaboration with a local organic farmer and aims to do more than quenching our thirst. The name says it all: LemonAID helps ! Each bottle aims to contribute to social change and to make the world a better place through one of our human needs – drinking. With each sip of Lemonade you support fair trade and the Lemonaid & ChariTea e.V. which promotes different development projects. Good taste and social engagement don’t know any season! At Impact Hub Vienna, Lemonaid and ChariTea are the refreshment-drinks N°1. Yet, as it got colder outside, and winter arrived, I had to observe that the bottles where switched to mugs filled with hot tea and coffee. “What a Pitty!” I thought. “They are still delicious – and those projects need our support in winter-time as much as in any other season of the year!” This is how i came up with the idea of creating a wintery HOT Lemonaid, inspired by its original ingredients, the ones used for punch and my fantasy. The result is a totally new Lemonaid experience. Warming, if it is enjoyed hot – refreshing as it is carbonated – yet with a fruity and sweet counterpart. Try it out – be astonished – enjoy and save the world !

Ein „Muss-Event“ für Wiener Sozialunternehmer und die, die es noch werden wollen. 2016 wird der größte Studentenwettbewerb für soziales Unternehmertum in Österreich bereits zum achten Mal ausgetragen. Was genau der Social Impact Award eigentlich ist und wie er vielleicht auch dich bei der Umsetzung deiner Idee unterstützen kann, das verrate ich dir heute. (Eine Bildergalerie ist am Ende des Artikel zu finden) DER SOCIAL IMPACT AWARD Immer mehr Studenten stellen sich nicht mehr die Frage, welchen Beruf sie ausüben wollen, sondern welches Problem sie Lösen wollen.Eine neue Herangehensweise an die *Arbeitswelt*. Der geeignete Arbeitsplatz wird nicht mehr gesucht sondern erschaffen – oftmals in Eigenregie. Beim Kick-off Event des SIA konnten alle Interessierten erfahren, wie sie der SIA auf diesem Weg unterstützen kann und in direkten Kontakt mit erfolgreichen Sozialunternehmern wie Gabriela Sonnleitner vom Magdas Hotel, Hannah Lux, Geschäftsführerin der Vollpension, Bernhard Hofer von Talentify oder Moriz Piffl-Percevic, einer der Gebrüder Stitch treten. WAS IST DER *SOCIAL IMPACT AWARD* ? An dieser Stelle lasse ich ein Video für sich sprechen. Es erklärt nämlich sehr gut und genau, was der SIA ist – was er (für dich) tut – und welches Ziel er verfolgt. Peter Vandor, Gründer des SIA – Competence Center for Non Profit Organizations and Social Entrepreneurship, beschrieb uns, was den SIA so besonders macht. Kurz gesagt unterstützt der SIA Studierende, unternehmerisches Denken mit sozialem Handeln zu verbinden. Die besten 10 Projektideen bekommen Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung und erhalten ein kostenloses Inkubationsprogrammund. Die 5 besten Projekte werden zusätzlich ausgezeichnet und erhalten 3.000 € (4 Jury Awards) bzw. 2.000 € (Community Award) sowie zusätzliche Unterstützung. Wer den gesamten Prozess durchläuft hat es geschafft und ist einer der Gewinner des SIA. WER STEHT HINTER DEM SIA? Impact Hub Vienna Team + Volunteer Team + Unsere Partner Gegründet wurde der Social Impact Award im Jahr 2009 von der WU Wien und seit dem koordiniert vom Team des Impact Hub Vienna. Der Award findet 2016 in insgesamt 11 Ländern statt und erstreckt sich dabei vom europäischen bis zum asiatischen Raum. Soziale Projekte wie diese sind zumeist auf die Unterstützung von Partnern angewiesen. In der Erste Stiftung hat der Social Impact Award einen langjährigen Partner gefunden, der den sozialen Blickwinkel teilt. Franz Karl Prüller – von der Erste Stiftung sieht im Social Impact Award ein sogenanntes *window of opportunities* also Fenster der Möglichkeiten – und einen Weg, de Gesellschaft vor einem Crash zu bewahren. Auch beschreibt er Soziales Unternehmertum als „das Sinnvollste das man für die Gesellschaft tun kann!“ Wenn nicht heute, wann dann ? WAS PASSIERT 2016 ? Auch dieses Jahr bietet der SIA ein ganzjähriges Bildungsprogramm an. Dieses begann mit dem Kick-off Event am 14. Januar. Am 27.4. ist die Einreich-Frist für dein Projekt. Bis Ende Februar hast du Zeit erste Ideen und Gedanken zu sammeln, dann beginnen die sogenanntenGet Started Veranstaltungen, die zur Ideen Entwicklung beitragen sollen.Get Concrete Workshops gehen dann schon genauer auf deine Ideen ein und beinhalten sowohl eine Inspiration Tour als auch eine Action Tour. Voraussetzung um am Award teilnehmen zu können ist es, Studierender in Österreich zu sein. Nachdem beim Event alle Informationen an uns gegeben wurden, die ich gerade so schön in Worte verpackt an dich gerichtet habe, ging der Abend in einen offenen Austausch über, bei dem man sich mit anderen Interessierten sowie erfolgreichen Unternehmen austauschen und vernetzen konnte. An einzelnen Tischen entstanden offene Gespräche, denen mann kurz beiwohnen konnte, nur um dann den Tisch sowie Gesprächspartner und Themen zu wechseln. Ein gelungenes Ende der Veranstaltung bot das feine Essen von Deli Bluem begleitet von ganz vielen Pona Getränken, bei dem noch lange geredet, diskutiert und gegenseitig inspiriert wurde. Auch ich empfand das Event als sehr gelungen und vor allem inspirierend. Die vielen Beispiel-Unternehmen machen einmal mehr Mut. Sie beweisen, dass alles schaffbar ist, wenn man nur daran glaubt.

"22","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/02/23/meine-leidenschaft-wird-mich-noch-sehr-weit-bringen/","ImpactHub","“Meine Leidenschaft wird mich noch sehr weit bringen”","Thomas Kügerl kommt aus dem 450 Einwohnerdorf Stuben im Südburgenland. Das Studium der Wirtschaftsinformatik hat ihn nach Wien geführt. Mit 24 Jahren, unmittelbar nach dem Studium hat Thomas schon seine erste Firma mobile nachhilfe eine Nachhilfelehrer-Vermittlungsplattform, erfolgreich aufgebaut. Seit 2008 ist er zusätzlich im Bereich Online Marketing tätig. Seine Leidenschaft Sport kombiniert Thomas mit der Leidenschaft neue Projekte in die Welt zu rufen und umzusetzen hat ihn dazu bewogen eine sinnstiftende Organisation, namens SOCIAL FRIENDS, zur Förderung von jungen Behindertensportlern zu gründen. SOCIAL FRIENDS wurde 2014 Social Impact Award Sieger. SOCIAL FRIENDS fördert 8 junge österreichische behinderte Leistungssportler im PR Bereich und finanziert Projekte im Breitensport. Im Zuge des Projekts sind Events wie der SocialMan – Austrian Extreme Triathlon und ein Charity Run entstanden. Das Projekt erfährt immer mehr Zuspruch und darf sich mittlerweile über prominente Unterstützer wie z.B.: Marcel Hirscher, Mario Stecher, Peter Hackmair u.w. freuen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt dich an? Mich treibt eine unternehmerische Leidenschaft an, neue Ideen und Projekte umzusetzen, die es in dieser Form zuvor noch nicht gegeben hat. Es reizt mich ungemein in diesen Projekten neue Erfahrungen zu sammeln, Herausforderungen zu meistern und kreative Wege zum Projektziel zu suchen und zu finden. Wann hast du deine Leidenschaft für das was du gerade machst entdeckt? Wo hast du von dieser Idee erfahren? Die unternehmerische Leidenschaft war schon immer in mir. Mit 18 Jahren im Gymnasium wusste ich bereits, dass ich später einmal selbständig sein werde. Welche Projekte das tatsächlich sein werden, wusste ich allerdings noch nicht. Die SOCIAL FRIENDS Idee hat mich bei einem Radurlaub alleine auf Teneriffa gefunden. Eine Idee die mir emotional sehr nahe gegangen ist hat mir die Motivation und Energie für die Umsetzung gegeben. Wie hat deine Leidenschaft dein Leben verändert? Seit meinem Studium lebe ich meine Leidenschaft zu 100%. Das Wort Arbeit in dem Sinn gibt es für mich nicht mehr. Die „Arbeit“ ist zu meinem Leben geworden. Eine klassische Wochenteilung zwischen Wochenende und Arbeitswoche gibt es für mich nicht. Das Ausleben meiner Leidenschaft hat sich extrem positiv auf mich und meine persönliche Entwicklung ausgewirkt. Worauf verzichtest du um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Hmm. Eigentlich verzichte ich auf nichts. Wohin wird dich deine Leidenschaft noch bringen? Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass mich meine Leidenschaft noch sehr weit bringen wird. Sobald man die Leidenschaft einmal entdeckt hat und lebt merken alle rund um dich diesen speziellen Antrieb. Es geht einfach viel mehr weiter und man kann tatsächlich Unmögliches möglich machen. Durchs Ausleben der Leidenschaft werde ich persönlich noch sehr viel dazulernen und die Non-Profit Organisation weiter wachsen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei deiner Arbeit? Das schönste bei meiner „Arbeit“ ist, dass man sich selbstverwirklichen kann, dabei etwas Sinnvolles erschafft und andere Menschen davon profitieren. Also eine WIN WIN Situation. Wer sind deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Das ist vor allem mein Freundeskreis, der aus vielen unterschiedlichen Charakteren, Bildungsniveaus und Einkommensschichten besteht. Diese vermitteln mir in Gesprächen sehr unterschiedliche Sichtweisen aufs Projekt und wichtige Inputs, die für den Projekterfolg wichtig sind. Vom Kritiker, Motivator bis zum Träumer ist da alles dabei. Das ist für mich wichtig und gut so. Wer baut auf dich, wenn es einmal nicht so gut klappt? Meine Freundin, engster Freundeskreis und Familie. Wie gelingt es dir immer wieder Menschen für deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Die Leute spüren das Feuer, das in einem brennt. Es steckt an. Was sagen eigentlich deine Freunde, deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Viele sagen, dass es toll ist. Anfangs wird man sicherlich ein wenig belächelt und vielleicht auch sogar für verrückt erklärt. Aber das ist denke ich normal bis konkrete Ergebnisse und der Benefit zu sehen ist. Was andere darüber denken und sagen ist mir nicht so wichtig. Hast du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? 1. die eigene Leidenschaft entdecken 2. den Mut haben die eigene Leidenschaft mit viel Spaß und Durchhaltevermögen umzusetzen Was treibt dich an immer wieder neue Projekte zu starten? Sicherlich die Neugier etwas Neues zu machen und zu erschaffen. Nach einem erfolgreichen Projektabschluss suche ich mir neue Herausforderungen. Hast du einen Wunsch? Ja. SOCIAL FRIENDS soll eine international tätige Organisation werden, die viel bewegt und dabei viele junge behinderte Menschen unterstützt. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Unsere Leidenschaft <U+0001F609> Hast du für unsere Leser eine Buchempfehlung, einen webTipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Patz? Ich bin ganz und gar kein Bücherwurm. Dennoch kann ich eines empfehlen: „Träume verändern“ von Peter Hackmair. Peter erzählt davon wie sich Träume im Laufe des Lebens durch gewollte oder ungewollte Ereignisse verändern können. Spannend. Als inspirierenden Platz kann ich den Gipfel des Berges Teide auf Teneriffa empfehlen. Von dort aus hat man einen traumhaften Weitblick. Was ich sonst noch erzählen möchte? Für unsere Behindertensportler suchen wir ehrenamtliche Redakteure.

"23","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/02/25/design-thinking-with-ibm/","ImpactHub","Design Thinking with IBM","An overall customer driven strategy, customer intimacy and loyalty can make or break a startup in today’s world. 42% of start ups fail because they are not solving a market problem¹. Do you need more reasons to focus on the humans forming these markets? Design Thinking is a way to tackle problems by focusing on users’ needs and provides a tool for practical and creative problem solving. It is known for the ability to structure the way you approach situations and find efficient solutions. Design is understood as the “intent behind an outcome”² because innovation is never just scratching on the surface. If you are not familiar with Design Thinking we highly recommend you to watch this video by IBM: But how do you translate Design Thinking into specific action? We tackled this question in a workshop on customer and community engagement. The workshop was sponsored by IBM as part of a Social Media Strategy Planning grant they provided to Impact Hub Vienna. Hosted by Andra Muresanu, enthusiast for digital innovation and Klaus Kornfeld, UX Consultant from IBM, the workshop gave valuable insights on how human-centered design can help in developing innovative solutions. A number of Impact Hub Vienna Members participated in the workshop, they were joined by creative minds from the Accelerate Program, Social Impact Start and the Scaling Program. Here are some learnings from the workshop on Design Thinking: Learning 1: Always put the users’ needs in the center There are many ways to prioritize goals and there are even more ways to realize ideas. This is about putting your users’ need in the center of your actions. Use this approach as a frame and integrate it into your daily work structure, especially whenever your machines are standing still. Learning 2: Create buyer personas Some entrepreneurs have it, some don´t. Creating a buyer persona is a project without an external deadline, which means it is likely to just push it aside. In the swirl of everyday work it is easy to discuss hundreds of ideas and thoughts without creating a benefit for your work. A buyer persona gives your team a model of your target group. If you have to reconsider a thousand details and potential scenarios, you have to invest a lot of time and energy with every decision you make. The buyer persona, let´s call her Anna, helps you to stay focused and replaces an unspecific feeling for your target groups, with a fictional model costumer. Whenever you face decision it is easier for you and your team to ask yourself how to improve the situation for Anna instead of losing the creative momentum in a discussion about your target group. Learning 3: Know your data A good buyer persona is the base and reference system when setting your compass in costumer- and community oriented approaches. So the one big advice is: Analyse, analyse, analyse. It is no secret that the better you know your target groups, the better you can understand them. Don´t let quantitative data from facebook insights or google analytics be your only source for that. Invest some time! Talk to your users. Get a picture of what they are doing. Don´t forget: Everyone in your team knows one of your costumers in a different situation – a potential not to be wasted. How does Anna feel when she comes home from work? Is she looking for new opportunities in life? How old is she, where does she work, what attributes does she have? Is she sporty? Is she on instagram? Is she married? Does she have a pet? Which media does she consume? Paint a clear picture of a person. Empathy is key here. IBM presented the following dimensions to structure the personality of your buyer persona: What does she say? What does she think? What is she doing? How does she feel? Start with your most important target group and repeat this for every target group you can identify. Learning 4: Break it down! Define a time frame and break the journey of your buyer persona down into single steps and visualize them. How does she feel in this situation? What is she thinking? And what is she doing during every single step? Sure, there are multiple ways that lead to Rome for your costumer. Chose one. This will help you to identify tensions the user may have and enables you to improve. Learning 5: Identify your costumer’s pain points! Stay focused on the big problems and don´t lose yourself on features of the website or small improvements. The question to ask is:“What ideas are easy to implement and have the biggest impact on your business?” This could be a negative emotional situation for the user, a technological gap which stops Anna in her flow or just the (missing) knowledge about your product. Let your creative juices flow and use your collective brain power to develop ideas to tackle specific problems. Whenever you get stuck ion a problem or question, and this will happen, don´t let this stop you. You have to keep going, unfortunately there is no single question to ask when searching for a solution however “What matters most?“or “What is more efficient?“ are a good place to start. Choose the idea that is easy to implement and at the same time has the biggest impact on the pain points. There are no perfect solutions, so don´t waste your teams energy searching for it. Keep the momentum! A final word of advice… Put your smartphone and laptop away before you start. Grab a pen and paper. Not only does this add to a more communicative situation but also helps you stay focused. Buy tons of post-its and a whiteboard and it will change the way you work! With these learnings it will be much easier to design a costumer-centered strategy and assures you don’t miss their needs.

That’s why we challegend ‘Dwarfs and Giants’ at their office at Impact Hub Vienna to predict the future of business. In the end, we learned that we might not want to predict the future after all. Why? We’ll, let ‘Dwarfs and Giants’ explain that to you. What is the founding story of ‘Dwarfs and Giants? Sascha Bernardis: “Four consultants decided to leave their old company to experience new ways of organizing, that was the beginning of Dwarfs and Giants. One of the most important ideas in the beginning was how to become unimportant for the company as a founder. Normally founders are very important especially for a Start Up. But we were thrilled by the idea to become in the most effective way unimportant. That’s why we said: let’s go with Holacracy, because then we do not delegate but distribute authority and let’s do a purpose quest to find the purpose we want to bring together to the world. Our purpose is rewriting the future of organisation and catalyzing the evolution of wholesome organisations. So that’s what we do today!” How are you prototyping the future of business? What is the change you want to make? Christiane Seuhs-Schoeller: “We are supporting the shift towards wholesome organisations, meaning that people who work in an organisation can truly show up whole and therefore develop their entire and full potential in order to contribute to something that is bigger than themselves – which is the purpose of on organisation. It’s about having purpose driven organisations to do what is important for the world.” What is the one thing that helps you prepare for the future? Tell us about Impact Hub Vienna and how it has impacted your enterprise. What is ‘Holacracy’? What are the benefits of ‘Holacracy’? Christiane Seuhs-Schoeller: “Over the course of the last decade, especially after 2008/2009 there has been visible and dramatically increasing amount of people disconnected with what they do: loneliness, sicknesses, depression and burn-out, coming from the feeling that work is senseless and has a lack of identification is the result. Apparently there is a general shift of consciousness happening, starting in some societies of the world. And if we look for example at Frederic Laloux’s book of “Reinventing Organizations” we can clearly read how with every conscious shift in society organisations shift along with it, because it needs a new form of organising. That is where ‘Holacracy’ comes in as one form of organising. Until now, it is the only one that is scalable across almost every organisation that is willing to go through that shift. Because of the purpose driven mode that you need, the clear goal is to align everything in the organisation to the purpose. That really makes a complete difference for people because they then have a different sense of identification and sense in what they’re doing, by aligning to the purpose of the organisation. Through the purpose the organisation is anchored in society, because the purpose is the answer to what the society wants the organisation to be and the organisation answers the question ‘what do I want to be in society?’. That’s why we believe, in the not so distant future every business needs to be purpose driven and therefore socially responsible.” What advice would you give to someone to help them achieve their dreams?","March 2, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/next-land-MAP_front-600x400.jpeg"

Every business should be affected by the future of business, but Start Ups and Social Entrepreneurs as role models in this field encounter various difficulties, but also benefit from being a strongly connected community. We asked our members at Impact Hub Vienna how they deal with change and what they contribute to the future of business. Nikolaus Hutter- New Paradigm Ventures and Angello “The future of business is … a new economic paradigm of how we produce, consume, work… generally, how we organise the allocation of our resources. It permeates all levels – the why, the what and the how. Business purpose (the why) will change from narrow focus for the few (profit maximisation for shareholders) to broader purpose for many (maximising impact – and well-being – for all stakeholders). This will result in a shift towards products and services that satisfy genuine needs, rather than create ever-new wants (the what): These will be offered by organisations whose mode of operation is in line with – rather than at the expense of – what we value in life (the how): harmony with others and nature, a shared purpose greater than our individual selves, collaboration with others resulting in meaningful relationships, and the possibility to grow and fulfil our potential.” What is the change you want to make? “My goal is to help create an economic model so that the terms social entrepreneur and impact investor are as pleonastically redundant as the adjectives in “dark night”, “cold ice”, “wet water “etc. In the future, there will only be entrepreneurs and investors, who either create value – financial, social, and environmental – or go out of business.” In your personal routines and habits what is one thing that helps you prepare for the future? “Apart from the obvious like a daily 2hr morning meditation, barefoot runs in the Vienna Woods, eating a gluten-and lactose-free paleo diet, and keeping up with the latest sustainability and mindfulness research, I just try and enjoy whatever I do – in my honest opinion a key part in living the new how in the here-and-now.” Ana Barros- Instagram Influencer and Co- Founder of Better How will the future of business look like? “Thinking of businesses as they are today, most still depend on hierarchical structures. I believe that there will be no bosses in the future and we can all be freelancers.” Sebastian Rahs and Rainer Wachter- Woodsaw As a business, how are you prototyping the future of business?“By inventing new combined professions.” In your personal routines and habits, what is one thing that helps you prepare for the future?“To extend our skills in all directions.” The future of business is…versatility.” Simon Schmitz- Awattar How do you see the future of business?“The future of business lies in what we need most as a society: justice and a healthy natural environment. To avoid dangerous climate change, we need to sync our energy use with nature. The tools are there (like software). So are the obstacles (such as grown institutions). And business will always be about getting the job done to overcome them.” Anna Iarotska- Robo Wunderkind As a business, how are you prototyping the future of business? “One thing that is going to shape the future of entrepreneurship is impermanence and constant reconfiguration. Change is unavoidable and happening at a fast pace. I believe it is crucial for every business to stay flexible and adapt to those developments. What has been always very helpful for our Robo Wunderkind team: we have a very mixed skill set. We are all coming from different backgrounds and bring in different perspectives.

Er hatte das Glück, seine ersten beruflichen Sporen bei einem sehr erfolgreichen Start Up zu verdienen. Dessen Wachstum von null auf 40 % Marktanteil war für Martin eine sehr interessante und prägende Zeit die verdeutlichte, was ein engagiertes Team alles erreichen kann. In den darauffolgenden Jahren konnte Martin Wesian in Südamerika und Asien als Rucksacktourist, Restaurantbetreiber und Tauchlehrer den Unterschied zwischen Arm und Reich hautnah miterleben. Schlussendlich arbeitete er mehrere Jahre in Wien im Kunst- Kulturbereich, quasi der Gegenpol von Armut. HELIOZ versucht nun die Diskrepanz zwischen Arm und Reich zumindest im Kleinen zu schliessen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt dich an? Veränderung, Verbesserung, Wandel. Der Status Quo ist meist nicht akzeptabel oder zumindest verbesserungswürdig. Wann hast du die Ideen für HELIOZ für dich entdeckt? Der Keim dazu wurde wohl durch meine Erkrankung an Cholera in Südamerika gepflanzt. Ich habe innerhalb von 2 Wochen über 15 kg an Gewicht verloren, was ich als wohlgenährter Europäer relativ gut wegstecken konnte. Wenn Kinder 20% ihres Gewichts verlieren, schaut die Sache wiederum ganz anders aus. Prägend war, dass ich mir während meiner Cholera Erkrankung einen Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung ermöglichen konnte, welche meinen Freunden vor Ort nicht möglich war. Die Diskrepanz zwischen der lokalen Bevölkerung und meinem privilegierten Zugang als Europäer ist mir damals erst richtig bewusst geworden. Alleine durch den Vorteil meines Geburtsortes standen mir Möglichkeiten offen, die den Menschen vor Ort verwehrt waren. Warum gerade dieses Projekt? Es kann doch einfach nicht sein, dass in unserer hochtechnologisierten Welt die Ärmsten der Armen immer noch wegen verschmutzen Wasser sterben. Es sterben mehr Kinder durch wasserbedingte Durchfallerkrankungen, als an Malaria, AIDS und Masern zusammen. Unfassbare 2000 Kinder pro Tag. Während zur Lösung von Malaria und AIDS Unsummen investiert werden, gibt es kaum Innovationen für einfach zu vermeidende Infektionen, die durch Wasser hervorgerufen werden. Deshalb: Althergebrachte Lösungen wie Abkochen, Chlor und Filter konnten das Problem in den letzten 50 Jahren nicht zum Besseren wenden und sie passen auch nicht zu den Bedürfnissen und Möglichkeiten der Menschen. Eine neue, disruptive Lösung ist notwendig. Wo findest du den Raum um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In Gesprächen, in meinem Kopf, im Austausch mit dem Team und in unseren Projekten. Worauf verzichtest du, um deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Leider gehört die Reduzierung von Freizeit, sozialen Kontakten, Sport und Kultur zum Ausleben solch einer Leidenschaft dazu. Ein Schicksal, welches aber wohl den meisten Gründern bekannt ist, unabhängig der Art des Start ups. Persönlicher Einsatz ist notwendig, macht aber auch Spass und kann auch erfüllend sein. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei deiner Arbeit? Die schönsten Momente erlebe ich während den Aufenthalten in unseren Zielländern. Der Austausch mit den Menschen in Afrika oder Asien und deren Probleme, aber auch vor allem deren (Lebens-) Weisheiten und Lebensfreude sind immer wieder beeindruckend. Wer sind deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Nicht notwendigerweise in dieser Reihenfolge bzw. wechselnd: Sohn, Team, Investoren, Kunden, Freunde. Wer baut dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Am besten abschalten kann ich wenn ich mit meinem 3 jährigen Kleinen unterwegs bin, da ihn meine alltäglichen Probleme nicht interessieren. Er beschäftigt sich mit der Entdeckung seiner Welt – und er nimmt mich jedes Mal mit auf seine Entdeckungsreise. Wohin wird dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Wohin mich persönlich diese Arbeit bringt, wird sich noch zeigen. Entweder ende ich als Sozialfall, oder als Mitarbeiter eines sehr coolen Unternehmens, welches sich den dringendsten Problemen der Welt annimmt und leistbare Lösungen dafür entwickelt. Viel interessanter ist aber die Frage, wohin die Arbeit von HELIOZ führen wird? HELIOZ wird in der Branche bereits jetzt als Know how Träger und gewichtiger Player wahrgenommen. Nun gilt es, dass Ganze in ein ökonomisch gut funktionierendes Modell zu überführen, um eine Teilnahme am internationalen Diskurs auch finanziell tragen zu können. Was würdest du machen, wenn es Helioz nicht geben würde? Ich hätte vermutlich meine vorherige Tätigkeit im Kunst- Kulturmanagement weitergeführt, jedoch unterbrochen durch Einsätze im Bereich der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit. Im Jahr 2010 hatte ich ein Wochenende, in dem ich vor der Entscheidung stand HELIOZ zu gründen, oder einen Einsatz für Ärzte ohne Grenzen zu absolvieren. Letzteres hätte mich sehr gereizt und mir auch einiges an Know how allgemein und für die heutige Arbeit vermittelt. Nach einem Wochenende mit wenig Schlaf ist es doch HELIOZ geworden <U+0001F609> Gibt es bestimmte Themen die dich besonders interessieren? Politik, soziale Ungerechtigkeit, Kunst&Kultur. Wie gelingt es dir immer wieder Menschen für deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Keine Ahnung! Ich weiss auch nicht ob ich begeistern kann, oder ob es das WADI ist. Ich reflektiere und präsentiere meine Erfahrungen sowie meine tiefe Überzeugung, dass eine bessere Welt möglich ist. Aber Hauptsache es begeistert und bringt die Sache vorwärts. Was sagen eigentlich deine Freunde, dein Umfeld, deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Super; Such dir einen gscheiten Job; Mach weiter so; Warum hast du nie Zeit?; … Hast du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ob ich den LeserInnen Tipps geben kann sei dahingestellt, aber zwei Sachen habe ich von HELIOZ gelernt: 1. Gerade wir inMitteleuropa sollten uns öfter vor Augen führen, in welch privilegierten Umfeld wir geboren wurden. Nicht die Angst vor einer Verschlechterung unserer Lebenssituation sollte uns antreiben, sondern die Verbesserung der Lebenssituation anderer sollte unser Ziel sein. 2. Ich glaube jede und jeder kann GründerIn sein bzw. ist es bereits. Wer hat sich noch nicht über Produkte, Lösungen oder Dienstleistungen geärgert, weil sie unpraktisch waren oder schlicht fehlten? Der einzige Schritt zum Gründen ist es an sich zu glauben und die bessere oder neue Lösung zu etablieren. Ein Versuch ist es immer Wert, scheitern ist nur eine Alternative. Hast du einen Wunsch? Allgemein wäre es schön zu sehen, wenn der Fokus auf den eigenen Vorteil nicht im Vordergrund stehen würde, da er meist nur zu Lasten anderer möglich ist. Kant hat es am treffendsten formuliert: “Handle nur nach derjenigen Maxime, durch die du zugleich wollen kannst, dass sie ein allgemeines Gesetz werde”. www.helioz.org","March 7, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HELIOZ_MartinWesian_02-600x400.jpg"

Zum Studieren ist er nach Wien gekommen und picken geblieben. Stefan mag Berge, Cafés und ab und zu ein Wiener Schnitzel. Und mit FragNebenan baut er sich gerade das Unternehmen auf, in dem er schon immer arbeiten wollte. FragNebenan ist ein soziales Netzwerk für Nachbarinnen und Nachbarn. Es geht darum miteinander in Kontakt zu kommen, sich auszutauschen und Nachbarschaftshilfe zu organisieren. Es soll dazu beitragen, dass Nachbarschaft zu einer Gemeinschaft wird. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Ich möchte etwas Sinnvolles tun. Meine Zeit, meine Energie, mein Geld in Etwas investieren, an das ich glaube. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für dieses Projekt entdeckt? Vor etwa zweieinhalb Jahren. Ich hatte gerade meinen alten Job aufgegeben. Eine längere Reise hinter mir. Eine Brandeins-Ausgabe über die Sharing Economy gelesen. Und bei einer Wanderung mit einem Kumpel länger darüber geredet, dass es cool wäre, im Freundeskreis eine Art Verleihkreis aufzubauen. Passiert ist es dann aber in meinem Stiegenhaus. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Ich hatte wieder mal nur „Hallo“ zu einem meiner Nachbarn gesagt. Und mir gedacht, dass es seltsam ist, dass wir zwar unter einem Dach wohnen – uns aber überhaupt nicht kennen. Und warum ist es dann FragNebenan geworden? Weil sich hier der Verleihkreis und das Gefühl, dass man in der Nachbarschaft auch anders zusammenleben könnte, für mich verbunden haben. Und je länger ich über die Idee nachgedacht habe, desto klarer ist mir geworden, dass in der Nachbarschaft ein riesiges Potenzial steckt, uns den Alltag einfacher zu machen und uns mehr zu Hause zu fühlen. Und dass dieses Potenzial nur in ganz seltenen Fällen genutzt wird. Was würdest Du eigentlich tun, wenn es FragNebenan nicht geben würde? Ich wollte immer im Medienbereich arbeiten. Für ein Medium, das richtigen Journalismus macht. Und dass ich selber gerne lese. Ich war auch gerade am Bewerbungsschreiben schreiben als ich begann, über FragNebenan nachzudenken. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Auf der Welt haben wir noch nicht all zu viele Spuren hinterlassen. Aber wir arbeiten dran. In Wien würden uns aber glaub ich schon einige Nachbarinnen und Nachbarn vermissen. Und darauf sind wir ziemlich stolz. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In unserem Büro. Bei Nachbarschaftstreffen. In einem meiner Lieblingscafés. Bei den vielen Gesprächen, die sich ergeben, seit sich das mit FragNebenan ergeben hat. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Früher war ich öfter in den Bergen. Meine Freunde hab ich auch öfter gesehen. Länger verreisen war auch schon einmal einfacher als heute <U+0001F609> Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das wir mit Menschen zu tun haben. Aus allen Altersgruppen. Mit den unterschiedlichsten Berufen. Und jeder Menge Geschichten. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Andreas, Mathias und Valentin. Wir haben FragNebenan von Anfang an gemeinsam aufgebaut. Und haben auch alle Rückschläge gemeinsam weggesteckt. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir wollen FragNebenan bald in andere Städte und Länder bringen. Damit werden wir ein Zeiterl zu tun haben. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Hab das Gefühl, dass ich damit wenig zu tun habe. Es ist eher die Idee, die die Leute begeistert. Weil in ihr so viele Möglichkeiten stecken, den Alltag leichter und das Zusammenleben schöner zu machen. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Soweit ich das mitbekomme sind alle sehr stolz auf das, was wir aufgebaut haben. Und mittlerweile glaubt auch meine 82-jährige Oma daran, dass aus FragNebenan etwas werden kann. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Podcast hören. Mein aktueller Favorit ist „Planet Money“ von NPR: http://www.npr.org/sections/money – Sehr gut recherchierte, sehr gut erzählte Geschichten rund um die Wirtschaft. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Ja, bitte bei FragNebenan anmelden. Und auch gleich alle Freunde und Nachbarn dazu einladen","March 10, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/109.264.287-600x400.jpeg"

Creating interactive and meaningful and not too long and motivating and effective settings with 150 or more people in the room is often required and can be a challenge due to time requirements, participants that don’t know each other… World Café is one of the methodologies I often go back to in this case, as it allows for exploring a topic openly, from many different angles in a relatively safe setting with a certain timeframe. So how does it work? For a World Café, participants sit in small groups, often around tables that have paper or flipchart “tablecloths” with markers lying on them. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, which can even be supported by coffee and drinks being available and/or served during the process. Participants are invited to explore and exchange thoughts on a given topic or question over several rounds following a certain “Café Etiquette” that encourages active listening, speaking the essence and doodling on the paper tablecloths in front of them so as to document the thought process of the group. One person is the “table host” and his/her role is to moderate the discussion if necessary and encourage people who are rather quiet to contribute. After every round the “table host” stays on the table while the others switch and find a new group to explore further. The ”table host” gives the newcomers a short summary of the previous discussion on the start of the next round. This allows for the newly formed group to build on the insights of the previous round thus enabling a deepening of the dialog while simultaneously understanding again new and different perspectives. The last step in a World Café is to bring together the main insights from each table and share them with the whole group. And where can this be used? I have seen World Cafes in small traditional Tyrolean mountain huts with 20 people, on a conference with 150 economic researchers as well as 500 people sitting on a town square in Cluj, Romania. It is a versatile and effective format that really allows for the collective interests and ideas of the group to emerge.","March 10, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/F1w3O7q5nUBtNtiRZ-J22ewPgxA6SbZDf78WKc53smY-600x400.jpeg"
"29","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/03/11/optimizing-your-day-2-day-life-with-matthias-reisinger/","ImpactHub","Optimizing your Day 2 Day life with Matthias Reisinger","Optimizing your Day 2 Day life with Matthias Reisinger This months skill share breakfast saw Matthias Reisinger, Co-founder & Director of the Impact Hub Vienna and efficiency guru, sharing some of his personal tips, tricks and apps that he uses every day. The event was very popular, and had to be expanded to deal with the increased interest. The event saw Matthias deliver some very valuable knowledge on how to integrate apps and shortcuts into one’s daily working life. This blog post will recap some of the apps he covered in the event. The apps he covered: Evernote Evernote is a cross-platform app designed to organise and structure your notes, to do lists, reminders and more. Matthias emphasized that it is key to fully commit to using Evernote for everything. Once you have fully committed to using it will make everything more simple by storing everything in one place. The next step is to work out how you want to structure your work. As Matthias has lots of different roles with Impact Hub Vienna he structures it in such a way that groups his work together. So when he is working in one role he can find all the information and to do lists that are associated with that role. Another clever trick Matthias demonstrated is the linking of other notes within Evernote. This linking process simplifies the work flow and makes it easier to connect one note to another, meaning you never waste time searching for notes, this helps you reach a ‘flow state’ as you quickly move from one task to another. Note link can be achieved in the Evernote app on your computer by right clicking a note, on the web version this function can be found at the top of the note. This link can be added to other locations, such as calendar, email, to do lists etc, helping you streamline your working process in all locations. Price: Evernote Basic is free, Plus is €19.99 per year and Premium is €39.99 per year. More information can be found here. OmniFocus OmniFocus is a very powerful task management tool based on the principles of ‘Getting things done‘. Matthias highlights numerous features of OmniFocus that he uses every day. It gives you the ability to add tasks from anywhere on your computer using a quick shortcut, be that from an email, a webpage or somewhere else. It simplifies the task adding process by automatically filing certain fields, for example the title of an email becomes the title of the task and the highlighted text becomes the content. It also includes an automatic link to the URL so you can go directly to the email or anywhere else when you need it. Another benefit of OmniFocus is that is it lets you view your work in a number of ways, or ‘perspectives’. Matthias highlights that this can be used to allocate tasks to specific locations or scenarios, For example when you are at work, at home or connected to the internet. Omni Focus then displays the tasks that are relevent to your current situation. This makes it easier to shift focus and only work on the tasks that relevent at that time. On top of this with the OmniFocus app you will be notified, via Location Settings, to which location you are near and there which tasks you can complete.OmniFocus also has a built in review tool, this enables a task to be scheduled for a later date. Meaning it will show you the tasks that are the most urgent, and will schedule others for later. Overall OmniFocus is a great tool to help you focus on the most important task at hand, taking into account your current location and situation. It really can help you streamline your working life as you always know what the next task is as it helps you prioritise your work. More information can be found here. MailPlane MailPlane is an app for mac which hosts your gmail account in a separate window to your browsers. Matthias explained a number of benefits of using MailPlane. Its main benefit is how it can link with other apps. As it operates using Apples default code language it is easy to integrate it with OmniFocus or other apps such as Alfred. This can help you streamline your working processes using short cuts meaning you can find emails, create tasks and work more efficiently. More information can be found here. TextExpander This tool drew a lot of interest from the attendees of the breakfast. Matthias demonstrated how this tool can save you time and make you faster and more efficient when answering emails, typing text and more. Text expander takes short cuts that you predefine and writes full texts for you. The example Matthias used was writing the address of Impact Hub Vienna. Impact Hub Vienna Lindengasse 56 1070 Wien Austria Now this doesn’t seem to take so long, however if you have to write this out 10 times a day the time adds up. The short cut Matthias uses? ;ihadd. Then the app does the hard work for you. The app also allows the use of drop downs and editable text with in short cut. Another example Matthias used was writing the description of Impact Hub Vienna. As this is text he often has to write, and he needs to meet the brand image as it is important there is consistency with this message. Also at times there is a requirement for a long, short or very short description, depending on the intended use for the text. TextExpander gives you flexibility to select which description you want. When Matthias types ;ihdescrip a pop up comes up like the one shown here. Then you just have to select which version of the text you want. This not only saves time as you don’t have to find the text and copy and paste it, but it ensures you are consistent in your message. Another powerful customisation possible in TextExpander is the ability to customise a pre-written text using drop downs, input text fields or optional extra text segments, such as inviting someone for coffee. Functions which can be seen in the image. On top of all of this the app will recommend certain chunks of text for snippeting, meaning if you type something frequently the app will realise and actually recommend you develop a short cut for it. Find out more here. Alfred Alfred is another app for Mac. This app replaces and far surpasses the built in Spotlight search function that is built into every Mac product. This app performs everything the Spotlight does, searching your Mac and searching documents with in your Mac, however Matthias highlights that it is what Alfred does extra that really makes it a must have app for example being apple to complete calculations. With the premium version it becomes much more powerful. It has the ability to launch programs, search specific websites, play music and much, much more. But what makes Alfred so great is that all this is performed with hotkeys and text. Making it very fast an efficient to use. More can be found here. Contactually Contactually is a great app for monitoring and maintaining important relationships, both in business and personally. By categorising your contacts into buckets (groups of similar contacts), you enable Contactually to take care of the rest. It will remind you when to follow up, how any prior interactions went, or what to say to break the ice. With regular follow-up like this, you’ll soon realise you have fewer forgotten connections, and more engaged relationships. Find out more here. 1Password Matthias asked the attendees of the event ‘Do you have one password for everything?’ They answer ‘yes’ Matthias then asked ‘Is it secure?’ The answer to this is obviously no. If one account gets hacked they are all open for the Hackers. So the safe thing is to use different and complex passwords for everything, but then you have the challenge to remember them all. 1Password aims to solve this problem. It is a secure, encrypted location for all of you passwords. You just have to remember one key password, which will allow access to all of the others. Your passwords are, encrypted, password protected and stored locally on your laptop, so no need to worry about someone hacking them in The Cloud. 1Password integrates into your browser making it simple and easy to use. You just have to remember that one password to have access to all your passwords to all your accounts. Find out more here. Matthias covered a lot in the short time he had but there were a number of apps he wanted to talk about but didn’t have time to cover in full. Here is a summary of the apps he didn’t get time to cover and the key points of each one. Fantastical Fantastical is a Calendar app for Mac which allows you to schedule meetings, events and reminders using natural language, meaning you can write ‘Lunch at 4 tomorrow with Mike’ and it will translate that into a calendar appointment. It automatically recognises locations and can send invites to your contacts. Naturally it integrates with most existing calendar apps and it places a widget on your Apple Widget Screen. Find out more here. Flycut Enables you to copy and paste up to 40 snippets. Its saves them in a tool in your task bar. It is a open source product based on ‘JumpCut’. This open source model makes it free and customisable. This tool means you can copy and paste lots of different pieces of information without fear of losing something you copied earlier. Find out more here. FullContact FullContact is a contact management tool, offering both a free and a paid version. It gives you the ability to manage you contacts in a simplified yet more detailed way. With the premium account you can photograph a business card, which will be transcribed by a person, ensuring no computer error, and then entered into your contacts. It finds public information on people and collects it all in one place and it can create contacts from email signatures, saving you time and effort. Find out more here. Whats App for Web Whats App for Web allows you to access your Whats App from your phone via your Laptop. For this to work you need to have Whats App installed on your phone and attached to the internet. This simplifies communication because you can do it all from one device, your laptop, and not have to keep switching between phone and laptop. Find out more here. DirectMail Direct Mail is an easy to use newsletter app for Mac. It makes it easy to create and send newsletters with an attractive aesthetic. It also allows you to track open rates, collaborate with your team and set up automatic messages. Find out more here.

Pocket Pockets lets you save anything that you read on your computer so you can read it at a later date. It can be read on your phone, laptop or tablet. Its integration is simple and effective and makes sure you never lose that interesting article again. Find out more here. Matthias rounded up his presentation by summarising the key points when using new programs, short cuts or widgets. ‘It is important to remain patient and ensure all shortcuts and tools are customised to your style of work.’ By knowing how you work before trying to incorporate new tools, shortcuts or widgets, you can customise your tools to get the best out of them. He also emphasized the importance of integrating new tools gradually, this way you really get to know how they work and what they are good for. If you install everything on this list at once the likelihood is you won’t use all of them because you will be overwhelmed. His advice was to take it slow and really get to know how the tools work so you can get the best out of them.","March 11, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stressed-with-text-2-600x400.jpg"
"30","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/03/13/perrine-schober-das-soziale-ist-meine-welt/","ImpactHub","Perrine Schober: “Das Soziale ist meine Welt”","Perrine Schober ist 32 Jahre alt. Sie ist halb Französin und halb Österreicherin und hat Tourismus Management in Deutschland studiert. Während ihres Erasmus-Semesters in England hat sie sich auf “Tourismus als volkswirtschaftliches Instrument der Armutsverringerung” spezialisiert und anschließend für unterschiedliche Entwicklungshilfeorganisationen im Ausland gearbeitet. SHADES TOURS ist ein Hybrid zwischen der Sozialwirtschaft und dem Tourismus, es ist ein Social Tourism Business. SHADES TOURS bietet obdachlosen Menschen eine wertschätzende Beschäftigung an, die sie motiviert aktiv an der Gesellschaft und am Arbeitsmarkt teilzunehmen. Es werden dazu Touren zu den unterschiedlichen Wiener Sozialeinrichtungen für Obdachlose angeboten. Das besondere hierbei ist, dass diese selbst von Obdachlosen und EinrichtungsleiterInnen geführt werden. Perrine, wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für „SHADES TOURS” entdeckt? Im Jahr 2014 habe ich meinen Job gekündigt. Ich spürte einen grundlegenden Motivationsverlust und eine kleine Lebenskrise. Ich habe eines Tages einen Persönlichkeitstest zugeschickt bekommen, den 16personalities.com-Test, welcher auf C.G. Jung basiert. Heraus kam, in der Rubrik “Karriere”, dass Marketing und Sales meine persönlichen Stärken sind und dass das Soziale meine Leidenschaft ist. So interpretierte ich es, dass ich vielleicht meine innere Ruhe nur dann finde wenn ich diese Elemente verbinde. Aus der Tourismusbranche und dem Entwicklungshilfesektor kommend, war ich somit auf der Suche nach einem Social Tourism Business Konzept. Wie und wo hast du „SHADES TOURS“ entdeckt? Im Januar 2015 war ich auf der Suche nach Social Tourism Konzepten in Europa und bin auf einen Artikel gestoßen, der „Touren geführt von Obdachlosen“ in Amsterdam, Prag, Barcelona und Berlin präsentierte. Fasziniert von dieser Idee habe ich die Projektleiter angeschrieben, die Touren besucht und mit den örtlichen Guides gesprochen. Aufgrund meiner Kenntnisse aus der Touristik wusste ich, dass einige besuchte Tourenmodelle in Wien nicht möglich sein würden, da diese am Fremdenführergewerbe „kratzen“ könnten. Nach der ersten Konzepterstellung führten mich meine Wege zu den ersten Leitern von Wiener Sozialeinrichtungen. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Der Glaube daran, dass es tatsächlich funktionieren kann, motiviert mich jeden Morgen aufs Neue. Und dass ich dieser Aufgabe sowohl gewachsen, als auch mächtig bin. Das ist ein extrem wichtiges Detail, denn in der Selbstständigkeit gibt es immer wieder Momente des Zweifeilens und, wenn man sich in diesen Momenten diese Sicherheit immer wieder holt, dann gibt es einem die notwendige Motivation zur Implementierung. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Hätte man mir vor 5 Jahren gesagt, dass ich irgendwann mal selbstständig sein und mit Obdachlosen arbeiten würde, so hätte ich es nicht geglaubt. Die Entscheidung SHADES TOURS zu implementieren war sowohl eine rationale als auch emotionale Entscheidung. Der Glaube, dass das Gesamtprojekt (in seiner Gesamtheit mit allen Ober- und Unterzielen) funktionieren kann; die Evaluierung der eigenen Fähigkeiten; und das Wissen, dass es mich mehr Zeit als Geld kosten wird, haben dazu geführt, dass ich mich getraut habe. Hätte es eine hohe Kapitalinvestition benötigt, hätte ich es wahrscheinlich nicht gewagt. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? (Lacht.) Der Welt würde wahrscheinlich nichts abgehen. Mir und den Guides jedoch sehr viel. Den Tourenteilnehmern bietet SHADES TOURS eine Möglichkeit zur Information, Aufklärung und Engagement an–eine unvergessliche und bereichernde Erfahrung. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Nur weil SHADES TOURS meine Leidenschaft und Arbeit gleichzeitig ist, heißt es nicht, dass ich keine normale Gründerin bin. Hierzu zählt, dass ich weniger Zeit für Familie und Freunde investiere, weniger fernsehe, weniger ausgehe, usw. SHADES TOURS ist in jedem meiner Atemzüge und mein ständiger Begleiter. Mit SHADES TOURS verzichte ich auf ein geregeltes Angestelltenverhältnis, auf die Sicherheit eines Gehaltes, auf die Sicherheit mit 18:00 in den Feierabend zu gehen. Aber das sind die Selbstverständlichkeiten, die man auf sich nimmt, wenn man sich für die Selbstständigkeit entscheidet. Somit würde ich nicht sagen, dass ich wirklich auf etwas verzichte. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste an meiner Arbeit ist zu sehen, wie das Projekt Form annimmt und wie jeder Stakeholder darin etwas Positives für sich gewinnt–die Erstellung eines Gemeinschaftsprojektes. Jeder Tag ist einmalig und kein Tag gleicht einem anderen. Tage und Wochen vergehen wie im Flug. Ein Element gehört jedoch zu jedem einzelnen Tag dazu: die Energie und der Elan, die mich in der Früh aus dem Bett kitzeln. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Die, die an mich und SHADES TOURS glauben. Das sind sowohl die Guides, die Einrichtungsleiter, die Sozialträger, aber auch jeder einzelne SHADES TOURS Teilnehmer, der von unserer Arbeit begeistert ist. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Mein Freund, Mentoren und Freunde vom Impact Hub Vienna versuchen mich aufzubauen, wenn ich Sorgen habe. Ich habe jedoch einen Weg gefunden, mich selbst aufzubauen und mir selbst die Sätze aufzusagen, die ich brauche. Das ist mein eigenes kleines Mantra. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Zwar ist es nicht geheim, aber ich habe es noch viel zu selten erwähnt. Ich möchte SHADES TOURS als internationale Marke positionieren, um zukünftigen Social Entrepreneurs das zu bieten, wonach ich vor einem Jahr gesucht hatte. Eine Marke, der man sich mit seinem eigenen Projekt unterstellen und somit seine ganze Kraft in das Operative stecken kann. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Wenn man von seiner Leidenschaft auf einer rationalen und verständlichen Ebene erzählt, so erkennen Zuhörer nicht nur das Leuchten in deinen Augen, sondern verstehen auch den Sinn dahinter. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sehr unterschiedlich. Mein persönliches Umfeld war anfangs sehr skeptisch gegenüber SHADES TOURS. Erst als ich von fachkundigen Einschätzungen erzählen konnte, wurden sie beschwichtigt. Seit dem medialen Rückenwind sind alle begeistert und unterstützend, jedoch weiterhin noch in der Position zu sehen, ob es ein Hobby ist oder ein tatsächlicher Job. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ja klar. 1) Nicht Freunde, Bekannte und Familie nach Einschätzungen fragen, sondern mit fachkundigen Personen sprechen. 2) Sich trauen! Trauen mit fachkundigen Personen Kontakt aufzunehmen (Email an Unbekannte verschicken, Telefonanrufe zu tätigen) und sie bitten sich Zeit zu nehmen, um euren Ideen zu lauschen. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung? Im Moment lese ich „Start something that matters“ von Blake Mycoskie, der Social Entrepreneur von TOMS. Es ist eine angenehme Bett- und U-Bahn-Lektüre, die perfekt in die Gründungsphase von SHADES TOURS passt. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Tobias Judmaier von Iss Mich!

The four speakers, coming from a range of backgrounds and companies, tackled this issue in a concise yet varied way. Presenting using PechaKucha format: 20 seconds per slide for 20 slides, each speaker explored the main topic in relation to their areas of expertise. This innovative presenting format was new for many of the speakers, providing a great learning process for the speakers and the audience. Dietmar Millinger – “Helping volunteers to do good better” Dietmar started the evening addressing the topic, ‘Helping volunteers to do good better.’ He explored this topic using the platform he is currently working to develop. This app will allow charities and NGO’s to release ‘Tickets’ asking for the help they need. For example if they need water they will release 20 Tickets for 2 litre bottles of water. This shows up on ‘Volunteers Feed’ as a call for water bottles. The volunteer then commits to a number of Tickets. After the volunteers have brought 20 bottles of water the ‘Ticket’ has been fulfilled. The aim of this app/platform is to ensure that the NGO’s get the donations they require at the time they need them. It also addresses the issue of wasted donations, which is especially prevalent for food donations. ‘Help Today’ are aiming to make donations more efficient, by getting the right solution to the right place, which will help change the lives of those who really need help. Wnat to know more? Get in contact with Dietmar here. Simon Schmitz – “Being in Sync with Nature“ Simon is the CEO of aWATTar, a power supply company that encourages customers to time their energy usage when there is a surplus of green energy by giving them a monetary incentive. Currently there is a problem with storing energy, so when there is a surplus in green energy (wind and solar) the price of energy drops dramatically, creating a negative cost. The customer however pays the same rate regardless, allowing the energy company to profit massively. aWATTar is hoping to change that system. Last year there was 100 hours where the energy cost was negative. aWATTar is the first company to transfer this profit to the customer. On top of this they are introducing smart sensors into the home which automates certain functions in the house to turn on when energy is the cheapest. Using electric heating as an example, Simon explained that these devices would account for when energy is cheapest, due to a surplus, and then turn on the heating during these times. aWATTar have a big mission, and are currently facing a few roadblocks. For example, only certain houses have the necessary smart sensors installed. However as the world is shifting towards electrical energy usage, aWATTar are well positioned to offer a great solution to the standard energy provider. aWATTar are not only providing answers that address climate change, but also helping their customers save money.

Lena Robinson – “Tech in service of financial literacy“ Lena is the Communications Astronaut at Three Coins, a company which researches and develops methods which foster financial literacy. Lena explained that with technology, we have a unique opportunity to help educate the younger generations concerning financial literacy. This is especially impactful, as many physiologists believe financial behaviour is learnt through our interactions with technology. Three Coins has developed a game to address financial literacy, as they wanted a scalable solution that tackled the problem before it started. This approach is in stark contrast to the current reality which mainly offers a one to one basis with a financial accountant after the issues already develop. She spoke about some of the issues Three Coins has faced as they developed a game for educational purposes.They found that although it reaches a lot of people, youths often need a follow up session or workshop, to ensure the learnings have successfully transferred. It helps the youths take in their game experience and apply it to everyday situations. This solution however routes back to one of the issues within the financial sector in the first place, that the solutions aren’t scalable. To address this issue, they have started their “Train the Trainer” program, so they can spread their knowledge to other people around the globe. Find out more about Three Coins. Anna Iarotska – “Teaching kids how to code using robots“ Anna, Co-Founder at Robo Wunderkind, began by emphasising the difference between the growth in the toy market verses the rest of the world. Lego started using their plastic bricks in 1960, and still uses the same design today. However, in comparison, we need only look at architecture in 1960 verses today: we see a big difference in growth and change. She explained that Robo Wunderkind are addressing this gap in development, while educating future generations in the process. Robo Wunderkind have designed a modular robot, which can be programmed using a smartphone/tablet app. This allows children learn coding by gamifying the experience. They believe this early interaction with coding will help future generations revolutionise technology in the future. The Robot they have designed can be built by combining different cubes. Each cube has a different function: infrared receivers, light receivers sound receivers, speakers and motors, just to name a few. Robo Wunderkind are not only aiming to change the face of toys, but also change the educational opportunities children have with toys, hoping to create a spark the minds that will change technology in the future.

Mit Toilettenblog.at hat er Österreichs ersten Issue Blog über den „am meisten unterschätzten Alltagsgegenstand unserer Zeit“ ins Leben gerufen. Warum Toiletten für Milliarden Menschen purer Luxus sind und er sich ehrenamtlich im Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise engagiert, erzählt er uns im Interview. Ein schräges Thema mit ernstem Hintergrund. Markus, welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich an? Es ist wohl die Leidenschaft am Außergewöhnlichen, die mich auszeichnet und zugleich auch antreibt. Anders sein, als alle anderen. Sonst würde ich wohl nicht über Toiletten bloggen und ein Thema in den Mittelpunkt rücken, über das man sonst nicht spricht – schon gar nicht in der Öffentlichkeit. Dabei sind Toiletten viel mehr als nur das, was wir auf den ersten Blick in ihnen sehen. Sie sind nicht nur der am meisten unterschätzte Alltagsgegenstand unserer Zeit, sondern in vielen Teilen der Welt auch echte Lebensretter. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Toiletten entdeckt? Die Leidenschaft hat sich aus einem Spaß heraus entwickelt. Ich habe 2010 begonnen, alle Toiletten zu fotografieren, die mich in meinem Leben begleiten. Sechs Jahre und über 600 Toilettenfotos später wurde daraus nicht nur ein eigener Issue Blog, sondern auch ein ehrenamtliches Engagement im Rahmen der World Toilet Organization (WTO, deren Mitglied ich bin), im Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Engagement gegeben? Ja. Denn während in unseren Breiten der Gang auf die Toilette nichts Außergewöhnliches darstellt, ist er in vielen Teilen der Welt alles andere als selbstverständlich. Mehr als 2,4 Milliarden Menschen auf diesem Planeten haben keinen Zugang zu einer ausreichenden Sanitärversorgung. Eine Milliarde ist gar gezwungen, ihre Notdurft im Freien zu verrichten. Auf diese Weise gelangen Krankheitserreger direkt in das Trinkwasser, in offene Trinkwasserstellen und letztlich auch in die Nahrungskette – ein Teufelskreis mit fatalen Folgen. Denn 80 Prozent aller Krankheiten in Entwicklungsländern stehen im Zusammenhang mit verunreinigtem Trinkwasser und knapp 600.000 Kinder unter fünf Jahren sterben jährlich an den Folgen von Durchfallerkrankungen; zurückzuführen auf katastrophale sanitäre Bedingungen und mangelnde Hygiene. Das ist der Auslöser und darauf mache ich aufmerksam. Mit dem Ziel, diesen Teufelskreis mit vereinten Kräften zu durchbrechen. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Weil das Thema Toiletten niemanden kalt lässt und längst auch die Vereinten Nationen auf den Plan gerufen hat. Internationale Zusammenarbeit und Aktionen rund um den jährlichen Welttoilettentag am 19. November sind Ausdruck dessen und enorm wichtig. Ich wünsche mir aber, dass die lebensrettende Rolle von Toiletten nicht nur an oder rund um diesen einen Tag im Jahr thematisiert wird, sondern das gesellschaftliche Engagement auch ganzjährig darüber hinausgeht. Mit meinem Toilettenblog will ich dazu beitragen, das Thema abseits eines bestimmten Kalenderdatums präsent zu halten. Dazu setze ich auf einen unkonventionellen und dennoch zeitgemäßen Kommunikationskanal, um genau das zu erreichen. Nämlich um aufzufallen und im Gespräch zu bleiben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es den Blog nicht gäbe? In Zeiten von gefühlten x-tausend beliebig austauschbaren Beauty-, Lifestyle-, Food- und Fashionblogs freut es mich, mit meinem Toilettenblog auch so etwas wie frischen Wind in die heimische Blogger-Szene zu bringen und neue Akzente zu setzen. Gäbe es den Toilettenblog nicht, wäre weiterhin alles more of the same. Und um das Thema wäre es bedeutend stiller. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In meiner Freizeit, abseits des Vollzeitjobs. Aber als Service Designer gehe ich ständig mit offenen Augen durch den Tag. Wenn Ideen oder Geistesblitze plötzlich da sind, dann muss man sie auch zulassen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zeitmanagement und Ehrenamtlichkeit sind meine größten Herausforderungen. Denn ich investiere einen Großteil meiner Freizeit abseits meines Vollzeitjobs als Unternehmensberater in den Blog, der für mich ein echtes Herzensanliegen ist. Weil das Thema wirklich wichtig ist. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Es ist immer wieder schön zu erleben, wie andere auf das Thema reagieren. Dass mein Blog auf den ersten Blick zu Verwunderung führt, nehme ich dabei gerne in Kauf. Ein bisschen Provokation hat noch nie geschadet um aufzufallen (lacht). Die Reaktionen sind eigentlich immer gleich. Werde ich anfangs noch belächelt, dass ich über Toiletten blogge, so folgt nach einem kurzen Hinweis auf den ernsten Hintergrund des Themas meist Staunen und Betroffenheit – häufig in Verbindung mit dem Austausch eigener, selbst er- oder durchlebter Toilettengeschichten. Wenn es soweit kommt, habe ich bereits gewonnen. Denn durch den gegenseitigen Austausch von Erfahrungen und Geschichten entsteht eine besonders intensive Form der Beschäftigung mit dem Thema. Und das ist für eine nachhaltige Bewusstseinsbildung unerlässlich. Wenn man so will, betreibe ich also Toiletten-Storytelling im Dienst der guten Sache. Ungewöhnlich, aber wirkungsvoll. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Allen voran meine Frau. Sie hat mein Engagement von Anbeginn unterstützt und bringt mich auch inhaltlich immer wieder auf neue Ideen. Aber auch Familie, Freunde, Bekannte und Kollegen gehören dazu, die mich immer wieder aufs Neue bestärken, dieses Herzensprojekt weiterzuführen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Nicht wer, sondern eher was. Nämlich die Gewissheit, dass ich über ein Thema blogge, das jeden gleichermaßen betrifft und das keinen Trends, Modeerscheinungen oder sonstigen Befindlichkeiten unterliegt. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Nachdem Toiletten ein Querschnittsthema mit Anknüpfungspunkten in alle Bereiche des täglichen Lebens sind, will ich meinen Blog künftig noch breiter aufstellen. Außerdem arbeite ich derzeit daran, bis zum kommenden Welttoilettentag am 19. November das umfangreichste deutschsprachige Informationsportal zum Thema aufzubauen. Dazu will ich auch weitere Partner aus dem Gesundheits-, Sanitär- und Technologiebereich mit ins Boot holen. Es bleibt also auf jeden Fall spannend. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Über den schrägen, unkonventionellen und natürlich auch humoristischen Einstieg in ein außergewöhnliches Thema, das in Wahrheit ein sehr ernstes ist. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Natürlich wurde ich anfangs belächelt. Das ist aber kein Thema mehr. Im Gegenteil. Mein Umfeld ist mittlerweile zu einem wichtigen Multiplikator-Netzwerk geworden, das mich immer wieder auf neue Aspekte, Ideen oder potenzielle Kooperationspartner aufmerksam macht. Dafür bin ich dankbar und weiß das sehr zu schätzen. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Natürlich. Statistisch gesehen geht jeder von uns sechs bis acht Mal täglich auf die Toilette und verbringt während seines Lebens bis zu zwei Jahre am Ort des Loslassens. Das ist unglaublich viel Lebenszeit, die man auch sinnvoll nutzen kann. Die Toilette ist heutzutage einer der wenigen Rückzugsorte im Alltag, an dem man noch ungestört ist und abschalten kann. Wenn man es also von diesem Gesichtspunkt betrachtet, ist die Toilette nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck, sondern auch eine mentale Kraftquelle. Und im Vergleich mit den 2,4 Milliarden Menschen, die keinen Zugang zu Toiletten haben, ist sie außerdem purer Luxus. Dessen sollte man sich immer bewusst sein. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Am meisten wünsche ich mir, dass der Kampf gegen die globale Sanitärkrise Wirkung zeigt und es mit vereinten internationalen Kräften gelingt, Leben zu retten. Bis es soweit ist, gibt es noch viel zu tun – aber die Richtung stimmt. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung? „Happy End – die stillen Örtchen dieser Welt“ von Nina Sedano. Sie hat jedes Land der Welt bereist und nimmt ihre LeserInnen mit auf eine spannende Reise durch die unterschiedlichsten Toilettenkulturen und Bräuche. Kurzweilig, informativ und für weltoffene Menschen unglaublich spannend. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Madeleine Sophie Daria. Besser bekannt als dariadaria. Weil sie ihre Reichweite und Relevanz als eine der erfolgreichsten österreichischen Bloggerinnen mittlerweile dafür nutzt, um neben dem üblichen „Blogger-Kommerz“ auch verstärkt auf gesellschaftskritische Themen aufmerksam zu machen. Dafür hat sie nicht nur meinen Respekt, sondern auch mich als Follower gewonnen. www.toilettenblog.at","April 12, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mashup-Banner-600x400.jpg"

They answered the call from Impact Hub Vienna and one weekend they all gathered together for a magical event called ‘The Storytelling Hackathon for Social Impact’. They came from many faraway lands – Spain, Turkey, Macedeonia, Bulgaria, England, The Czech Republic, Italy, Germany and The Netherlands – to attend this event held in the Kingdom of Vienna. In fact, more than 40 creative minds and social entrepreneurs gathered for 48 hours to collaborate and help some incredible Vienna based organisations share their stories with the world. The aim of the weekend was to create stories and raise awareness for 7 social impact ventures that are currently working to create change. On Friday evening at Impact Hub Vienna, a Town Crier from each of the 7 ventures spoke about their organisation and explained their challenges. Issues to be tackled over the weekend included: Showcasing the potential of a Robo Wunderkind robot to children Giving a personal and human face to the green energy company aWATTar Building a unique selling proposition for good food company Iss Mich! Finding how to better encourage entrepreneurs and ventures to apply for funding through the Investment Ready Program Creating an awareness campaign for computer recycling organization Compuritas Encouraging neighbours to register for the Frag Nebeban community program Finding the best way to remove labels and sterotypes for refugeeswork.at Participants listened in and were invited to chose their top 3 favourite challenges to work on. 7 groups were then created with a mix of professions, including bloggers, photographers, graphic designers, social entrepreneurs, illustrators, web designers, authors and directors. These groups were tasked with creating a ‘tale for the ages’ regarding their chosen venture. In addition to helping these organisations fill a gap in their marketing strategy, participants would walk away knowing that they were helping to make the world a better place. Fuelled by caffeine, sugar and enthusiasm they embarked on their quest. The groups worked furiously for 48 hours, bonding and networking, thinking outside the box and making magic. They drew, photographed, programmed, videoed and designed. In the lead up to the final showcase Ann Cathrin from Germany was glowing. “I am so happy to have had the opportunity to collaborate with so many creative minds. We had to learn to work as a team – everyone contributed hence everyone had ownership of the final product.” Sunday night everyone gathered in the town square, along with many of the other Vienna villagers, to hear each others stories. The results were simply incredible. In just 48 hours the groups had created new print, social media and advertising campaigns. They had designed logos, made websites and even designed stationery. The human side of some technical ventures were conveyed through videos and photography. Websites had been simplified and redesigned, and a new food packaging campaign was created. Ideas were fun, practical and beneficial to all the ventures. Participants left the event buzzing, motivated, and inspired. New friendships were created and partnerships formed. They travelled back to their faraway lands inspired and motivated……..","April 20, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bildschirmfoto_2016-03-10_um_10.07.01-600x400.png"

Nur wenige Monates später, im November 2015 folgte dann die Gründung von „Refugeeswork.at“, Österreichs erster Online Job-Plattform für geflüchtete Menschen. Refugeeswork.at bringt geflüchtete Menschen mit ArbeitgeberInnen zusammen. Den Flüchtlingen wird so der Zugang zu Arbeits- und Ausbildungsplätzen, die ihren Fähigkeiten entsprechen, erleichtert. ArbeitgeberInnen können versteckte Talente finden und von einer höheren Diversität ihrer MitarbeiterInnen zu profitieren. Was treibt Dich an? Die Arbeit mit großartigen Menschen und der Gedanke gemeinsam gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen, um nachhaltig etwas zu verändern – Stichwort: Impact! Hat es für dieses Projekt einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Mein erster Berührungspunkt mit dem Thema „Arbeitsmarktintegration von geflüchteten Menschen“ war, als ein Unternehmer mich um Hilfe bat, weil er einen Flüchtling beschäftigen wollte, aber die rechtliche Lage nicht kannte. Die endgültige Entscheidung Refugeeswork.at zu gründen, habe ich nach einer Begegnung mit einem Flüchtling getroffen. Ich habe mich ca. 1 Stunde mit ihm unterhalten und mit ihm über seine Vergangenheit und seine Pläne für die Zukunft gesprochen. Ich war beeindruckt von seiner starken Persönlichkeit und seinen Ambitionen, und konnte nicht verstehen, warum wir das Potential solcher Menschen in Österreich nicht nützen. Also habe ich es mir zur Aufgabe gemacht, daran etwas zu ändern. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt Integrationsarbeit bei Dir ein? Einen sehr hohen! Sie ist der einzige Weg, um geflüchtete Menschen in unsere Gesellschaft integrieren und ihnen so eine Perspektive zu schenken. Abgesehen davon, sehe ich die „Flüchtlingskrise“ – trotz aller Schwierigkeiten – als große Chance, da wir ein demographisches Problem haben, dass wir ohne Zuwanderung nicht lösen werden können. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Sehr neugierig. Ich lese sehr viel und interessiere mich für viele Dinge. Welche Rolle spielt Freiwilligenarbeit bei dir ganz persönlich? Ich denke, dass Freiwilligenarbeit das Potential hat viel zu verändern, vor allem, wenn Freiwillige NGOs mit ihren Kernfähigkeiten unterstützen. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Um ehrlich zu sein, haben sich beide Projekte relativ zufällig ergeben. Wirklich angefangen an diesen Projekten zu arbeiten haben wir, weil wir in beiden Fällen davon überzeugt waren, dass sie unheimlich großes Impact-Potential haben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Wenn es uns nicht geben würde, würde hoffentlich jemand anderes genau das tun, was wir gerade tun. Zumindest glaube ich daran, dass es – vor allem in unserem Alter – unheimlich viele Menschen gibt, die wahnsinnig motiviert sind gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen und etwas zu verändern. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Bei meiner Arbeit, mit dem besten Team überhaupt. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Ich arbeite unheimlich gerne und es gibt Vieles was ich dabei „schön“ finde. Zum einen, zu wissen, dass ich nicht nur arbeite, um Geld zu verdienen. Zum anderen, zu sehen auf wieviel die Menschen in meinem Team verzichten und wie sehr sie sich dafür einsetzen unsere Ideen und Überzeugungen zu verwirklichen. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Team meine Freundin, meine Freunde und meine Familie. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Vor allem meine Freundin und mein Team. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Ja, ich gründe gerade mit 2 Freunden ein neues Unternehmen, bei dem ich allerdings im Tagesgeschäft bzw. operativ nicht stark involviert sein werde. Die Idee ist Unternehmen dabei zu helfen Personalmanagement und Recruiting so zu gestalten, dass gleichzeitig sozialer Mehrwert geschaffen wird – sozusagen Personalmanagement & Recruiting mit Impact! Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Ich denke, dass liegt eher an den Projekten, die sich ergeben und den Menschen, die ich zufällig treffe. Bis jetzt hatte ich das großes Glück, immer die richtigen Leute zur richtigen Zeit getroffen zu haben! Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden gut was ich tue, aber es ist manchmal ein bisschen schwer, weil ich relativ wenig Freizeit habe. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Einfach anfangen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Für mich selbst nicht, ich bin glücklich so wie alles ist. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung? Es gibt unheimlich viele gute Bücher… … aber da sind zwei Bücher, die ich zwar selbst noch nicht gelesen haben, aber auf jeden Fall bald lesen werde: Holacracy von Brian J. Robertson und Reinventing Organisations von Frederic Laloux’s. ","April 21, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Refugee-works-image-600x400.jpg"

In den vergangenen 12 Jahren war Christoph im Kulturmanagement, Banking, Online Marketing und im Startup-Bereich tätig. Neben seinem BWL-Studium an der WU Wien machte er erste Erfahrungen im Consulting und arbeitete für Vermögensverwaltungen in Wien und Liechtenstein. Zeitgleich baute Christoph ein Auktionshaus für österreichische Kunst aus dem 20. und 21. Jahrhundert auf. Nach 6 Jahren im Banking und Kulturmanagement spezialisierte er sich auf Online Marketing mit Fokus auf Social Media. 2013 gründete Christoph mit 5 jungen Unternehmern den gemeinnützigen Verein AustrianStartups zur Förderung und Unterstützung von Startups. AustrianStartups ist erste Anlaufstelle für jeden Startup-Interessierten und der neutrale Startup Community-Entwickler in Österreich. Gegründet von einer Unternehmerin und 5 Unternehmern 2013, ist AustrianStartups ein gemeinnütziger Verein, in dem rund 50 ehrenamtliche Mitarbeiter täglich damit beschäftigt sind, Startups das Leben in Österreich einfacher zu machen. Christoph, was treibt Dich an? Das Unmögliche, das Unbekannte, Synergien zwischen Menschen herstellen, unlösbare Probleme, Ehrlichkeit & Offenheit und spannende Projekte. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Entrepreneurship entdeckt? Wahrscheinlich war es in meiner Jugend, als ich als ehrenamtlicher Betreuer & Coach für Kinder und Jugendliche tätig war. Was fasziniert dich am Unternehmertum so? Es sind einerseits die Menschen dahinter und ihre Geschäftsidee, die große Probleme lösen, ganze Industrien auf den Kopf stellen und mitunter bahnbrechende Innovationen hervorbringen. Andererseits liebe ich die Lösungsorientierung von Startup-UnternehmerInnen: don’t bullshit, just do it. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Engagement bei und für AustrianStartups gegeben? Als mich ein Freund fragte, ob ich AustrianStartups mit ihm und 4 anderen GründerInnen aufbauen möchte, war das Startup Thema noch vollkommen neu für mich. Nationale wie internationale Beispiele haben mich einfach fasziniert: dafür eine off- und online Community Plattform zu bauen, hat mich dann gefesselt. Was sind Deine Ziele mit AustrianStartups? Jeder Mensch, der ein Startup in Österreich gründen möchte, soll durch unsere Arbeit 2-3 Schritte weiterkommen. Zusätzlich möchte ich gemeinsam mit Startuppern an besseren Bedingungen für Gründerinnen und Gründer arbeiten. Wieviel Leidenschaft braucht Entrepreneurship? Wieviel Leidenschaft brauchen GründerInnen von Startups? Leidenschaft ist für mich der Dreh- und Angelpunkt von Entrepreneurship. Sie ist die treibende Kraft, die GründerInnen dazu bringt, mehr ins Risiko zu gehen und Zeit & Energie einzusetzen als andere. Vielleicht haben Startup-Gründer etwas mehr Leidenschaft als ein klassischer Gründer, weil es schwieriger, riskanter und aufwändiger ist. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Aktuell bestimmt es mein gesamtes Leben, weil ich neben AustrianStartups auch mein Studium mit dem Schwerpunkt Entrepreneurship & Innovation abschließe. Aber für mich ist Entrepreneurship mehr eine Geisteshaltung oder eine Gewohnheit, die man nicht abstellen kann. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? O ja. Wenn mich etwas interessiert, dann kann die Zeit schon einmal verfliegen und Stunden gelesen, gefilmt, geschaut oder recherchiert werden. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Euch nicht geben würde? Zeit. Mit all dem, was AustrianStartups tut, versuchen wir einerseits Startup-Interessierten den Einstieg bzw. das Gründen und Startup Betreiben zu erleichtern. So findet die Gründerin ihren neuen Mitarbeiter auf einem Stammtisch, oder ein Startup eine Investitionsmöglichkeit. Andererseits arbeiten wir eng mit allen Stakeholdern zusammen, um als neutraler Knotenpunkt gemeinsam die Community voranzubringen. Was treibt Dich an immer wieder neue Projekt zu starten? Irgendwie bin ich da rastlos und muss mir nach einer gewissen Zeit ein weiteres oder neues Projekt suchen. Dabei sind es einfach neue Ideen und spannende Problemlösungen. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich nehme ihn mir einfach. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Wahrscheinlich genügend Schlaf, aber das ist es mir wert. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Mich beeindruckt am meisten die Bereitschaft so vieler faszinierende Menschen in Österreich, sich für andere GründerInnen einzusetzen, damit sie aus ihren Fehlern lernen können. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Sehr oft hilft mir da ein offenes und „non judgmental“ Ohr, das ich bei meiner Freundin und Freunden finde. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Da lasse ich mich überraschen. Für mich ist immer entscheidend, was ist die Idee und welches Team steht dahinter. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Weil ich selber dafür glühe und keine Scheu habe, dass auch zu zeigen. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Manchmal kommen sie mir wie ein Fan Club vor <U+0001F609> Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Nicht zu viel planen, sondern einfach machen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Zu viele <U+0001F609> Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? In den vergangenen Jahren gab es 4 Dinge, die mich inspiriert und zum Nachdenken gebracht haben: die täglichen Vlogs von Startupgründer & Youtuber Casey Neistat; TEDxVienna Konferenzen; die Berge & Seen im Salzkammergut und Reisen.

Spring has arrived once again. Spring is not just blossoms bursting forth; it is also a time when we celebrate our planet. So in honor of all the Earth Day celebrations, we wanted to feature some of our Impact Hub members that are creating some pretty powerful green impact. Meet Impact Hub member Angie Rattay: Angie is the founder of NEONGREEN Network, an online platform changing the world through connecting people, networks and information. Angie also founded EARTHtalks an annual conference focused on addressing environmental issues. So Angie, what are you working on? At the moment we are in the finishing stretch of organising one of the biggest eco-social bottom-up events in Europe! The EARTHtalks are almost fully booked with only a few seats remaining for both the interactive morning program – the Neongreen HubClub – as well as the main event. Tickets are still available at www.erdgespraeche.net, but not for long! What needs to go in your green smoothie? The NEONGREEN Smoothie needs a pinch of motivation, a spoon full of activism, a big portion of voluntary work and good vibes on top. Up next is Theresa Steininger: Theresa is the chief director at Wohnwagon, a company producing ecologically and sustainably tiny houses, as well an incredible resource for those wanting to live a more self-sufficient lifestyle. So Theresa, what is Wohnwagon currently working on? We want to inspire more people to rethink the way we live – that is why we developed our latest “baby” – the magazine “OSKAR” for independent and sustainable living. It is112 pages of inspiration, tips and interesting projects that show how it can be done. We are also working on building our production for the Wohnwagon to better serve our customers. And what would be in your ideal green smoothie? Passion, a great network and an awesome team! Finally we checked in with Bettina Steinbrugger: Bettina is a co-founder of erdbeerwoche, a company tackling the issue of sustainability within feminine hygiene products and taking this issue mainstream. Bettina what are you and erdbeerwoche currently working on? Many things in parallel! erdbeerwoche is currently expanding to the DACH region, that is why we just finished a film project with WDR. We currently participate at several trade shows in Germany and will enter the Swiss market with our onlineshop soon! What needs to be in a your ideal green smoothie? I actually prefer red smoothies, as in bloody red, but if it needs to be a green one: Kiwi, banana, some herbs and a lot of passion. I am certainly inspired by all the green smoothie ideas as well as the incredible impact created by our Hub members! What do you put in your green smoothie? How are you celebrating Spring and creating green impact? Let us know on Facebook and Instagram! ","April 29, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-600x400.jpg"

These and many other questions were tackled at the recent workshop put on by the Fear and Fail movement at Impact Hub Vienna, supported by Christine Spernbauer and Impact Hub Scaling. The format of the event was designed to be interactive instead of just a talkfest. The night started when we were all tasked with meeting people around us without giving our name and without talking about what we do. A little tougher than it sounds! After we mingled, we broke into 3 groups. The aim of these groups was to come up with 2 questions for each of our guest speakers. Not only did we get to interact with the speakers themselves, but we also got to enjoy interesting conversation and listen to differing opinions from participants in the room. Our first speaker was Eugene Quinn, an expat from London who didn’t move to Vienna by choice. Eugene spoke about what it was like to move to Austria and leave your home country. Coming to a city that was more conservative and clinging to tradition could have been considered a challenge destined to fail. Instead, Eugene faced it head on and deliberately took on tasks that took him (and others) out of their comfort zones. Learning German, for example, is something that Eugene is proud of. Make no mistake, his German isn’t perfect – he likes to refer to it as ‘Freestyle Deutsch’ – but he doesn’t see this as a failure. Instead, he celebrates his mistakes because he believes it is about the message he is communicating, rather than the grammar. Eugene also talked about turning ‘failures’ into opportunities. His company spaceandplace.at runs ‘Vienna Ugly’ a walking tour showcasing some of the worst of Vienna’s buildings. The city of Vienna fined him for this, believing it was against what Vienna stood for. Then Eugene took a risk and spoke publicy about his fine, explaining how Vienna wasn’t ready to move forward with innovative new ideas. The media grabbed the story and his tours became even more popular. He also didn’t receive any more fines. Our second speaker was Neha Chatwani from The Workplace Atelier. An organizational psychologist Neha used examples from her career to demonstrate how she dealt with fear. It started when she was rejected from her first job interview because they believed she didn’t ‘look’ like she could do it. Rather than letting this fear of rejection shape her life, she approached it head-on and used it to help her keep focus. When Neha was 10 years old, she began observing adults and watching how they navigated the world. They woke up in the morning, went to work, earned money, went grocery shopping and generally took good care of themselves. The problem was that 10 year old Neha could not imagine how she would become this ‘responsible adult’ she was observing. It seemed impossible. Luckily her mother gave her some valuable advice that she has come back to many times throughout her life: wait and see. Over time, Neha has learnt to trust herself and her judgements. Neha has developed her own unique way of addressing challenges and will regularly sit down on the couch to have conversations with herself – out loud. For her, this puts things into perspective and she is able to gain focus. She has no problem laughing at her mistakes, and when something doesn’t turn out exactly as planned, she simply adjusts her expectations. The takeaway of the workshop for this blogger was when Neha said, “Define your own definition of success. Don’t let anyone else determine it for you. They have no idea what makes you tick or makes you happy. Why should they get a say in your happiness?” ","May 3, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fear-and-Fail-Blog-600x400.jpg"

Thiemo ist seit jeher unternehmerisch denkend und aktiv, medienaffin, technologieversiert, gerne unterwegs auf Reisen, und er liebt gutes Essen. Mit dem Fifteen Seconds Festival machen wir am 16. und 17. Juni 2016 in Graz eine Konferenz, die einfach anders ist. Keine Egos, keine Titel, kein Bullshit. Dafür ein intensives zweitägiges Erlebnis, das einen klaren Auftrag hat: challenging the commercial future. Mit dabei sind Vordenker von The New York Times, Shazam, Buzzfeed, Red Bull, GQ, Oracle, Allianz und vielen weiteren globalen Marken. Was treibt Dich an? Etwas Neues zu erschaffen, jeden Tag mit motivierten Leuten an einer Vision zu arbeiten, viel unterwegs zu sein und beeindruckende Menschen, Unternehmen und Orte kennenzulernen. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für genau dieses Projekt entdeckt? Ich war gemeinsam mit meinem Mitgründer auf zahlreichen internationalen Konferenzen unterwegs und wir haben jedes Mal, wenn wir nach Österreich zurückgekommen sind, festgestellt, dass es hierzulande — mit wenigen Ausnahmen [Pioneers Festival] — an innovativen Konferenzformaten mangelt. Gepaart mit unserer brennenden Leidenschaft für Marketing war das die Geburtsstunde unseres Unternehmens. Was ist das Reizvolle dabei? Wenn tausende Leute vor der Tür warten und dann begeistert sind von dem, woran man ein Jahr lang hart mit einem eingeschworenen Team gearbeitet hat. Internationale Größen kennenzulernen, Lernerlebnisse zu gestalten, die etwas auslösen in den Menschen und nachhaltige Netzwerke zwischen Teilnehmern, Speakern und Partnern zu spinnen. Was war alles vor „Fifteen Seconds“? Ich habe früh begonnen, mich selbstständig zu machen und freiberuflich als Designer für Kunden und Agenturen zu arbeiten. Meine nächste Station hat mich zu einem Softwareunternehmen gebracht, wo ich ein Jahr lang das Unternehmen auch Marketing- und Vertriebsseitig mit aufbauen durfte und neben der Mitarbeit an spannenden Projekten auch viel unternehmerische Erfahrung gesammelt habe. Was sind Eure längerfristigen Ziele mit „Fifteen Seconds“? Wir leben modernen praxisorientierten Wissenstransfer in einer globalen Community. Diese Position wollen wir mit dem Festival als die Konferenzveranstaltung im deutschsprachigen Raum weiter ausbauen und dabei weiters auch ganzjährig unserem Ziel nachkommen, Netzwerkmöglichkeiten zu schaffen und spannenden Persönlichkeiten internationaler Marken eine Bühne und Plattform zu bieten. Internationale Formate stehen dabei jedenfalls auf unserer Liste, genauso wie ein gesundes Wachstum zuhause. Wie gelingt es Dir, so außergewöhnliche Speaker nach Graz zu bekommen? Wir sind das ganze Jahr über an Persönlichkeiten dran, die uns inhaltlich begeistern. Diese Recherchearbeit endet in vielen hunderten Vorschlägen, die wir in regelmäßigen Abständen gemeinsam besprechen und dann sehr hartnäckig anschreiben. Vielen schreiben sofort zurück, mit einigen führen wir lange Gespräche und an manchen sind wir mehrere Monate lang dran. Der Prozess unterliegt zwei goldenen Wörtern mit Bindestrich: Follow-up. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Der internationale Titel unseres Festivals lautet ja Europe’s Festival for Curious Minds. Der beschreibt genau das, was mich auch als Mensch antreibt: die Bereit- und Leidenschaft für lebenslanges Lernen und der stete Blick über den Tellerrand hinaus. Das ist für mich Neugier, also ja. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Euch nicht geben würde? Jede Menge internationaler Spirit, ein motiviertes Team, das aus Graz heraus einmal im Jahr ein starkes Line-up internationaler Entscheidungsträger von globalen Marken vereint, viele spannende Geschichten auf der Bühne und online und eine Plattform, die zum Netzwerken und Lernen einlädt. Allem voran: Eine stetig wachsende Community, die etwas bewegen will, Bock auf die Zukunft hat und Mut dafür macht. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Tagtäglich entweder in unserem Büro mit unserem Team oder unterwegs auf Reisen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zeitweise auf Freizeit, aber da Arbeit für mich nie negativ konnotiert war, erlebe ich das nicht als Verzicht. Natürlich ist speziell die Zeit vor dem Festival sehr vereinnahmend, wenn man dafür aber jeden Morgen weiß, wofür man aufsteht, ist es das ohne jeden Zweifel wert. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Abwechslung, die die Arbeit rund um das Festival mit sich bringt. Das Team, mit dem man Jahr für Jahr Großartiges auf die Beine stellen kann. Die Kontakte, die sich dabei ergeben. Hautnah mitzuerleben, wie etwas Großes entsteht. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Danke Mama für das gute Mittagessen jeden Sonntag. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Freunde, Familie und ein Team, das immer an unseren Erfolg glaubt. Auch oder vor allem in Zeiten, wo wir noch keinen Namen hatten und uns in Österreich viel Gegenwind entgegenkam. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Aktuell konzentrieren wir unsere Arbeit auf den 16. und 17. Juni und werden im Sommer in einen ausgiebigen Urlaub starten, danach gehen wir neue Projekte und Ziele an. Wie gelingt es Dir, Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Was wir seitdem wir gestartet sind nie geändert haben, ist unsere Liebe zum Detail in allem, was wir machen. Ich denke, dass eben das, gemeinsam mit der Leidenschaft, die wir an den Tag legen, andere Menschen begeistert und automatisch mitreißt. Es ist doch immer so: Nur wenn du selbst von etwas zu 100% überzeugt bist und dafür in deinem Herzen brennst, erzeugst du eine Energie, die andere ansteckt und mitnimmt. Das ist der erste Punkt, an dem etwas Großes in Bewegung kommen kann und man Momentum gewinnt. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Anfangs war es für viele nicht greifbar und verständlich, wohin die Reise gehen könnte. Trotzdem habe ich immer viel Unterstützung aus dem Umfeld von Freunden und Familie erfahren, mittlerweile fiebern sie genauso wie das Team jedem Festival entgegen. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Sich nicht von Nein-Sagern entmutigen zu lassen, davon gibt es ja hierzulande leider zu viele. An seine Vision zu glauben und weiterzumachen, egal wie hart es zwischendurch sein mag. Nicht zuletzt: Den 16. und 17. Juni in Graz zu verbringen und gerne auch unser Magazin fifteenseconds.co zu lesen, da bauen wir gerade was auf. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Alles was in meiner Hand liegt, woran ich selbst arbeiten kann, sind für mich keine Wünsche, sondern Ziele. Wünsche sind für mich Dinge, die ich nicht beeinflussen kann und das ist die Gesundheit von allen Leuten, die mir wichtig sind. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Das wäre ein Buch MANAGE YOUR DAY TO DAY, ein Magazin THE VERGE und ein YouTube-Channel VOX . Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Unbedingt Martin Auer. Er vereint die Meisterprüfung zum Bäcker und einen Executive MBA der WU Wien in seiner Person und hat es in den letzten Jahren nach der Übernahme des Familienbetriebs geschafft, aus dem traditionsreichen Grazer Bäckereiunternehmen eine Marke zu machen, die für Leidenschaft steht.","May 5, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/theimo2-600x400.png"
"40","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/11/storytelling-language-can-build/","ImpactHub","Storytelling: The Language We Can Build On","When I applied for the Storytelling Hackathon hosted at Impact Hub Vienna a few weekends ago, I didn’t know I would meet a community that speaks the same language. A few weeks ago, my magazine, DoR, celebrated seven years. Starting in 2009 as an experiment, we wanted to show people how we thought a good magazine should look like and read. Since then, it has become a leading name in Romanian journalism and synonymous with the idea of powerful storytelling. From the beginning, DoR strove to advocate for the virtues of the story, as a tool to explain how the world changes. From writing on the importance of diacritical letters which make the Romanian language special, to how a city tries to hide its Roma residents behind a wall, to what happened to Bucharest firefighters when they lost a colleague in a fire for the first time in 45 years, we documented personal stories and told them in a way which allowed the readers to connect, to empathize, and to understand. We built and continue to build bridges through the stories we tell. In 2011 we took it further and began organizing an annual storytelling conference called The Power of Storytelling. Here we bring Pulitzer Prize and National Magazine Awards winners, writers, illustrators, photographers, documentary film makers, musicians, journalism entrepreneurs, and all sorts of storytellers who can share their craft with an audience. Slowly, we built more than bridges: we built a community of storytellers, people who strive to show, not tell. While this community of storytellers was an important step, we still have a long way to go before we can definitively say storytelling is a common tool in Romania. When I think on my experience in training NGO professionals, it seems that numbers continue to have more weight in their eyes than personal stories. And as I continued to lead more trainings, the past five years account to very little change in the way organizations explain what they do. Which is precisely why I was excited about the Storytelling Hackathon led by Impact Hub Vienna a few weekends ago. However, as my previous experience showed me, I was also weary about what we would be able to accomplish in such a short time. I couldn’t imagine how we could bring all our expertise to a common ground in just 48 hours. Well, little did I know what a magical a weekend it would turn out to be. I should’ve seen it coming when we spent about two hours on Saturday creating adventure stories for Robo Wunderkind, our assigned project, and discarding most of them for being not exciting enough. “But this is so predictable”, would say Clemens. “But this does not show us how it works”, would say Inbar. “But this doesn’t allow us to connect with the character”, would say Hailey. No one fought for their egos, no one thought they had the best idea. But they all fought for the story. A story that would make sense, that would be exciting, that would give us a character to cheer for. Also, a story that would be true in all aspects: that would show truthfully what Robo Wunderkind can do, (in case you haven’t checked it out, it’s a modular programmable robot for children that can do tons of functions) and that would ring true to the audience, meaning that the storyline, the logic, and the drive would be believable. After we decided what to do (stop motion video, online sharing platform, and story instrucitonal booklets), I got caught up in the production process. I didn’t think about how easily we reached a consensus, until the debriefing at the end of the Hackathon, on Sunday night. I looked around me and there were about 50 people in the room. In 48 hours, we had produced campaigns, videos, platforms, posters, messages and packaging for seven local initiatives. I had just watched three videos for a service that brings together skilled refugees and Austrian employers and I had been in awe at how nuanced, profound and truly prejudice-challenging they were. I had seen a campaign that showed us that all vegetables are the same on the inside, no matter how ugly or beautiful they are on the outside. I had been floored by a campaign that turned something as dry as saving energy into an idea easy to understand and get behind. And all that through stories. Stories that were true, specific, and relatable. And that is when I realized what a wonderful experience the Hackathon was for us. Everyone involved understood the importance of the storytelling. This inherent basis allowed us to create complex, real and useful content that can bring people closer to the projects and closer to each other. Although we came from different countries, although we had such diverse professional backgrounds, we all spoke the same language in terms of storytelling. To me, that is proof that even in the absence of common words or cultural references, we can build bridges (and campaigns, for that matter) based only on our understanding of what makes a good story. Because as I learned a long time ago, a good story is always the answer to the question “How should I live my life?” And no matter where we come from, we all need to find that answer.","May 11, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hackathonheader-600x400.jpg"
"41","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/13/writing-those-first-words-skill-share-breakfast-with-salwa-youssef/","ImpactHub","Where to Begin: Skill Share Breakfast with Writer Salwa Youssef","One Wednesday morning 15 writers (published and aspiring) met at Impact Hub Vienna for a Skill Share Breakfast. Led by Salwa Yossef, a published writer with experience across many topics, they all learned the important steps one should take before beginning to write a piece. Salwa talked us through a tried and true method to writing a great novel, article, poem or even love letter. Planning, she explained, is key to success and should never be underestimated. To plan well you need to cover the following stages: The ‘When’ part: Deadlines are critical in writing. If you aren’t given one, make one for yourself! Contact people, make appointments and collect information. You undertake passive thinking (where you think about the assignment during normal activities and let it percolate) and active thinking (when you link the story through research, interviews etc). The ‘Who’ part: Here it is important to identify to two key players. Firstly, who are we writing for and what do they want addressed through the piece you are writing? It is important to fully understand the outputs or key points this person would like to see in our piece, before we begin. Secondly, we need to identify the audience we are writing for. What are the key points they need to know? The ‘What’ part: What are we going to write about? Along with this question comes another – ‘What is my style?’ This is the time to think about how the piece will be written. Is it promotional? Academic? Informative? Entertaining? The ‘Where’ part: Every writer is different and though it may sound silly, everyone has a place where they prefer to write. This is the place where they feel comfortable and the writing flows. Whenever you need to write, go to that place! The ‘Why’ part: Write like it’s your job. It was here that Salwa explained that she didn’t think of writing as art, because there is always a right and a wrong. Spelling, grammar and punctuation must all be correct – and this is SO important! After you have gone through these stages, then you begin to write. Pieces of the Pie: The first 2/3 of your piece comes together by connecting all the dots. You put all different pieces of the story together and juggle them around till you create something. The next 1/3 comes when you rewrite. Sleep on it and then rewrite again. And repeat. Final Touches: Then comes editing and proofreading. Salwa stressed that editing is a skill and it is important to use a professional editor, and not just another writer friend, when editing your work. It is here that your words are refined and finessed and fit for publishing. Once your piece has been edited, you then need to proofread. This can be done by a friend or a professional. It is at this point we ensure the story has consistency and no mistakes. Take-aways: Great advice from someone who has been there and done that. We were left with a lot of other juicy advice, but the final (and for me the most important) word of wisdom we were told was to have FUN; remember to experiment, try new things, and enjoy the process.

"42","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/05/17/creative-process-48-hours/","ImpactHub","The Creative Process in 48 Hours","The first time I heard about the 1001Vienna – a Storytelling Hackathon for Social Impact was early one Friday morning in February. It was for a Creative Mornings lectures and it was the first time I set foot in the Impact Hub Vienna. Despite being only half awake, I immediately felt the energy of the place and was intrigued by the people there. When I heard that the Hackathon would accept 40 creatives from across Europe for a weekend workshop, I was eager to apply even though I wasn’t quite sure what a ‘Storytelling Hackathon’ actually was. I guess eagerness doesn’t always lead to action, because the next thing I knew, the day of the deadline had arrived and I hadn’t sent anything in yet. Quickly, I filled out the online form, hoping for the best and wishing I wasn’t such a procrastinator. I was excited to find out a week later that I had been accepted, and when I arrived at the Hub, I found that everyone I spoke to had applied the day of the deadline. Are all creatives prone to procrastination? This weekend there would be no time to waste. With only 48 hours to complete our task of helping seven impact ventures communicate their stories, we would need to brainstorm and execute our ideas quickly and efficiently. It all started on Friday night, when we were assigned to our groups and Saturday morning the real work would begin. I was assigned to work with Investment Ready, a program that helps entrepreneurs from central and eastern Europe create scalable solutions for global programs. I was inspired by the work they were doing. However with such a broad target group, it was challenging to convey the work Investment Ready was doing in a succinct and personable way. It was up to me and the others in my group to find a solution. We all know that group projects are not always easy… Recently a friend of mine sent me a cartoon that read, “When I die, I want my group project members to lower me into the grave… so they can let me down, one last time.” Slightly morbid, I know, but I couldn’t help but laugh as I recalled the many group project experiences of my academic and professional career. I’m happy to say that my Hackathon team took group project work to a new level. The Investment Ready Program group was an international dream team coming from Russia, Czech Republic, Germany, the US and Austria. We had a film maker, a creative director, a web designer, a graphic designer, and a journalist. Everyone was totally engaged and ready to do their best work. Countless brainstorming sessions, discussions, and cups of coffee later, the first day was over. And we still had nothing! Ok, not ‘nothing.’ We had plenty of ideas, but had yet to create any concrete outputs. The pressure was on and day two was going to be hard. Fast forward to Sunday afternoon and we were wrapping up our video shoot. Who knew we were all such great actors? Well, maybe we won’t be winning any Oscars soon, but we certainly enjoyed ourselves. In the end we managed to create and finish all of our deliverables in the final three hours leading up to the deadline. When time was up, we went straight into the showcase. Positive energy seemed to surge throughout the building as each group presented the amazingly creative, funny, beautiful and clever solutions they had created to solve their start-up’s communication problem. As I watched the presentations from the other groups, I realized that all of the teams were international dream teams! Creating websites, videos, print and photography campaigns, each group had produced an incredible amount of outputs given the intensive 48 hour deadline. Overall, the weekend was an amazing experience for me. I have never met so many engaged, passionate, creative and hardworking people in one place.

We are already giving away an MBA scholarship, so we thought why not give you some tips from an expert on how to help you make the perfect application video. So get ready to take some notes. But first let’s start from the beginning. Impact Hub Vienna is giving members the chance to win a fully-funded scholarship worth 25,000 Euros for an MBA (Master of Business Administration) at MODUL University Vienna. You can find all the details on our website, but one thing you need to know is that you need to make an application video. Say what?! Take a deep breath and relax, because we are going to coach you through it with the help of our in house filmmaker extraordinaire – Filippo Rezzadore. With more than 8 years in the industry, Filippo was full of tips and tricks for those newbie filmmakers. Planning is key Write down what you want to communicate. Who you are making the video for and what the main points you want to get across? Structuring and planning the video around these points is key for a successful end result. Think about sound There is nothing worse than a great video with terrible sound quality. Filippo suggests choosing a quiet place without an echo. Try to use a room with furniture, and a carpet if possible, to absorb the sound. Shoot in a clear and simple frame And what does that mean exactly? Keep what the viewer sees (the frame) as simple and clean as possible. Keep the subject (you) in focus and move everything else to the background, so that it doesn’t distract the viewer. Avoid projecting shadows on the background by using natural or side lighting and never use front lighting. You don’t need the latest equipment Don’t worry about running out to buy the latest camera – your smartphone will be fine. Stabilise it by propping your smartphone up against a book, shelf or lamp. Or simply ask if someone can help you keep it in place. Remember to avoid the selfie video. That format is not suitable for your application video. Short and simple statements. Don’t use long sentences and complex vocabulary to impress the judges. Keep you sentences simple to ensure that you speak clearly and concisely. And with those tips fresh in our mind, we are ready to start filming. Thanks for your words of wisdom Filippo! And to those applicants out there: the deadline is June 30th, 2016, so get filming!

We’ve been following Billie, one of the newest members of Impact Hub Vienna, as she explores how to get the most out of her Impact Hub membership. Billie is a social entrepreneur based out of Vienna, passionate about creating positive change and inspired by other like minded people. You can check out her first blog post to get better acquainted. Billie was getting a little tired of the falafel and schnitzel she had been eating for lunch and was searching for some brain food to keep her fingers typing and her mind sharp. Craving something healthy for lunch, she jumped at the chance to join the Sexy Salad on Tuesday. Eating a sexy salad while meeting fellow Hubbers? She was totally in. Fast Recap: What is Sexy Salad? A weekly gathering where Hub-Members and guests prepare salad together and share a meal, while getting to know one another better. Where does it take place? At the kitchen of Impact Hub Vienna on the 1st floor. When is this sexiness happening? Every Tuesday. We start preparing at 12:00pm and the real (m)eating starts at 12:30pm. Around 1:30pm the washing machine will be turned on and the and work keeps going on and on. Why should you attend? To have a healthy lunch. To meet and connect with like minded individuals. To introduce yourself and share your impact story that brought you to the table. To feel creative by making your own sexy salad. Billie’s personal Sexy Salad adventure: Tuesday morning, fingers typing, the host approached me. I was listening to music and couldn’t hear what he said. But thanks to my expert lip reading skills, I interpreted, ‘’Will you join me sexy madam?’’ Huh? Me…? Sexy…? With this bad hair day…? Taking off my headphones, he repeated, “Will you join the sexy salad?” Ha! Of course. A sexy salad. “So, are you joining?” he asked again. I’m new here and had no idea about Sexy Salad. He explained that Sexy Salad is one of the Weeklies, also known as the community co-created lunch. People bring their veggies/salad ingredients and prepare them together with other members or visitors. I quickly weighed my options: sandwich over my laptop or delicious community inspired salad. The decision was not challenging and I immediately wanted to join in. One tiny problem though: I didn’t have any veggies to contribute! No worries there, reassured the host. He was going to the market to buy some ingredients and I only needed to contribute a few Euros! So I chopped, washed, cooked, laughed, set the table, ate, and made some new friends. Wait a minute, it’s Tuesday again! Maybe I’ll see you there! Billie is on her way to Sexy Salad! You coming with? Tips: Be proactive about meeting new people! If you are interested in Sexy Salad you don’t have to sign up, just come to the host with your veggies and say Hi! If you are a newcomer, like Billie, let the host know, so we can have a short round of introductions. If you have no cooking skills don’t worry…the only recipe you need is your imagination! Bon Appetit! Or since we are in Vienna – Mahlzeit!","May 31, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sexysaladheader-600x400.jpg"
"45","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/06/02/money-money-money/","ImpactHub","Money, Money, Money","Money. While the topic might make some of us squirm in our seats, it is an important topic to address when starting a business. Here at Impact Hub Vienna we dont shy away from this sensitive topic. Whether developing sustainable business models with the help of our Accelerate Program or finding and preparing for investment with the Investment Ready Program, we guide our ventures through the whole process. At the core of all of this is Impact Investment. But what is Impact Investing? Impact Investing is… an investment approach that intentionally seeks to create both financial return and positive social and/or environmental impact that is actively measured. (Taken from a Charly Kleissner slide showed at last years CEE Impact Day) Social businesses are not the only ones with money concerns. Over 40% of households in the Eurozone are in debt and we have some dedicated Hub members addressing this issue. Working in different regions of the financial sector, Three Coins, Franz Karl Prüller, Charly Kleissner, and Erste Bank pack a pretty powerful punch when it comes to addressing financial issues. Three Coins Three Coins is developing educational tools and formats to promote responsible personal finance. The team comprises of experts in education, social sciences, economics and entrepreneurship. Three Coins aims its efforts at people with so-called “open learning windows”, who welcome personal finance tips and are open to new input. This includes, youth in professional training or transitioning into adulthood, newly self-employed workers, young parents, people with immigrant backgrounds, young adults. Three Coins participated in Impact Hub Vienna programs, including the Investment Ready Program and they pitched at the very first CEE Impact Day 5 years ago. Franz Karl Prüller Franz Karl Prüller, chairman of the board at the Erste Foundation, believes Social Entrepreneurship is ‘the most sensible thing you can do for society.’ Before taking over as chairman of the board, he was the director of the Social Development Programme from 2005 until 2013. Charly Kleissner Dr. Charly Kleissner is an impact investor and impact entrepreneur. He is a co-founder of the KL Felicitas Foundation. Their mission is to enable social entrepreneurs and enterprises worldwide to develop and grow sustainably. He is also on the board of Toniic, the global action community for impact investors. He helped found the 100% Impact Network, a global peer-to-peer network of asset owners, who have intentionally committed 100% of their assets to positive social and/or environmental impact. Also he helped co-found the Central European Investment Ready Program, which helps social entrepreneurs worldwide to accelerate and increase their social impact. He is dedicated to investment and supporting social entrepreneurs and will be present at the upcoming CEE Impact Day where attendees can meet, talk and learn from him. Nikolaus Hutter Nikolaus Hutter is the founder of New Paradigm Ventures (Impact Investment, Capacity Building, and Prototype New Business). He has also been actively involved with Impact Hub Vienna and our programs for over 4 years, as a coach and mentor. With a wealth of experience, he is always willing to offer advice with regards to business development and impact investment. He believes that, ‘in the future, as an entrepreneur or investor, you either create genuine value – financial, social, and environmental – or go out of business.’ Erste Bank It may be surprising to many people that Erste Bank is an Impact Hub Vienna member, they have been since 2012! The Erste Foundation, which is associated with Erste Bank, aims to unite Europe, into a social, cultural and economic area without borders, with all its diverse natural beauty, individualism and identities. They do this by investing in lasting structures and relationships, they reinforce individual and organisational autonomy, they cooperate on an equal footing, they take joint responsibility for the common good. The Erste Foundation believes that a prosperous community provides the basis for social, individual and economic development.

Wenn man sich ihren Lebenslauf ansieht, so könnte man meinen, dass Cornelia schon mit 18 wusste, dass Sie unverschwendet gründen wird. Als gelernte Köchin studierte Cornelia Diesenreiter zuerst “Recht und Wirtschaft” in Salzburg. Auf Grund Ihrer persönlichen Werte von Verantwortung und Nachhaltigkeit und der Liebe zur Natur, hat sie dann “Umwelt- und Bioressourcenmanagement” an der BOKU in Wien, sowie “Design und Innovation for Sustainability” in England studiert, wo Cornelia ihre Liebe für das Konzept von Zero Waste entdeckt hat. In unverschwendet hat sie dann die Erfüllung gefunden. unverschwendet steht für kulinarischen Genuss als Lösungsansatz um unnötige Lebensmittel-Verschwendung zu verhindern. Durch traditionelle Verfahren wie Einkochen und Einlegen werden aus überschüssigen, jedoch stets qualitativ hochwertigen und frischen Früchten, Gemüse und Kräutern, in liebevoller Handarbeit Produkte wie Fruchtaufstriche, Gelees, Sirupe und Chutneys hergestellt. Cornelia, wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für´s Kochen entdeckt? Meine Oma und meine Mama sind exzellente Köchinnen und ich war schon als Kind immer begeisterte Küchenhelferin bei ihnen. Kochen ist für mich etwas sehr Sinnliches und Meditatives. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Im Rahmen meines Studiums “Design and Innovation for Sustainability” habe ich bei einem Zero Waste Projekt an einer Restmüllanalyse teilgenommen, bei der wir 1,5 Tonnen Restmüll in Kategorien aufgeteilt haben. Ich war absolut schockiert, als ich realisiert habe, dass davon 400 kg Lebensmittel waren, teilweise noch einwandfrei genießbar. Ich liebe Lebensmittel und habe nach diesem Erlebnis meine beiden Masterarbeiten zum Thema Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung geschrieben. Was war vorher? Das Kochen oder die Idee mit überschüssigen Gemüse und Früchten etwas zu tun? Kochen und Lebensmittel waren für mich immer schon eine absolute Leidenschaft, die ich sowohl beruflich auch als privat gelebt habe. Die Idee mit dieser Leidenschaft einen Beitrag zu einer Zero Waste Gesellschaft zu leisten, hat dann auch noch meine Liebe zur Umwelt eingebunden. Wo siehst Du dich mit „unverschwendet“ in einem Jahr? Ich hoffe, dass ich heuer mindestens 5 Tonnen Obst und Gemüse unverschwenden kann und sich das Konzept in Wien gut etabliert, damit ich dann in einem Jahr eine Zweigstelle in einer weiteren österreichischen Stadt eröffnen kann, um auch dort regional Obst und Gemüse unverschwenden zu können. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja, ich bin ein sehr neugieriger Mensch. Zusammenhänge und Kausalitäten, zum Beispiel in der Wertschöpfungskette von Lebensmittel faszinieren mich, da man so auch Synergien erkennen kann, wie man Ressourcen besser nutzen kann. Meine Neugierde zeigt sich aber vor allem in meinen ausgefallenen Rezeptkreationen, wie beispielsweise Wassermelone-Basilikum oder Rosmarin-Limette. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Als ich von England nach Österreich zurückgekommen bin, musste ich feststellen, dass es in diesem sehr wichtigen Bereich von Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung noch keine Jobs und nur sehr wenige Initiativen gibt, deshalb habe ich beschlossen mich mit unverschwendet selbstständig zu machen und ich bin sehr sehr glücklich über diese Entscheidung. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Köstlichkeiten, die sowohl Bauern und Bäuerinnen, als auch KonsumentInnen glücklich machen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Zu sehen, wie glücklich unverschwendet Menschen machen kann. Einerseits die Bauern und Bäuerinnen, weil sie nichts wegwerfen müssen und dann meine KonsumentInnen, die sich über eine so köstliche Lösung freuen und sie entweder selbst genießen, oder als Geschenk mit schöner Geschichte weitergeben. Ich persönlich bin am Glücklichsten, wenn ich in der Natur sein kann, in den Bäumen sitze und ernte. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Bruder Andreas, der sich mit vollem Einsatz und Hingabe darum kümmert, dass unverschwendet so wunderschön aussieht, wie es aussieht und mich bei Design, Strategie und wichtigen Entscheidungen unterstützt. Ich bin auch sehr glücklich über die vielen großartigen KooperationspartnerInnen die ich in Wien gefunden habe, mit denen ich gemeinsam an kreativen Projekten arbeiten kann. Z.B. die Wiener Tafel, gartenernte, palme13, Zero Waste Austria, … Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Jeder Tag ist ein Abenteuer und es tun sich laufend so viele neue Möglichkeiten auf, dass ich selbst nur staunen kann und ich bin selbst gespannt, wo mich meine Arbeit noch hinbringen wird, ich freue mich jedenfalls sehr darauf! Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Lebensmittel und vor allem die Vermeidung von Lebensmittelverschwendung ist ein sehr emotionales Thema, da die meisten Menschen das unangenehme Schuldgefühl kennen, wenn sie Lebensmittel wegwerfen müssen, deshalb spricht meine Geschichte viele Menschen an und ich denke, dass man meine Leidenschaft dafür einfach spüren kann und das steckt an. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Ich habe das große Glück, dass die Menschen in meinem Umfeld sehr begeistert sind von meinem Projekt und mich unterstützen wo sie können, dafür bin ich sehr sehr dankbar! Hast Du einen Wunsch? Ich würde mir wünschen, dass ich mit Unverschwendet einen wirklich nachhaltigen Beitrag zur Lebensmittelabfallvermeidung in Österreich und vielleicht sogar irgendwann in Europa leisten kann. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Eine meiner Lieblings Facebook Seiten ist Treehugger, die immer sehr inspirierende und kreative Projekte vorstellen, die unsere Welt ein kleines Stück besser machen. www.unverschwendet.at","June 8, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spoonbanner-edit-600x400.jpg"

But what if I told you I could help you become a time management master by correcting the 5 most common mistakes of effective planning? Yes, it sounds like we are about to serve you a magic potion, which will permanently cure procrastination, but to be honest, effective planning has very little to do with finding the cure for laziness and everything to do with learning how to properly plan. Ready for the big reveal? Here we go with 5 mistakes that will change the way you organize. #1 You Don’t Know How To Prioritize The art of prioritizing is simply a realistic evaluation measuring what needs to be done against the tasks’ level of importance. To keep it simple: the most important task goes on top. But sometimes it is hard to discern which task is actually ‘most important.’ When you have a deadline set by the client, then this task is the most important. When you have a paper to turn in, a newsletter to send, pieces of reports to put together, these are the most important tasks. Essentially, all deadline-dependent activities should be jotted down onto your To Do list as top priorities. It is also a good idea to get in the habit of setting daily, weekly, and monthly goals. You can organize these depending on the amount of effort that will go into the execution of these tasks. Ask yourself ‘What is my goal?’ and once you get that part down, start setting priorities by asking ‘Is this task bringing me closer to my goal? #2 Your Plate Is Too Full Ambition is the driving force behind many actions. But being overzealous, can become problematic when you load your planner with too many tasks. Multi-tasking is a myth and bloodshot eyes are not sexy. #3 Know Yourself The golden rule of following through on your commitments is to be realistic. Would you ever run a marathon without prior experience in running? Would you apply for a CEO position straight out of university? My point exactly. Effective planning means knowing what you are capable of and how much work you need to put in to reap the benefits. Consider the time the entire task should take. Also remember to set yourself a deadline otherwise you will fall into delays and procrastination! Consider how many stages the task has and how much work/time you need to spend on each task. For example, I need to take pictures for the blog post and edit them, write the post, proofread it, and plan post promotion. Consider the resources needed for the job – is my camera working and are the batteries charged? Do I have enough information about the product? #4 You’re Using The Wrong Tools For Planning There is no such thing as ‘a bad way of planning’ because each of us has a unique approach to their organizational system. For some it is a paper notepad, for others Google Calendar is their go to planner. Which method do you use? Ask yourself honestly if your organization pattern has been satisfactory. Are your planning tools fulfilling all the functions or are you still searching for your perfect planning method? Without proper tools, you will find yourself in a situation where you will have crumpled notes with To Do lists, hastily written during your morning shopping trip. #5 The Destination Is Not Exciting Enough So you nailed down your tools, priorities, and assessed the tasks, but something still isn’t working. If success is still eluding you, then planning might not be your main problem. The lingering problem in this case might be your goals. Perhaps your goals are not thrilling enough for you to really go for them. That means its time to rethink your goals or include an incentive. Maybe you are lost under a pile of work and don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Adding progress monitoring to your To Do list might help. I guarantee you that seeing how much you have achieved will provide the perceived value of what you’re doing and spur you on. As somebody smart once said ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail’. What they forgot to add is ‘Failing to recognise the right way of planning makes the whole exercise pointless’. And you can quote us on this.","June 15, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/planningheader-600x400.jpg"

Vor 6 Jahren hat es Roman dann nach Wien verschlagen. Es war ein langer Weg bis er seine Leidenschaft gefunden hat. Nach 12 Jahren als ambitionierter Fußballer und seinem ersten Traum Fußballprofi zu werden, hängte er mit 20 Jahren seine Fußballschuhe an den Nagel und folgte seinem zweiter Traum – professioneller Computerspieler. In dem umstrittenen Egoshooter Counterstrike wollte Roman um die Welt reisen und dabei Geld verdienen. Auch hier hat es nicht ganz geklappt und er hängte die Maus nach 6 Jahren an den Nagel. Sein dritter Traum war selbstbestimmt sowie ortsunabhängig zu arbeiten und dabei etwas Gutes für die Menschen zu tun. Dazu hat er seine Leidenschaften Social Media, Online Marketing und Ernährung miteinander kombiniert. Daraus ist jetzt eine der größten deutschsprachigen Grüne Smoothies & Säfte Plattformen mit knapp 100.000 Facebook Fans und 250.000 monatlichen Website-Besuchern entstanden. Grüne Smoothies sind der einfachste erste Schritt um seine Ernährung und seine Gesundheit zu verbessern. Sie bestehen nur aus Wasser, Pflanzengrün wie Salat oder Spinat und leckeren Früchten. Die beste “Erfindung” im 21. Jahrhundert! Was treibt Dich an? Ich liebe es kreativ zu sein und viele neue Dinge auszuprobieren. Zum Beispiel interessiert mich im Moment das Thema Video sehr stark. Außerdem will ich etwas Gutes für die Menschen tun. Wenn man sich dabei in einem Thema bewegt, das einem seit langem interessiert und selbstbestimmt arbeiten kann, dann hat man den Jackpot geknackt! Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Grüne Smoothies entdeckt? Vor ungefähr 3 Jahren, als ich diese für mehrere Monate wirklich regelmäßig selbst getrunken habe. Du beschäftigst Dich ja schon sehr lange mit Fragen rund um Ernährung, wie ist dann der Fokus auf Smoothies, auf grüne Smoothies entstanden? Ich absolvierte im Jahr 2012/2013 eine Ausbildung zum Ernährungstrainer und war damals auf der Suche nach einem Thema für meine Diplomarbeit. Die grünen Smoothies sind es dann geworden, und am 1.1.2013 startete ich meine eigene 30-Tage-Grüne-Smoothies-Challenge, worüber ich täglich einen Blog verfasste. Daraus entstand dann eine Facebook Seite, welche ziemlich schnell wuchs, als ich täglich Beiträge veröffentlichte. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Der Auslöser war meine Diplomarbeit, aber ich widme mich erst seit einem Jahr zur Gänze meiner Zeit mit diesem Projekt. Wie ist eigentlich die Idee für Dein Buch entstanden? Meine Lektorin hat bei der 30-Tage-Challenge mitgemacht und mich danach angeschrieben. Das Buch ist ja sehr positiv aufgenommen worden? Wie hat das Dein Leben verändert? Überhaupt nicht, außer dass noch mehr E-Mails eintrudeln. Ich bin noch immer derselbe Mensch. Selbst am Bankkonto hat sich nichts verändert, weil die Provisionen erst sehr spät ausgezahlt werden. Wo siehst Du dich mit „grüne Smoothies“ einem Jahr? Mein Fokus wird sich im kommenden Jahr auf meine Namensmarke “Roman Firnkranz” sowie die komplette Ernährung verlagern. Das Projekt “Grüne Smoothies & Säfte” bleibt weiterhin bestehen, aber nach 3 Jahren habe ich mal wieder Lust auf mehr Abwechslung. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Indem ich viel ausprobiere, sehr viel Neues lerne und es gerne auch selbst mache. Zum Beispiel Food-Fotografie, Videos drehen vor und hinter der Kamera oder Bücher schreiben. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? In Österreich geboren zu sein, Zugang zu kostenloser Bildung, Büchern und Google zu haben. Ohne diesen Voraussetzungen wäre ich nicht da, wo ich jetzt wäre. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Es hatte das größte Potential, machte mir am meisten Spaß und es war eine Herausforderung. Ich wollte es unbedingt durchziehen und etwas Vorzeigbares schaffen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es dich nicht geben würde? Die Menschen hätten 200 – 400 Tonnen mehr auf der Wage <U+0001F642> Also mit diesem Juni haben über 100.000 Menschen an meinen Challenges teilgenommen, wobei hier jeder im Durchschnitt 2 – 4 kg abnimmt. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf ein bequemes Leben. Man muss sich sehr häufig Herausforderungen stellen, die nicht immer angenehm sind. Man verbringt definitiv mehr Zeit vor dem Computer als manch andere und die Arbeit beschäftigt einem häufig den ganzen Tag. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Selbstbestimmtheit. Die Kreativität. Die positiven Rückmeldungen der Menschen. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Ganz klassisch meine Eltern, meine Freundin und 3 enge Freunde. Zum Beispiel unterstützen mich mein Vater und meine Freundin bei den Fotoshootings und sie teilen und liken alles auf Facebook <U+0001F642> Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Ja, definitiv. Es ist Vieles geplant. Eigene Lebensmittel-Produkte, lustige Videos, Fernsehauftritte, Internationalisierung und so weiter. Wenn du immer als erster davon erfahren willst, dann einfach hier. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Durch meine undogmatische, lustige und lockere Herangehensweise. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Manche finden es gut. Manche beneiden mich. Manche machen sich darüber lustig, indem sie mich fragen, ob ich schon wieder die Wiese abgegrast habe und manche verstehen nicht, wie man damit Geld verdienen kann. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? In Punkto Ernährung: Grüne Smoothies probieren und trinken. Zum Beispiel einfach mal hier mit der kostenlosen 7-Tage-Grüne-Smoothies-Challenge starten: www.gruene-smoothies.info In Punkto Leidenschaft: Einfach TUN. Einfach anfangen, was sich im Moment richtig anfühlt und durchhalten. Immer weiter machen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Aktuell wünsche ich mir einen 27 Zoll iMac, damit ich endlich ruckelfrei Videos schneiden kann <U+0001F609> Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen besonderen Tipp? Dieses Buch finde ich fantastisch: “Die Heilung der Mitte – Die Kraft der Traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin” vom Wiener Arzt Dr. Georg Weidinger.

She might be a little smaller than the other Hub Members you meet, but she doesn’t let that stop her passion for creating positive change through her new social venture here in Vienna. To get better acquainted, you can check out her earlier blog posts here. Last week Billie was scrolling through her Facebook profile, hoping to find someone to connect with about her new social venture. After an hour of searching for the right community, she realized she didn’t have as much in common with her Facebook friends as she thought. Sitting back in her comfy desk chair, she wished she could find a platform that could connect her with like minded people, people building up social ventures of their own. Billie’s wish came true almost instantly, as she discovered HubNet! Fast Recap: What is HubNet? It is Impact Hub’s network, the place where 10.632 Hub-Members across the world connect with each other and are able to share their experiences, ideas, and resources. Most importantly, everyone on HubNet shares their ventures and projects with their fellow Hubbers. But how do you HubNet? Step 1: Introduce yourself Who are you and what brought you to the Hub community? What are you working on and what are your future plans and goals? Don’t forget to link your HubNet to your other online presence (personal/company website, LinkedIn profile, Twitter account, Instagram). As you develop your profile, other Hubbers have key information that can help you accelerate your business and empower your vision. Step 2: Smile Show us those pearly whites and upload a profile pic. Your fellow Hubbers in Vienna want to know who you are and a picture enables them to recognize you instantly and ask questions about your projects. Step 3: It’s a group thing We are all about community here at Impact Hub so be sure to join the right groups based on your interests. You can search for groups using the search bar or go to the group directory. But what if your perfect niche group doesn’t exist? No problem! Just create a group; some of the other 10.000+ Hubbers might join. Master Tip: Start by joining the How-To HubNet group. This is a space for Hubbers to ask questions and troubleshoot ways to use the Hub Network. Step 4: Notification or Spamification? Be sure to edit your notification settings so you receive the right amount of information from your groups. Getting an information overload isnt sexy. Be sure to target the groups you want to receive updates from. Step 5: It’s a global thing HubNet is the network of global impact makers. By clicking at the home page you have an inside look at what Hubbers are up to around the world. Master Tip: If you are planning to travel abroad make sure to check here to see if there is an Impact Hub in that area. Once you have identified your nearest Impact Hub, simply visit their HubNet community and let them know you will be in town so you can visit the Hub. There is no better souvenir than creating new Hub memories. Step 6: Make your mark Hold on! Wait a second! #DidYouHashTag? Don’t forget to include our community hashtags for highlighting and organizing your post. The key letters here are S.O.C.S: #sharing #offering #connecting #seeking Master Tip: What is the difference between posting on your profile vs posting on Impact Hub Vienna’s group?

The BROTFABRIK building in the 10th district has a beautiful façade. The bricks from the historical bread factory are interspersed with high arched windows, illuminating the high ceilinged interior spaces. Inside you can find beautiful galleries and you guessed, co-working spaces and social projects! The Zero Waste Lab is one such project. A pop-up space for events and workshops, they recently hosted a Zero Food Waste Panel. Organized by the design thinking group OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter, the event was a response to the current Zero Food Waste challenge which is being addressed by the global OpenIDEO network. OpenIDEO is a network of local communities using design thinking to drive social impact around the world. Starting in Singapore, the movement expanded to New York, Palo Alto and Barcelona in 2013. The movement was sparked by a question from the OpenIDEO design community: why aren’t we leveraging the power of face-to-face connection? Since then 40+ cities across the world have joined the global community. Members meet up locally to contribute to online challenges such as the Zero Food Waste challenge, flex design thinking muscles, and participate in workshops to launch social impact projects. The Zero Food Waste panel had a great line up staring three women who are passionate about addressing food waste issues. Alexandra, Helene and Cornelia (from left to right) The first panelist was Alexandra Gruber, who is the managing director of Wiener Tafel, a Viennese not-for-profit association that operates at the intersection of zero food waste and poverty reduction in Vienna. The second panelist was Helene Pattermann, the founder and initiator of Zero Waste Austria, which aims to connect and strengthen zero waste players on- and offline. Through Zero Waste Austria she raises awareness on the topic and gives the zero waste movement a voice. Most recently she has also been organising the pop-up Zero Waste Lab, where the event was hosted. Finally, Cornelia Diesenreiter rounded out the panelists for the evening. Cornelia is the founder of Unverschwendet a social business following a simple, yet effective idea. With her start-up, she saves vegetables and fruits from being wasted by cooking and selling marmalade, chutneys and other products. That way she is able to save tons of eatable food. During the enlightening one and a half hour discussion, Stephan Kardos from the OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter led the group through a series of questions aimed at delving deeper into the topic of Zero Food Waste. Food waste is no easy problem to solve, and the participants walked in already familiar with this critical issue. What struck as particularly surprising, however, was some of the data the panelists referred to when touching on the scope of waste taking place. Cornelia had some interesting insights into the scope with which we are dealing with. “I get phone calls from farmers calling me, saying they have one ton of tomatoes every day.” She explained that she wished she could do more to save the food being wasted. “Its just my capacity, it’s the logistics behind it. It’s too much. And the numbers, they strike me everyday…Its not every now and then. Its every day that I get these phone calls.” Alexandra also had some impressive numbers to share with the group. “Currently we [process] 500 tons of food on a yearly basis, and we serve about 100 charities, with about 18,000C people living in poverty…We could do more, but we would have to enlarge our capacities. For us, our next step is having a warehouse.” The coordination involved, and all the drop and pick up sites, are also limiting factors for the Weiner Tafel. Alexandra expressed wanting to do more, but same as with Cornelia, the logistics posed problems for her organization. Elena, supporting the previous panelists, said that, “one third of the food we buy goes to waste.” She pointed out that it is not only the food that is wasted, “its the money, the time, and the effort. There is a lot of potential in households to reduce food waste.” Keeping those numbers in mind, there was a poll taken of what food items the audience threw out most often from their homes. The results from the poll revealed that audience members threw away fruit and vegetables the most, with 11 participants falling into this category. Stale bread was a close runner up, with 8 participants reporting this as their most tossed food item at home. And finally meat and dairy were also reported as commonly wasted food items, with 3 and 2 participants weighing in respectively. Panelists and OpenIDEO Vienna Chapter Organizers Colorful post-its covering the wall, audience members could see the results of the poll. During the networking session that followed the panel, there was some discussion as to how people could save the food they usually tossed at home. Full of new ideas and inspired by the incredible work the panelists are doing, audience members left the Zero Waste pop-up armed with useful links, tips and tricks on how to reduce food waste in their lives. What food item do you most commonly waste in your home and is there a way you could share or reuse it?","June 29, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/header-2-600x400.jpg"

It is true – Fundacity, the website that connects investors to Start- Ups, told us so! And do you know what makes Impact Hub Vienna so special? Part of the answer is the Accelerator Program and Workshops. What is an Accelerator Workshop? Are you missing a key skill to move your venture forward? Do you want to dust off a previously honed skill by learning new tips and tricks? If so, then the Accelerator Workshops are for you! As part of the workshop program industry experts present a variety of tools, tips, and tricks to help get you and your venture to the next level. They are a great way to network with industry professionals and to connect with your fellow Hubbers. To learn more about the Accelerate Program and Workshops, click here. Communications for Start-Ups As a part of a recent Accelerator Workshop, Dirk Moser and Elisabeth Totschnig of Grayling Austria, pictured above, came to Impact Hub Vienna and gave workshop participants the inside track on communications strategies. Communication strategies for large or small organizations all boil down to two simple questions: What is my message and who am I trying to reach? The answers to these two questions often determine what you are communicating about your business and yourself, how you will communicate with your clients, and where they will see your message. Below are some tips to help you create a solid communications strategy. Persona Approach Take some time to imagine your clients. What do they look like? Where do they work? How do they like to spend their weekends? Once you have the answers to those questions, look more closely at the details of your imagined clients’ lives. In contemplating this you can often find the answers to when they might use your products and when might be the ideal time and formats for your communications. Use Social Media According to Grayling’s data, 4 in 10 customers are more likely to make a purchase after sharing it or favouriting it on social media sites. These numbers look great, especially when you are trying to make an impact with your venture. However, there is a downside to social media: the time that it takes to maintain the content on each site. Be brave enough not to start something – Elisabeth Totschnig A social media site with no developed content for a lengthy period of time detracts from your ability to market your product or service to your clients. From your clients’ perspectives you have stopped talking with them and the relationship degrades. Remember to only take on as much as you can handle and not to overload yourself (or your team mates!). Always Ask Asking people to review a product or service seems awkward and false for many of us. However, 71% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase based on social media referrals. This statistic shows that we should be soliciting reviews of our products and services for our social media sites. We often forget that we have a massive network at our fingertips in HubNet or in person at Impact Hub Vienna. Our colleagues in Vienna and across the world are always very willing to help with your product and service. What Next? When workshop participants were asked what they would start doing the next day as a result of the workshop the most common answer was developing client personas to better target their messaging and their communications strategies. What are you going to do next to help accelerate your venture? We would suggest signing up for the next workshop!

Anything bad is good for you – if we develop the ability and agility to see challenges as investment opportunities and tackle them though impact investing and social entrepreneurship. The CEE Impact Day at Impact Hub Vienna has given strong evidence of this new nascent market paradigm. While the social welfare state has been a successful concept to address the challenges of the 20th century, social entrepreneurship and impact investing may well be the recipe of the 21st century. While many old systems are running dry of money and need to reinvent themselves or die, the movement building works undertaken by pioneers like Charly Kleissner , Impact Hubs, Ashoka and the Social Stock Exchange- to name a few, begin a to win momentum. New forms of co-operation, co-work and a new language are proliferating into investment and social banking. Social Banking and Impact Investing uses the nowadays highly sophisticated instruments developed in investment banking like social bonds, green bonds and pay – for – performance schemes and new intermediaries like the social stock exchange alongside with a strong focus on creating solutions for social and environmental challenges, the world is facing today. The Impact Hub has a centre role in establishing the fertile ground these new potentials. Some examples of how these Social Enterprises can be profitable were presented as award winners at the CEE Impact Day. I have picked Magdas Hotel, a hotel run by 20 refugees and 10 professionals addressing the challenge of migrants to find work. The hotel is a rebuild retirement home, offers rooms in a chilly atmosphere and at the same time a wide range of cultural events. A lot of players support this new field of enterprising and investing like Erste Bank Foundation who has co- initiated the first Social Bond in Austria, Impact Hub who runs various programmes in cooperation with partners like the Investment Ready Programme (IRP) and the Scaling Programme to mane a few. The CEE Impact Day provided strong evidence on how successful the Hub has been in establishing a new eco-system for triple bottom line and impact investing and that it has been a change agent and enabler for social entrepreneurship, NBO and Tec’s. I differentiate the two by the indicator whether or not a sound theory of change is applied. Triple bottom line investment does not necessarily imply a theory of change, impact investment does. Charly Kleissner, Co-Founder of KL Felicitas Foundation reiterated and emphasized the importance of the movement building works in addition to a TBL approach in investing, which needs to go on with investees, investors and intermediaries and develop increased attraction and buy in. Charly himself once again demonstrated in his speech that he is an excellent ambassador, supporter and campaigner for impact investing and social entrepreneurship and announced that he will make available his portfolios for scientific research on impact investing to universities and scientists. Uli Grabenwarter, Deputy Director Equity Investments of the European Investment Fund stressed “ we have to hold ourselves (investors) responsible for the success of impact investees and do everything to support them.","July 6, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blog-Image-Guide-2-1-600x400.jpg"
"53","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/07/getting-started-linkedin/","ImpactHub","Getting started with Linkedin","You probably must have heard that recently Linkedin was acquired by Microsoft, which prompted a lot of people to dust off their Linkedin profiles to be ready for whatever revelation tech giant has in store for the platform. But Linkedin should be your key networking tool regardless of who owns it- with 433 million users, Linkedin is currently the biggest social media platform for professionals in the world. In other words: this is where your future bosses, clients and business partners are. And we will help you join them with this ‘Getting started with Linkedin’ introduction. Why do I need a Linkedin profile? Every time somebody asks me this question, my answer is instantaneous: because without Linkedin you will miss out on being offered a job or finding a new customer base. Whilst in Germany, Austria and Switzerland an alternative networking platform called Xing has a much bigger market share, key international companies and the rest of the world use Linkedin.That alone should get you seriously thinking about joining it! Starting your Linkedin journey When you log into your account will be greeted by a simple layout with user-friendly menu and a clean information feed providing you with recent updates from your network. There is also a small box sat in between menu and the feed, which includes a snippet of your profile analytics and three buttons for quick sharing of updates, photos, and article publishing. Many people like to think of Linkedin as ‘Facebook for professionals’ but the update feed should never be treated the same way. Remember that whilst Facebook is your personal social media, on Linkedin, you are showing your business face. Photos of pugs, albeit extremely cute, will not do. Let’s click through to your actual profile. Unlike any other network, Linkedin requires you to fill in a lot of personal information to boost your profile to an all-star level. This mystical ranking tool not only reminds you what needs to be done to get your profile up to speed- it also rewards you back with increasing your organic visibility in searches. Not to mention that a well-kept Linkedin profile will work to your advantage when people visit it. You can read more about benefits of taking your profile to the next level here. First of all, before you start making any changes to your profile, make sure you turn off ‘Notify your network’ option. To do so, go to your profile and scroll down to see the last box on the right-hand side panel – there will be a switch asking you whether you want your network notified of any updates to your profile. Select ‘No’. As said previously, Linkedin is an extension of your CV. Having an updated CV can give you an idea of what you want to put into your online profile and what you can add extra to to maximize on the Linkedin features. The basics: Profile picture– Use a professional photo rather than a blurred selfie. The ideal photo size is 400×400 pixels. Your headline – This is the title showing under your name at the top of your profile. I have seen users adding in their official job titles, as well as ‘Social Media Wizard’. Always use keywords that describe your job accurately because the headline is searchable and is attached to your name whenever you interact on Linkedin users- make sure it sums up your job at a first glance. Location and Industry – These two options will help Linkedin classify you into categories when somebody searches for, let’s say digital marketers in Vienna. Having current location listed on your profile also means people reaching out to you to offer you local opportunities. Unique URL -Instead of having a random string of numbers and letters, you can customize your URL to include your name and surname. Summary – This box containing maximum 2000 characters is your elevator pitch. Introduce yourself the way you would during a networking event. This particular section allows you to add media (presentation, video, links, visual etc.) so if you want, you can make it interactive. Experience – This is where you will input your professional or work related experience. You can either opt for chronological order or prepare a skill-based portfolio. The same CV rules apply here: be concise, provide results and statistics, use keywords, add media and space chunks of text so it is easier to digest. You can also upload media (video, link, document) and showcase your work visually. Education Languages – Aside from listing languages you can speak, it is also possible to demonstrate your language knowledge by having a duplicate Linkedin profile in that particular language. To do so, click on the black arrow next to the ‘View profile as’ blue button on your profile and select option ‘Create profile in another language’. Go beyond the basic Completing the minimum profile requirements above will be a start, but the more information you include, the closer you get to an all-star profile.To get to that level, you will have to be a bit more generous when it comes to sharing details of any additional education, experience, projects as well as causes you care about. Only 51% Linkedin profiles are completed, so going beyond the basic gives you a competitive advantage. Volunteering Publications– Extremely useful section for researchers and scientists. Projects– If you finished a team project at work or did a small job and do not feel like including it in your work experience, add it to this section. Bonus: you can add members of the team as long as they are your connections on Linkedin. Skills and Endorsements– Your connections can endorse you for certain skills you have added to your profile and you can endorse them back. More about endorsements below. Interests Awards Certifications Being active on Linkedin Once you have your profile filled in, start participating in the community!The most important reason you are on Linkedin to start off with is to connect with people. You can connect with your current and previous co-workers, colleagues, friends, and schoolmates. The more people in your network the wider your circle of 2nd and 3rd-degree connections is, which leads to higher ranking amongst other specialists in the same field. Start from building a base of people you have already met and worked with, ask for references to improve your own profile and seek new potential contacts. You should join groups of professionals within your industry – not only you can get insight on the type of work you do from colleagues abroad, but you can also explore work opportunities in international markets. This could also be a way of showing your expertise and earning credibility within your industry- by belonging to a specialised group, you dig deeper into your industry and create a net of things you have in common with other professionals. To find relevant select ‘Interests’ on the main menu and then ‘Groups’. Linkedin allows you to explore groups from the same industry based on your profile’s information -this is why it is better to complete the profile before you start socialising. Endorsements of skills is also a great way of keeping in touch with your network. Whilst endorsements are not as credible as references, they are an innocent poke aimed at your contacts to remind them of your existence. Chances are, that the person you endorsed will visit your profile back. Well done! You have just taken your first step towards owning an awesome Linkedin profile. Stay tuned for more useful Linkedin advice on our blog!","July 7, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blog-Image-Guide-2-3-600x400.jpg"
"54","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/08/an-impact-ful-day/","ImpactHub","An Impact-ful day","What an incredible day! Each year, the CEE Impact Day gathers global organisations, individual and institutional investors, and selected ventures to explore the growing investment opportunities in the Central and Eastern European region. This year was the 5th anniversary and approximately 120 new and established players gathered at Impact Hub Vienna to participate. It was a unique opportunity for all participants to interact on a one-to-one basis. Everyone was in a celebratory and positive mood when the day kicked off. The keynote speeches We started with Uli Grabenwarter from the European Investment Fund who spoke about the disconnect between traditional investment and impact investment. Uli believes that today, profit is not enough and that investors are also looking for businesses that will give back to society. Investors see these organisations as having a competitive advantage. To this end, impact investment is an enabler and a means to establishing a new way of conducting business that actually serves society. “Venture philanthropy is about matching the soul of philanthropy with the spirit of investing.” This visionary statement was how Ewa Konzcal from the European Venture Philanthropy Association (EVPA) opened her keynote speech. For the EVPA, it is all about matching funding with the right venture. They believe that the ventures (and investors) are out there, but that the connection is missing. EVPA likes to ask ventures – “What would you do if you had all the resources and money to make your dream happen?” – and then set about making this dream happen for them. Cornelius Pietzner from Alterra Impact Finance talked about how there is more to investing than just projections and plans. For him, it is about telling a story and understanding WHY the ventures do what they do, how they interact, their hopes, dreams and feelings. He believes that these things can tell you more about a venture than a 5 year projection. The breakout sessions After this inspirational start we broke into the first of 2 interactive sessions, where participants both learned from, and contributed to, the conversation. A range of impactful business topics were discussed and debated. Participants weren’t shy about asking tough and relevant questions to experts that they would not otherwise have had access to. These groups talked about what investors really wanted and how important financial returns were to them. They discussed investor segments, including geographic location, risks with respects to financial returns and actual impact that they are interested in (education, sustainability, etc). This level of conversation would not have been possible without a facilitated event like CEE Impact Day and participants made sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Before breaking for lunch, we reconvened and groups were asked to give a quick 1 minute review of their session, forcing group representative to be succinct and to the point. By doing this, other participants were able to find out about the other sessions and follow up with any questions during the lunch break. Participants were also able to talk one-one-one with some of the social impact ventures working across Europe, including Robowunderkind, aWATTar, Compuritas and FragNebanan. After being revived by Iss Mich food, participants again broke into breakout sessions. The second round of topics were extremely interesting and participants were forced to choose between the following options: Climate change and sustainability Tech-4-Good Migration & Integration Agriculture and food Ecosystem in the Western Balkans A new feature this year was the inclusion of breakout sessions focused specifically on different regions in Central and Eastern Europe. The Western Balkans and Danube were each given their own breakout session with the aim of promoting investment in the region. These areas are seen as a new frontier for impact investing in Europe. After much debate I decided to attend the Migration & Integration session, which proved to be innovative and informative. We were given updates from a number of groups working in the field, including Magdas Hotel, Refugeeswork.at, younited Cultures and the Austrian Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs & Consumer Protection. All the other groups reported that their sessions were equally as good. The wrap up Everybody reconvened for the final session and participants got intimate – chairs were rearranged and everyone sat in a giant circle, with many people sitting on the floor. The session was hosted by Charly Kleissner of KL Felicitas Foundation and Toniic, who spoke about how far the sector had come and how much was still to be done. Charley then brought things back to an emotional perspective, rather than a financial and logical one. He asked the participants if they were doing what they loved – really loved – and doing it not just because it was successful. He talked about how it was important for all of us to grow in a sustainable way, meaning that the person AND the company could sustain this growth. One must achieve personal satisfaction to continue to grown their organisation. The room was then open for discussion and all participants were invited to give their feedback and opinions. The microphone was passed around and everyone was included and their opinion valued. It was a wonderfully unique opportunity for all in the room to take a holistic look at their career focus and goals. Then finally it was time to kick back, relax and let the learnings of the day sink in.","July 8, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CEEID-Banner-600x400.jpg"

As we grow both locally and internationally, we are seeing a trend, that it’s not enough to work with only Social Entrepreneurs. In order to create sustainable and scalable impact we need to broaden the ‘Impact Hub Ecosystem’ to include all of the stakeholders, from Corporates to refugees, from governments to the unemployed. At Impact Hub we want to work with every stakeholder to create a lasting and growing impact. Unlikely Allies is about making connections and working together to solve any challenge. This is the aim of the Impact Hub Network: to create networks and assist in creating wide, sustainable, and impactful change. Here is a look at what Impact Hub Vienna, its supported ventures, and partners have been collaborating on over the past year. With Hackathons, Workshops, Job Fairs, Formal Investment Programs, and many more options, we are trying to bridge the gaps between social entrepreneurs, their beneficiaries, large corporations, and policy makers. DiploHack Vienna Diplohack Vienna brought together a number of different stakeholders within various communities to discuss the topic of the Refugee Crisis. With the support of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Diplohack brought together refugees, social entrepreneurs, politicians, policy makers and more to discuss and create technical solutions for some of the global challenges the refugee crisis has created. The winning team, made up of Impact Hub Vienna members and refugees, received a clickable prototype of their product and an invitation to Transparency Camp Europe 2016, in the Netherlands, to present their idea and collaborate further! Found! Found! is a new incubation program offered by Impact Hub Vienna, in partnership with Deloitte Future Fund. The vision of found!: “Creating new prospects for the future is essential for the successful integration of refugees. Thus, enabling integration into the Austrian labor market is of special importance. Only by having jobs, people are able to secure a livelihood for themselves and become integrated and productive parts of society.” This partnership with the Deloitte Future Fund is a key example of the importance of collaboration across sectors. It shows the importance of and the value that is created when individuals, teams, large corporations, or governing bodies, collaborate to tackle a challenge together. By joining forces it uses the strengths of each group while remedying some of the weaknesses. Chancen:Reich On June 29, 2016, Chancen:Reich and their partners, took over MuseumsQuartier to hold the first ever Austrian job fair for refugees. The job fair gave refugees and potential employers a chance to connect with and learn about each other. Refugees were able to learn about hiring process from individual employers and employers were able to learn about the rich tapestry of qualifications and experience within the refugee community. Chancen:Reich co-founders say that integration within the broader business community is essential as it creates opportunities for both businesses and displaced persons. Amongst the job fair partners hoping to make connections with qualified refugees were Erste Bank, Rotes Kreuz, Samariterbund, and almost fifty other participants. This collaboration between social entrepreneurs, their beneficiaries, large corporations, and government services has created an ecosystem in which refugees can gain access to well paid employment and businesses can gain new perspectives through hiring internationally qualified individuals. This is just the start. Over the past year we have made some positive steps in this direction, but we are really just at the start of the mountain. We have established some strong connections with Deloitte, The Kingdom of The Netherlands, and more, but there is still a long way to go. We want to collaborate more, we want to broaden the Impact Hub Ecosystem to include everyone from corporations to the beneficiaries. By doing this we can see the whole picture, then and only then, can we help facilitate the creation of long and lasting positive Impact which, after all, is what the Impact Hub Network is all about.","July 8, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WE-Connect-Banner-600x400.jpg"

These stories come from a diversity of people, who run their projects with passion and courage. Hub Members usually live and breathe their projects, so when they achieve success, they feel these successes as the life milestones. Milestones are important because they provide a sense of achievement and progress. Forward progress is one of the best motivations to continue on one’s path, especially during the challenging or unsure moments in ones career. Success stories are also the ones which encourage other people to keep walking their own chosen paths. That is why The Community Hosting Team, decided to establish the Success Board located on the first floor of Impact Hub Vienna. The Success Board The Community Hosts recently erected the Success Board as a response to the inspiration we saw take place when members share success stories, big or small. One person sharing their story had a domino effect, rippling throughout the whole community. We believe that success should be celebrated at the Hub regularly. Therefore we revealed the first successes on June 23rd as a part of the Hub’s Wine-Down. This soon to be repeated event presented the perfect opportunity to present our new Success Board. The Wine-Down is an event which connects (and re-connects) members by giving them an informal atmosphere to talk about their projects, lives, and – of course – their successes; while sharing a glass of wine. The Wine-Down The recent Wine-Down was a success as well; more than 80 members came to enjoy the get-together. In house foodies, IssMich surprised the crowd with their innovative shots, cocktails and lemonades. The ice breaker game, which involved a colored bracelet, enabled Hubbers to get to know one another in a quick and easy way. Judging by the smiles at the event, we can say that the first of the monthly Wine-Downs was a success. Be sure to check out the next one on the 21st of July! Stay Tuned! The Wine-Downs and the Success Board go hand in hand when celebrating member milestones. That is why, as a part of the regular Wine-Down program, we will be announcing recent community successes from the Success Board.

"57","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/13/accelerate-sales/","ImpactHub","Accelerate: Sales","Recently, the Communications Team have been covering our various experiences in the Accelerate Workshops. We wanted to bring you the information first hand, in case you haven’t had time to go or haven’t really thought about it before. You can read our first post about the communication workshop and you can read the Accelerate Program on our website for a bit more information. Is Selling a talent, a skill, or a process? A few weeks ago Ondrej Gandel of Inventures EU gave a sales focused workshop at Impact Hub. Regardless of whether you are offering a product or a service, or something in-between, it never hurts to have a few good sales tips up your sleeve. Sales is a mix of talent, skill, and process. However, good sales people are comfortable asking other for money, having the courage to approach people, and innately knowing which whom to speak, according to Gandel. You need to see who is important in which part of the selling process! Ask yourself who is the person with whom you are speaking. Is she a manager, a product user, a customer? It is important to ask yourself: is just one person involved in the purchase, or do you need to influence other stakeholders in the organization too? Key Characteristics Good sales people have a variety of personal characteristics and skills sets. Below is a list of the most common traits that all good sales people share, according to Gandel. Do you see yourself here? – taking the initiative – listening – being positive – being resourceful – being passionate – being conscious – being alert – being respectful – being persistent – having the motivation to keep learning Sales Process Identify your target audience: Do your research! Make a list of organizations, influential people, and social media networks to target. Try to explore these and then figure a way out how to connect to them. Think about whom you know; and if needed, run some searches through your LinkedIn page and Facebook account. Do you see an entry point? Then it’s time to think about how to approach them. Remember, sales is not just about your product or service. You are engaging in sales whenever you are: – creating partnerships, – seeking investors, – hiring an employee, – selling to a retailer, – or whenever you undertake any activity that involve your brand. Identify key drivers: Gandel further outlines that sales are not something you can learn at the desk; you have to go and speak to people. He shares a curious idea: “They cannot tell you what they want. They however LOVE to talk about problems and that can give you the clues!” Then it is your turn to make sense of it, and figure out how what you are selling can respond to what’s driving your audience. Determine exactly what you are “selling”: Besides having a rough outline of what you are offering, Gandel urges you to learn as much about it as possible! He suggests talking to people of all sorts, from those who directly fall under your scope to people who are seemingly unrelated to what you are selling. Getting to know all about the issue you are responding to and the aspects of your product (or service) will lead you to build better argument and stronger convincing abilities to increase your Sales influence. Benefits: People respond to benefits. Period. Incorporate this as a center of your Sales strategy. Facing Opposition When you are encountering opposition, the best way to proceed is by following these steps below. LISTEN Demonstrate that you are interested and want to understand what the concern is. ACKNOWLEDGE Acknowledge the points that are rightly the matter, then express that you will work towards a solution. EXPLORE Profoundly explore concerns and think of solutions. RESPOND When you are sure you understood the objection and are ready to offer a solution – then respond. Final thoughts Gandel warns us that the internet makes today’s situation a bit misleading when it comes to Sales. Although there is a lot you can do online – he says, he still emphasizes the importance of actually going out and speaking to people. Asking around and finding out more about what your target audience needs, is the surest way you could improve your product or service to meet your consumer’s needs and your market goals. It is important not to mistake the number of ‘likes’ with the turnover – workshop participant. Gandel lastly outlines: being good in Sales is also “an ability to deal with discomfort”. We will get better with experience, but it is important to remain open, have the willingness to learn, and keep persevering.

Er hat an der Universität Innsbruck internationale Wirtschaftswissenschaften studiert und seinen Master in Volkswirtschaftslehre an der Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand abgeschlossen. Stefan hat einige Projekte in Süd- und Südostasien verfolgt und unter anderem die Machbarkeitsstudie für einen Technologiepark an der Pakistan-Austrian University verfasst. In Rahmen seiner Doktorarbeit an der Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien hat er im Bereich Open und User Innovation geforscht und v.a. mit Modellen experimentiert den Wissensaustausch mit Externen zu fördern. WhatAVenture hat es sich zum Ziel gemacht. Teams zu empowern ihre Geschäftsideen iterativ und nahe am Kunden zur Marktreife zu entwickeln. WhatAVenture hat dafür einen webbasierten Innovationsprozess entwickelt, der in sechs Schritten auf Basis einer strukturierten Validierung von der Idee bis zur Investmentreife führt. WhatAVenture hat in den letzten Jahren hierbei mehr als 600 Startups und etablierte Unternehmen in verschiedenen Industrien bei der Umsetzung ihrer Geschäftsideen unterstützt. Was treibt Dich an? Selbstständig zu sein motiviert mich. Es bedeutet für mich Raum zu haben, meine Gedanken und Ideen zu verwirklichen. Am Ende liegt mir aber v.a. der gesellschaftliche Auftrag am Herzen und hier Probleme zu lösen, die für die einen klaren gesellschaftlichen Auftrag erfüllen. Ich glaube daran, dass ein Weg dazu ist, neue Technologien in Kombination mit spannenden Teams aufzubauen. Was ist das Reizvolle dabei? Das Spannende daran ist, sich mit einer Vielfalt an Themen auseinander zu setzen, Lösungen für die unterschiedlichsten Branchen zu suchen und hierbei immer Neues zu lernen. Was war vor “WhatAVenture“? Vor WhatAVenture habe ich mich intensiv mit der asiatischen Kultur auseinandergesetzt. Meine erste Gelegenheit dazu hatte ich während meines Studiums in Thailand. Ich habe an der Chulalongkorn Universität graduiert und war später für die Organisation und Durchführung von Studienprogrammen im asiatischen Raum zuständig. Zusätzlich war ich an der Durchführung der Machbarkeitsstudie für den Pakistan-Austria University Technology Park in Lahore, Pakistan, beteiligt. Ein weiterer wichtiger Ankerpunkt meines Lebens ist die Forschung. Ich habe mich während meines Doktorats intensiv mit der Motivationsforschung und der Anwendbarkeit von „open innovation“ Ansätzen in der Wirtschaft beschäftigt. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Den Auslöser für WhatAVenture gab mir eigentlich mein damaliger Kollege Thomas Funke. Er hatte damals die Idee geboren, einen Entrepreneurship Kurs an der Wirtschaftsuniversität in Wien aufzubauen. Hierbei eben nicht Theorie zu vermitteln, sondern Studierenden eine reale Chance zu geben, ihr Unternehmen zu starten. Der nächste logische Schritt war dann für mich selbst ins Tun zu kommen und eben Unternehmer zu werden. Auslöser für die Gründung war dann die Beobachtung, dass viele Teams systematisch die gleichen Fehler in der Entwicklung ihrer Projekte gemacht haben. Wir dachten uns, dass es dann auch eine systematische Methode geben kann, um Teams dabei zu unterstützen, diese Fehler zu vermeiden. Was sind Deine Ziele mit „WhatAVenture“? Mit WhatAventure verfolge ich das Ziel, ein Unternehmen aufzubauen, das erfolgreich ist. Erfolg bedeutet für mich, für die Zielgruppe einen signifikanten Mehrwert zu schaffen. Wir fokussieren uns hier v.a. auf etablierte Unternehmen. Ziel ist, diese Unternehmen nachhaltig zu begleiten, innovativer zu werden. Konkreter formuliert: Durch state-of-the-art Methoden in der Entwicklung von neuen Geschäftsideen Teams im Ökosystem von etablierten Unternehmen zu empowern, am Markt erfolgreich zu sein. Was braucht es an Unterstützung für Menschen, die ihr eigenes business schaffen wollen? Ein Unternehmen steht und fällt mit dem Team. Je besser das Team, desto höher die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit. Das bedeutet, man braucht Zugang zu einem Pool an Top Köpfen, die einerseits inhaltlich super sind, aber auch die richtige Motivation und Mentalität mitbringen. Was ist eigentlich das Spannendste an Deiner Arbeit mit Start Ups bzw. mit potentiellen Start Ups? Für mich ist das Spannendste daran, ihnen zu helfen ein Problem zu lösen. Hierbei geht es besonders darum, eine nachhaltige Lösung zu finden, die Mehrwert stiftet und dabei neue Technologien nutzt. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Entrepreneurship ist für mich das Thema Nummer 1—es geht hierbei immer um Haltung, eine Lebenseinstellung. Unternehmer sein bedeutet für mich, zu denen zu gehören, die etwas tun und offen zu sein für neue Herausforderungen und Erkenntnisse. Das beschränkt sich nicht nur auf meine Tätigkeit bei WhatAVenture, sondern ist eine Einstellung, die sich durch alle Themen zieht. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich bin neugierig. Meine Neugierde besteht darin, ob und wie man Bestehendes verändern kann und wie Systeme funktionieren. Es geht mir konkret darum, herauszufinden, was ich tun muss, um Altes zu optimieren oder auch zu zerstören und wieder neu aufbauen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Der Welt würden definitiv gute Problemlöser fehlen. Wir entwickeln neue Methoden und Ansätze, um bestehende Systeme zu optimieren und schaffen neue Zugänge, wie man alte Probleme löst. Wir arbeiten daran, wie man den Status Quo neu denken kann und darin sind wir gut. Wo findest Du den Raum, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Der Raum für meine Leidenschaft beginnt in dem Moment, in dem ich aufwache und reicht bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, wo ich schlafen gehe. Den Raum für meine Leidenschaft finde ich immer, wenn ich munter bin. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich verzichte sicher darauf gewisse Hobbys ausleben zu können, wie ich sie gerne ausleben würde. Ich führe keinen luxuriösen Lebensstil und kann auch meine Leidenschaft fürs Reisen nicht so ausleben, wie ich es gerne machen würde. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Es ist ein gutes Gefühl, wenn man eine Herausforderung gelöst hat, dadurch eine neue Ebene erreicht hat und das Unternehmen auf die nächste Stufe heben kann. Das kann entweder bedeuten neue Mitarbeiter einstellen zu können, eine neue Innovationsarchitektur geschaffen zu haben oder ganz einfach Probleme gelöst zu haben. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Zu meinen wichtigsten Unterstützern gehören sicher meine enge Familie, ausgewählte Freunde und Mitgesellschafter. Indirekt aber auch inspirierende Erfolgsgeschichten, an denen man sich orientieren kann und die einen motivieren. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Eine gute Workout Session, Kontextwechsel und dann wieder enge Familie, Freunde und meine Co-Gründer. Wohin wird Dich Deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Da gibt es einige spannende Ideen und Projekte in der Pipeline, die darauf warten verwirklicht zu werden. Es ist aber wichtig zu fokussieren. Mein Überziel ist es, gesellschaftliche Probleme zu lösen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Ich hoffe, dass mir das gelingt. Für mich ist es wichtig eine Vision zu entwickeln und Sinnhaftigkeit aufzuzeigen. Man muss den Leuten eine Rolle geben und einen Rahmen schaffen, in dem sie sich entfalten können. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Um ehrlich zu sein, ist das gar nicht mein erster Orientierungspunkt. Es geht mir zuerst darum, die Sinnhaftigkeit hinter Projekten und Initiativen für mich zu sehen. Der Input von anderen interessiert mich da nicht so sehr, ich bin im Endeffekt derjenige, der die Idee gut finden muss und hinter der Idee stehen muss. Ich differenziere auch stark zwischen dem Unternehmen WaV und mir als Person. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Das Wichtigste ist herauszufinden, wer man selber ist. Wer seine klare Identität gefunden hat, kann eine wahre Passion entwickeln und verfolgen, ohne sich dabei von gesellschaftlichen Normen abhalten zu lassen. Man sollte immer daran arbeiten seine Identität zu schärfen, um Passion zu entwickeln. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp,…? Das beste Buch, das ich jemals gelesen habe und ich wirklich empfehlen kann ist: Aging Well, G. Vaillant. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Elon Musk und sonst jeden, der eine coole Story zu erzählen hat.","July 19, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/header-3-600x400.jpg"
"59","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/20/a-personal-experience-on-shades-tours/","ImpactHub","A Personal Experience on SHADES TOURS","Ever since I started working at the Impact Hub in Vienna, I have been meeting people with incredible ideas and businesses. One such person is Perrine Schober of SHADES TOURS. For those of you that have not met Perrine, or heard of SHADES TOURS, here is a bit of background. SHADES TOURS offers activities and tours that discuss homelessness in Vienna. I attended the first tour given in English. The tour was a highly interactive experience led by one of Vienna’s homeless (or houseless). The English tour took us to three locations in the fourth and tenth districts of Vienna, the Hauptbahnhof, outside Caritas Peace Haven, and a local park. The tour started off at Wien Hauptbahnhof. A group of us from Impact Hub were on the tour that beautiful, sunny day. Initially, we met in front of the train station but it was warm and sunny, so we moved through the train station to the other side, where it was shady. While we walked through the train station, I saw a homeless man with all of his possessions attached to a bike, it was a sharp contrast to the beautiful sunny day outside and the camaraderie of the tour guests. As we stood in the shadow of the train station our guide asked us questions about how people became homeless and what homelessness meant. The tour group and our guide discussed why the train station is a gathering place for the city’s homeless population and the stories that unfold there daily. At the train station we were also introduced to the concept of the Street Management Teams. These teams comprise of dedicated social workers, who help those at risk access the social services available to them. Since the tour, I have seen these red jacketed social workers throughout the city. It seems that not only homelessness can appear invisible, if one does not know what to look for. Coming from Canada, the idea that there are social workers going out into the field to help people access social services is a most novel concept. For us, those at risk need to seek aid first, in order to receive assistance. The second location was the Caritas Peace Haven. For a Canadian, this is, again, a very novel concept. We have homeless shelters that sometimes provide accommodations at night, and most especially during our harsh winters, but the idea that there was a day centre where people could access food, internet, showers, and laundry was something new. For us, it is rare to find one place that offers all of these amenities under one roof. Our guide explained to us that there were different types of day centres for women and children in the city as well, so that those especially vulnerable, would be less wary of accessing these safe havens. The third location was a local park. Our guide showed us pictures of the parks during the refugee influx and what they looked like during the height of the crisis. We sat on benches in the shade and discussed the idea of a sense of security and peace that we have in our daily lives but that the homeless lack entirely. Our guide then switched gears slightly to share some stories about some of the individuals that he knew within the city. The stories were eye-opening and disheartening. From stories about theft and the acquisition of new addictions, to the role of mental illnesses and the length of time that homelessness persists for some individuals. Then our guide told us the uplifting success stories of those same individuals. Some are no longer homeless. By accessing the support of social workers and mental health professionals, they slowly built the skills necessary to return to a more normal life. I walked away from the tour with three things on my mind on that beautiful, sunny day. The first was a new understanding of the complexity of homelessness. Many of us look over the person who sleeping in the park or sitting asking for change on the steps. Rarely do we think about the depths of their anxiety over the safety of themselves and their belongings. I also came away with the knowledge that there are a large number of social institutions working together to create and maintain a social system for the homeless within Vienna. There is a large network of well funded charities and governmental social services that work in concert to address this issue. While this does not solve the deep seated problems of homelessness, it certainly makes a difference to the individual lives they touch. The third take away was the difference between homelessness and houselessness. Houselessness being that someone has an address but for various reasons, like domestic violence, he or she is unable to access his or her residence. This is not a concept that we have in Canada, and so, while it is mundane for Austrians to make this distinction based on a variety of factors affecting someone’s status it is not so for a Canadian. I caught up with Perrine after the tour and was able to ask her a few questions about Shades Tours and her guides. What is the most pressing issue with homelessness? “In my opinion, the most dangerous thing about homelessness is time. The longer a person is homeless, the more difficult is becomes for the person to change their status quo. It takes unbelievable strength, motivation, and determination to get out of being homeless when you battle a lack of belief, hope, motivation, strength, and self esteem coupled with unbearable shame and the constant struggle to organize the most basic of needs.” What is the one thing that can make a difference in the lives of the homeless? “Even with all of our social services assisting with the basic needs of the homeless there is one thing that makes a difference to a person who is homeless: employment. Employment is often the difference between homelessness and a fully integrated life. We all need tasks and work in order to feel useful, and to have a reason to wake up and shower everyday. This is not something that the social system can provide, or even is supposed to provide. I do not think that employment is a panacea to homelessness, but when they are ready and back on their feet, they should be able to find employment within the labour market.” What are you proud of with Shades Tours? “I am super proud of the Shades Tours guides. They may be fighting the toughest fight of their lives and I am glad that SHADES TOURS is one employment outlet that can provide them with the strength and motivation that they need.” *********** If you haven’t been on a SHADES TOUR yet, I encourage you to attend one. Austrians have created an amazing social system, and it is important to see it in action. For the rest of us, we need to take these ideas elsewhere in the world and replicate them. Check out the Shades Tours website for information on tours and activities in English and German.","July 20, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/headerfinal-1-600x400.jpg"
"60","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/21/mastering-art-habits/","ImpactHub","Mastering the Art of Habits","The buzz words self-optimisation and maximum productivity have everybody on the road to constant improvement. Every entrepreneur knows that to achieve success, sole motivation is not enough – it’s the perseverance that keeps you going and working despite the difficulties of managing a company. However, keeping high levels of productivity up can become a solid part of your daily routine, if you manage to flip the magic switch and make certain activities into habits. “Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.” - Jim Ryun What are habits? According to Wikipedia, a habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. The thoughtless aspect is what makes habits so desirable. Think back to the times when you were trying to start cutting down on sugar or get up at 5 am every day to go to the gym. Initially every time you were faced with a decision, either to skip your regular spoonful of sugar in your coffee or wake up at this ungodly hour to fulfil your promise, your mind would spill a considerate amount of pros and cons giving you a choice. Sometimes its not beneficial to be given a choice, because our resolve can be weakened by naturally occurring internal questioning. Inner monologues waste cognitive involvement in something that should not have been so engaging; sometimes you even allow yourself to be talked out of your resolution. A habitual behaviour assures that you do things without paying too much attention to them, therefore the opportunity to back out does not present itself. The main reason we need habits when working, is to create a solid net of behaviours, which automatically keep us on track and in control. It is easy to slip when we let ourselves debate between working or not working. It’s completely painless to form a bad habit because with bad habits we tend to just play along. It’s the positive habits that bring benefits for us, that require more work. How to create a habit? When I started my hunt for the best methods to reinforce good work habits, I was googling ‘habits that generate success’ to emulate what the biggest achievers did to stick to their plans. Ultimately…I could not find an answer. I read about how Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs reached their success and created amazing companies, led countless numbers of projects to success end results and became legends of entrepreneurship. But how did they actually establish their exercise, analysis, team working, innovation, creative thinking habits? Then I came across the book ‘Better than Before’ by Gretchen Rubin. In her book, Gretchen debates different types of personalities that naturally predispose us to be susceptible to certain habit forming tactics. Did you notice that some people are able to seamlessly stick to a routine and work themselves into a habit? Maybe you consider yourself chronically unable establish a routine for a longer amount of time? If you fall into this category, Rubin’s 4 Habit Personalities will be especially insightful for you. Types of habit personalities We often forget that there is no magical cure-all because each of us is different. We have different aspirations, characters, and learning styles. This idea also applies to habits! There is no all-in-one solution that will reinforce your habit. No mantras, spells, or exercises, just plain knowing yourself and how your mind works before embarking on a life changing project. Gretchen Rubin came up with a habit tendency framework, which distinguishes four types of habit personalities. These personalities pinpoint conditions that have to be met for a habit to stick: Upholders respond readily to outer and inner expectations Questioners question all expectations; they’ll meet an expectation if they think it makes sense Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike Obligers meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet expectations they impose on themselves This simple framework points towards the right external and internal circumstances for a habit to settle in. For example, a friend of mine has no issue fulfilling her promises to someone else, but whenever she decides on a new workout routine, she drops it within a week. She is a classic Obliger. I suggested she hires a personal trainer, who will hold her accountable. I checked in with her three weeks later and she is continuing her training! After reading the book and finding out all about the four tendencies, I realized that my personality matches that of a Rebel. Initially I was worried about being against any type of binding commitments to myself and other people. Then I worked out that I can only truly commit when I am 100% convinced the habit I am trying to set in stone is worth working on. This encouraged me to be less harsh on myself when it comes to committing to long working hours. The result was letting myself be flexible with my schedule. Ironically, this caused my productivity to go up and I stopped complaining about never having time for myself. If you are struggling to implement a positive work habit, maybe it is because the strategy you took is not matching your habit personality? To find out your habit tendency, take the quiz here!

People are talking about this on business development forums, at conferences, on blogs, on news media sites, and at the dinner table. Impact Hub Vienna is not immune to this trend and we aim to bring you the best information possible to navigate this new business opportunity. A few weeks ago, Aneta posted an article on getting started with LinkedIn (which you can read here if you still don’t have a profile). This week we wanted to give those of you who have not looked at your profile in a little while, okay, a long while, reason to do so. In fact, we wanted to give you ten very good reasons. Tell the World: Dusting off your profile and your previous job information gives you a chance to reinvigorate your profile to reflect the exciting things you are now doing. You should tell the world all about it and LinkedIn is the perfect way to do so. Create new connections: An updated profile means that your network gets notified to the changes that you have made in your profile page (or your company’s profile page). This update notification means that you and your business are fresh in the minds of your network contacts. The next time your field of expertise comes up in conversation with a potential client or investor that is outside of your network, you are at the forefront of your contacts’ minds. New opportunities: Use LinkedIn’s search function to find member profiles, both individual and institutional, that have a history of social impact investing. An updated profile can help potential investors determine if they want to invest in you or your company when you find them. Share and share alike: Just like with HubNet, you can see what others within your field are doing. You can also exchange ideas with the millions of users in the broader business community on LinkedIn. Great minds think alike: Groups are a more detailed and intimate way to share information within your networks. HubNet has them and so does LinkedIn. Groups allow you to expand your network to include the members with the groups and this further expands your network reach. Manage your Brand: LinkedIn allows you to create your own individual profile page (and your organization page) as well as subsidiary pages. This means that you can create targeted pages and messaging for different groups and aspects of your network. Create Brand Traffic: The features within LinkedIn make it one of the easiest and least expensive ways to build and manage a brand for your company. You can post photos and videos, as well as link your websites, blogs, and twitter feeds all in one convenient location. This also assists in developing a brand following for your company or product through more social media sharing; which means more traffic, in general, for your site. Stop the Silent Treatment: In a post from two weeks ago we discussed the need to keep talking to your customers through social media sites, and LinkedIn is one of them. If you have a profile, but have not updated it in a long time, it is the same as if you stopped speaking to everyone in your professional network. Remember that these are potential clients and investors and you have to continue to build a relationship with them; updating your profile is a good way to do that. Come Find Me: According to Forbes Online and LinkedIn Pulse updating your profile can boost you and your company to the top of google search lists. Refreshing your profile and Search Engine Optimizing can get your company higher on the list of returned Google search items; that is good exposure for any social start up organization. We’re Here: That is right, Impact Hub Vienna is following our own advice and we are refreshing the content of our LinkedIn profile. Come find us on LinkedIn and follow us. Our new profile will be launching next week!","July 25, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CoffeeCountDown-copy-600x400.jpg"
"62","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/07/26/teresa-hammerl-wer-braucht-einen-klassischen-lebenslauf/","ImpactHub","Teresa Hammerl: Wer braucht einen klassischen Lebenslauf?","Teresa Hammerl arbeitet als Journalistin und Silicon Valley Korrespondentin. Auf Twitter findet ihr Teresa unter @colazionearoma. Aufgewachsen in Wien lebt Sie derzeit in San Francisco. Besonders interessiert Teresa alles, was im Internet passiert, da vor allem Social Networks wie Facebook, Instagram oder Twitter. Teresa ist Co-Founderin von Fillmore.at, einem Online Magazin, das sich mit Themen aus dem Silicon Valley und dem deutschsprachigen Raum beschäftigt. Außerdem ist sie für die täglichen News aus dem Silicon Valley auf t3n.de und bei unterschiedlichen Projekten auch für Social Media Content verantwortlich oder als Bloggerin tätig. Teresa war auch bereits Co-Organisatorin bei unterschiedlichen Events, wie dem Startup Weekend Vienna oder dem Betapitch Vienna, ehrenamtlich ist sie in San Francisco für Projekte wie das Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival oder die Reading Partners tätig. Welche Leidenschaft treibt Dich dabei an? Ich weiß nicht, ob man das Leidenschaft nennen kann, aber ich mag es, andere Menschen dabei zu unterstützen, neue Dinge zu lernen oder etwas besser zu verstehen. Nachrichten aufzubereiten gehört dabei für mich genauso dazu, wie jemanden dabei zu helfen, Programmieren zu lernen oder einer Volksschülerin, etwa gemeinsam mit den Reading Partners hier in San Francisco, beim Erwerben von besseren Lesefähigkeiten zu helfen. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Journalismus entdeckt? Meine Großmutter hat mir immer von ihr selbst geschriebene Geschichten vorgelesen. Das hat mich sehr früh dazu gebracht, dass ich selbst angefangen habe zu schreiben. Irgendwann habe ich dann gemerkt, dass ich mich für Reportagen interessiere und habe begonnen selbst welche zu schreiben. Das war als Jugendliche, später habe ich Texte ins Internet gestellt. Warum gerade dieser Beruf? Heute finde ich den Beruf der Journalistin besonders deswegen spannend, weil man Missstände aufzeigen kann und mit etwas Glück die Möglichkeit hat, Dinge zum Besseren zu verändern. Klappt das nicht, dann hat man mit Worten die Chance auf etwas hinzuweisen. Außerdem finde ich es gerade jetzt sehr spannend, wie sich der Beruf in der Zukunft entwickeln wird. Facebook Live und Periscope, VR und 360 Grad Videos werden bald Teil des Alltags sein, wobei es interessant sein wird, wie sich all das integriert. Was ist das Reizvolle am Medium Blog für dich? Dass alle einen Blog anlegen können. Das klappt auch ohne Vorkenntnisse zu haben. Wenn man keine besonderen Designvorstellungen hat oder an anderen Feinheiten interessiert ist, sondern nur einen Text online stellen will, geht das sofort. Theoretisch. Praktisch gibt es da aber trotzdem viele Hindernisse, sei es gesperrte Plattformen in manchen Ländern, Hasskommentare oder individuelle Probleme, für die niemand zuständig ist. Darüber sollte man mehr sprechen. In einem Artikel schreibst du, dass du nie zur Schule gegangen bist. Wie hat sich diese Tatsache aus deiner Sicht auf deine berufliche Laufbahn ausgewirkt? Sehr stark. Ich habe mir immer einen nicht ganz so leichten, individuellen Weg ausgesucht, den zuvor noch nicht so viele gegangen sind. Ich lege keinen Wert auf einen klassischen Lebenslauf oder den linearen Karriereverlauf. Wichtig ist mir vielmehr, dass ich niemals aufhöre dazuzulernen und mir Wissen selbst aneigne. Mit vorgegebenen Strukturen kann ich nur schwer umgehen. Was muss sich aus deiner Sicht am Bildungswesen ändern, um Kinder und Jugendliche besser auf Leben & Beruf vorzubereiten? Ich glaube, dass es wichtig ist, das Bildungssystem im Gesamten zu überarbeiten, statt immer nur kleine Veränderungen vorzunehmen. Mehr Praxis ist ein ganz wichtiges Thema, bei Prüfungen habe ich oft nicht verstanden, warum ich etwas erlernen muss, das ich mir im Detail kaum merken werde, obwohl ich viel lieber andere, für mich interessante Themen vertieft hätte. Das Lernen zu lernen ist des Weiteren meiner Meinung nach einer der wichtigsten Aspekte. Dazu gehört es ebenso zu wissen, wie man etwas auf seine Richtigkeit überprüft. Eine Fähigkeit, die man als Journalistin benötigt und die man schon in der Schule lernen sollte. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Na klar! Ich glaube, das gehört zu meinem Beruf dazu. Ich glaube, ich bin besonders gut beim stillen Recherchieren, wie ich es nenne. Dazu gehört es, dass ich Google Tools (zum Beispiel die umgekehrte Bildersuche), Web Archive benutze, Informationen von öffentlichen Stellen erfrage oder einfach nur Firmendaten anschaue. Manchmal liegen Auffälligkeiten direkt vor einem, trotzdem muss man sie erst einmal erkennen. Wer sind deine derzeitigen Energietreiber? Das ist gar nicht so einfach zu sagen, da ich im Moment etwas an Motivation verloren habe. Als freie Journalistin ist man oft in so einem Schwebezustand, in dem man sich eine Redaktion, mit der man über Ideen sprechen kann, herbei wünscht. Ich weiß aber mittlerweile, dass ich selbst meine größte Energietreiberin bin. Wenn ich nicht selbst von dem überzeugt bin, was ich gerade mache, dann weiß ich, dass es Zeit ist, sich nach einem neuen Weg umzusehen. Du beschreibst dich immer wieder als „Internetmensch“. Ist es dein Beruf oder deine Berufung? Ich glaube, dass es weder noch ist. Vermutlich ist es aber hilfreich, als Journalistin heute auch mit dem Internet umgehen zu können. Weil es mir auch noch großen Spaß macht und ich ständig neue spannende Aspekte entdecken kann, bezeichne ich mich gerne als Internetmensch. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich arbeite stets gerne von zuhause aus, weil ich mich da gut konzentrieren kann und nicht von meinem Umfeld abgelenkt werde. Auf der anderen Seite fehlt mir dann immer wieder Inspiration, weshalb ich auch gerne in unterschiedlichen Coworking Spaces bin. In San Francisco ist das etwa das Workshop Cafe. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Vielleicht auf Sicherheiten, einen geregelten Arbeitsalltag und ein fixes Einkommen. Ich habe allerdings nicht das Gefühl, dass ich wirklich auf etwas verzichten muss, für mich ist das, was ich dafür bekomme, eine Bereicherung. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Wissen, dass man dank dem Internet und einem gut aufgebauten Netzwerk schnell und mit etwas Mühe eine Vielzahl an Menschen erreichen kann. Texte und Bilder zu gestalten, die etwas erreichen können, ist sicherlich einer der besten Momente in meinem Beruf. Außerdem ist es toll, viele neue interessante und kreative Menschen kennenzulernen. Mir ist es dabei besonders wichtig, vielleicht abseits von so manchem Trend, nicht stets mit den gleichen Personen oder Führungskräften zu sprechen. Was ist das Schwierigste am Freelancertum? Für mich war am Anfang die größte Herausforderung Kunden zu finden, mit denen man für mehr als nur einen Artikel zusammenarbeiten kann. Dieses Problem tritt auch jedes Mal wieder auf, wenn ich mich noch einmal neu orientiere. Mit der Zeit bekommt man aber mehr Erfahrung und hat sich auch mehr einen Namen in der Szene, bei mir ist das der deutschsprachige Raum, gemacht. Wichtig ist dabei, sich nicht unter seinem Wert zu verkaufen, sondern zu wissen, was man kann und das auch zu sagen. Was nicht ausgesprochen ist, kann das Gegenüber nicht wissen. Marketing für sich selbst zu machen, ist immer wieder ein nicht ganz so einfacher Punkt des Freelancerdaseins. Aber auch hier hilft das Internet sehr. Wohin wird Dich deine Reise noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Gemeinsam mit Elisabeth Oberndorfer führe ich ja unser Online Magazin Fillmore und wir nehmen uns im Moment die Zeit, um herauszufinden, wo unsere Ziele sind. Außerdem überlege ich im Moment, wie lange ich in San Francisco bleiben möchte und wie meine Zukunft hier aussehen wird. Also ja, geheime Projekte gibt es auf jeden Fall, ich muss auch selbst noch herausfinden, welche das genau sind. Wie gelingt es Dir, Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Wenn ich in der Vergangenheit dachte, dass es mir gelungen ist, dass ich jemanden zu Social Media Kommunikation gebracht habe, dann war das deshalb, weil ich persönliche Geschichten erzählt habe. Meiner Erfahrung nach funktioniert es also am besten, wenn ich positive, aber auch negative persönliche Beobachtungen teile, die etwas Abstraktes greifbarer machen. Außerdem finde ich es stets wichtig, dass das Gegenüber Fragen stellen kann und man, soweit es möglich ist, diese beantwortet. Man soll gegenseitig voneinander lernen können. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Mein Umfeld ist immer interessiert an dem, was ich mache und findet es auch spannend, denke ich. Außerdem arbeiten viele meiner Freundinnen und Freunde in einem ähnlichen Gebiet, für die ist das, was ich mache, auch ganz normal. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Tipp? Wer nach San Francisco kommt, sollte in den Botanischen Garten im Golden Gate Park gehen. Anschließend bietet sich ein Kaffee im Stable Cafe an. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Ninia LaGrande, Rotraut Schöberl und Carina Wetzlhütter.","July 26, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/header-2-600x400.jpg"

The summer months are always quiet at Impact Hub Vienna. Many Hubbers go on holiday, work outside or just relax and enjoy the weather. Some of you may think that these breaks from work are ‘bad’ and that they give you guilty feelings that you are ‘not working hard enough,’ but many scientific studies have shown the importance of having breaks and taking trips. But what are some of the BENEFITS of taking a break? Breaks make you happy! Breaks help you re-evaluate your goals Breaks help you make new connections in your brain Breaks help you generate new ideas Breaks give you a fresh outlook on your problems And once more because its important – breaks make you happy! It is hard to quantify the value of longer breaks and holidays from work, yet we can see it is a regular practice within many companies. Every 7 years designer, Stefan Sagmeister takes 1 year off to reassess his work and his priorities, he even did a TED Talk on the idea! Other companies often take company retreats for example, in 2015 Buffer spent $111,874 on their company retreat to improve interpersonal connections. Not too shabby. Like these companies, we at Impact Hub Vienna understand this and actively encourage our team and members to take regular breaks, both privately and as a team. What’s more is that our members agree with us, and some even offer opportunities to take breaks with them! Naleia Yachting, run by Dominik Sarapata, is a week of sailing for people who want to recharge their batteries, meet easy going, open-hearted people and experience friendship and bonding with total strangers. It is a week of exploring wild and secluded bays, eating in cosy, local restaurants and retreating to an adventurous life driven by the forces of the nature. Valentin Heppner from Alpine Verein, organises a wide range of tours and activities in nature. He recently organised a rafting event for the Impact Hub Vienna community, if you take a tour with him you are sure to have a fun adventure! Authentictys is an online platform based at Impact Hub Madrid that connects visitors with local and unforgettable experiences. They are recent participants of the Impact Hub Scaling Program and they design and host experiences with our community of entrepreneurs to curate an incredible time that is sure to leave a positive impact in the city.

When we thought about the space we have available here, we decided to take some inspiration from the art world and try a different tact. You may have noticed that we have been searching for artists, designers and creatives and offering them space to display their work. Our space is perfect for showing off Vienna based artists and we are excited to welcome them into our community. The deal is that we give these artists a space to exhibit their work for free and they get 100% of the profit if a piece is sold. Pretty solid deal if you ask us. We put out the call a while back and it generated a lot of interest. Photographers, illustrators, designers, artists and print makers all submitted their portfolios and we were astounded at the talent that exists in Vienna. We narrowed it down and are proud to introduce you to the 4 artists selected. Works from these artists will be displayed throughout Impact Hub Vienna later this year. Michaela Putz is a multi-media artist. Her work deals with social systems and the institutional context where they are used. For example, she analyses rituals within child-welfare or patient-doctor interactions and sees how those rituals change human relationships. While studying printmaking in Vienna, she created graphic works and large-scale installations, which serve as mappings of these influences on the subject. You can check out her work here. Guilio Paolini is a photographer. Giulio Paolini is an applied and artistic photographer. His work seeks to interact with people and their artifacts on a stronger more visceral level, in order to bring out the social dynamics that lay behind them and make them visible. For instance, in his ‘Next Generation’ series he seeks to engage people in a conversation about their digital personas and their instincts. You can see his work here. Barbara Moura is an illustrator. Barbara Moura is a full time dreamer and illustrator based in Vienna. The main subjects of her illustrations are usually feminism, sexuality, world problems or emotional struggles, often personalised by self-portraits. View her portfolio online here. Pauline Louise Noemi Jocher is a graphic designer. She is interested in extraordinary surfaces and details. Organic inspired structures comprise the fundamentals for her drawings and prints. Pauline’s goal is not to depict the subjects as they are, rather as she imagines them in perfection. Check out her work here.

The social network we all know about is up to do good! The platform is now actively investing in promoting social change among its more than 300 million users. LinkedIn For Good, is a service used to connect people in need, to people with skills and willingness to help them. It’s all part of their desire to increase volunteerism and create social change, with human capital. And we are totally on board. If the 10 reasons we gave you to dust off your profile wasn’t enough, this is another great reason to do so! So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get down to business. Here is an easy—and fun—step-by-step* guide to get you on board with us: Step 1 — We can have lots of fun Let’s impact the world together. “Social impact organizations—social entrepreneurs included—are notoriously strapped for resources, but they are also some of the most innovative individuals in the world,” acknowledges Bob Spoer from LinkedIn. How do you get talent to help you on your mission to change the world? LinkedIn teamed up with VolunteerMatch to fill in this gap using its social network platform. One way is by allowing its members to showcase the causes they are passionate about on their profile, and whether or not they are interested in volunteer work. Another feature is to enable members to browse through non-profit and volunteer job listings the same way they would do with any other kind of job. “Imagine the collective impact of each of our 300 million members finding and acting on one volunteer opportunity on LinkedIn—it could create transformational social impact,” says Spoer. Action: Find people that are as passionate about your cause as you are, and have a set of skills that you need to move forward with your start-up. Or contribute to a cause you love. Join groups on LinkedIn! Step 2 — There’s so much we can do True story. Who has the time to create and maintain yet another social media platform? But we are here to help. The best thing you can do is to divide and conquer. Don’t try to do all at once. Make a plan, for example, Day1: work on your profile; Day 2: Join Groups; Day 3: Follow organizations and potential investors. Laura Shin, who is a career adviser and finance writer genius, devised 5 smart ways to use LinkedIn and get the most out of it. In addition to making your profile findable and visually appealing, make sure you connect strategically and stay active on the site. Laura advises us to “remind your contacts that you’re doing good work by regularly sharing links relevant to others in your industry, keeping your profile current, and updating your profile when you are hired for a new position or have another accomplishment to tout.” Action: To get you started, we will help you follow her first tip: To make your profile visually appealing and findable. If you don’t have a nice picture to use on your LinkedIn profile, come talk to us. We can help you out with it. We can also use this photo to get you up on our new Success Board at the Impact Hub. As for your headline, which runs right under your name, don’t only state your current job position as most people do. It is better to be more creative. Describe what you do, or write about your skill set, using keywords you would search for in your field, and keep it short, like a tweet. Step 3 — It’s just you and me We are following our own advice. Impact Hub Vienna is working on its LinkedIn presence to get the most of it. If the platform is up to do good and is offering opportunities to create even more impact, we are in! We have already revamped our profile page and changed the text that introduces what we do. We are also working on a better picture that represents who we are, and we are now making connections with the most important people – this means you. Our members first! And that’s why we want you with us. We are more than 400 like-minded people at the Impact Hub Vienna alone. Once you complete your profile, don’t forget to find us there too. Action: This one is easy: Connect with Impact Hub Vienna, here is the link for you. Step 4 — I can give you more We are the most connected hub in the world. That’s right! We strive to get connected with other hubs all over the world. We believe in collaboration and movement-building. One of our goals in getting more active on LinkedIn is to get you exposed to the right people. Besides connecting to Impact Hub members around the globe, we want to connect with the start-up scene here and abroad, to link to our current partners, meet potential investors and forge new relationships. Action: If you have any suggestions of who you want us to be connected with or any company that would benefit our community, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Step 5 — Don’t you know that the time is right? If you are still skeptical about it consider this: every second two new members join LinkedIn. The platform is growing at a fast rate, and will keep this trend going now that Microsoft has bought it for no less than 26 Billion dollars…in cash! LinkedIn is definitely worth paying attention to. It’s super useful for anyone who’s either searching for a job, trying to network with like-minded individuals, or starting a company. LinkedIn offers many resources for entrepreneurs, such as groups, including the very popular “On Startups” group that has over 54,000 members. Branded properly, entrepreneurs can attract the right kind of business opportunities and talents. You can also search for service providers or partners there. Plus, for any kind of career opportunity, Laura Shin says, “whether it be a new job, speaking engagement or collaboration, a professional online presence is needed for. And a LinkedIn profile, done right, can be that much-needed online resume, that helps ensure the good work you do is publicly recognized and that others know how to reach you with relevant opportunities.” Action: Create a group and be part of a community. Make sure you share consistently to your LinkedIn company page and profile by for example scheduling your posts.

As you might have guessed it, Impact Hub Vienna is now offering weekly yoga classes. Every Tuesday morning, you can relax and reinvigorate at the Hub, setting you up for a productive and stress reduced work week. Classes are held by two wonderful yogis Elena Popov and Annemarie Punschart. I recently attended one of Annemarie’s morning classes and got to catch up with her about her yoga journey and how she ended up at Impact Hub Vienna. Originally from Austria, Annemarie recently moved back after spending the past 21 years in New York City and Colorado. She is a dual citizen and considers herself to be an “Austro American,” a real mash up of both cultures, as she has spent such a significant amount of time in both countries. She learned about Impact Hub Vienna a while back and was impressed by its “positive, upbeat, inspiring and collaborative” vibe, where members were working together, “in support of a more sustainable world.” She was hooked and couldn’t wait to get involved. What sparked your interest in yoga? I started doing YOGA in the Jivamukti tradition in the early 90s when I was living in NYC. At some point all the “Sex and the City” women were all doing yoga, so then I simply had to follow the trend as a true New Yorker. Practicing yoga and becoming an instructor are very different. Why did you decide to teach? After a devastating skydiving accident in 2003, I experienced a broken spine, spinal surgery, serious nerve damage to inner organs and a broken leg bones. This experience dramatically and mindfully turned my connection to body, spirit and community. Yoga helped me get my broken body and mind back in line, all of the sudden it also was not just about the movements and postures any longer, I started to also listen and follow the entire yoga lifestyle teachings that connect body, mind, emotions and intellect. Its so powerful and beautiful to become more aware, more aligned and in tune. What brought you to Vienna? If you’re not from here <U+0001F609> LOVE originally brought me back to Vienna (hmmmm, that one did now work out so well…) and I guess my curiosity about how it would be move back to Austria again after all these years. I liked the idea of digging around my roots a bit more in detail. Also family brought me back of course and my vagabond heart that constantly asks for that genuine life experience. What projects are you working on? www.VENUSfrequency.com is my yoga lifestyle platform. I am combining my yoga and meditation classes with a radio show with the same name on RADIOorangewww.o94.at. Every 2nd and 4th Friday @ 7am ‘the yogic edition’ and every FIRST Sunday @ 11pm, ‘the pop|culture edition.’ I am building my brand on that platform, which includes my teachings and offerings, and am currently thinking of turning it into a VEREIN in order to receive financial support for my passion and quest to support mindfulness and help heal the world. Big dreams, I know. With my www.conferencedirect.com affiliation I help organizations, associations, event and seminar organizers to find the right hotel and meeting room locations for their events, assist in negotiating the contracts and add my 20+ years in the convention and meeting planning world to their wealth of expertise, all @ NO COST. If you know of anyone having a hard time with finding and deciding on the right hotel or struggling with hotel contracts for any of their events, have them contact me. This is my big girl job, but I would like to reverse the ranking here soon. What are you passionate about (besides yoga)? – the entire yoga lifestyle – hosting my radio show – traveling – people – conversations – wine, whiskey, food – everything outdoors – finding a way to get VENUSfrequency really off the ground (if you have any tips please let me know; I’m all ears!) -updating my Facebook and Instagram channels Where else can people find you when you’re not at Impact Hub? – riding a heavy city bike around town or my fast roadbike to Tulln and back – lying in the sun along the Danube somewhere – riding trains all over Austria (I’m trying to do the no car thing) – having a good glass of wine and a bite to eat with friends – snowboarding in the winter – looking for a choir to join somewhere to sing songs besides my “om-mmming and chanting mantras” Why should Impact Hub members do more yoga? It goes with everything that Impact Hubbers stand for! We are the ones that positively impact the world, and so does yoga. Its not just about the movement, there is so much more to it. I encourage everyone to come see, listen and be part of at least one class to get you started. I teach what I call a ‘pop|culture’ way of the yoga lifestyle. Is there is good music? Yes. Are there chanting and meditation and breathing exercises? Sometimes… but everything is brought to you in a very modern and understandable way. Trust me. Practicing yoga is so powerful and in the long run, it will make the world a better place. In one hour you get empowerment, tons of energy, some ancient wisdom, strength and the constant reminder to come back to YOUR present moment, your center… all with a cool community of Hubbers right there with you! YOGA, meditation, and mindfulness are not just trending because of the cool pants and music, they really do elevate all of our existence to be better. Its becoming part of our culture and it for sure doesn’t hurt! Thanks for the insights Annemarie and I’ll definitely be seeing you on Tuesdays at 8am!","August 10, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/header-600x400.jpg"
"67","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/16/impact-of-dressing-for-success/","ImpactHub","Impact of Dressing for Success","We all show up to work looking our fashionable best. And I might add, we all look pretty good doing it. However working in the same place, within similar same industries. This can sometimes make it challenging when we are selling a product to people outside of the Impact Hub Vienna bubble. We all know it and there is research to back it up – a first impression is made within seconds. Before either of you have a chance to exchange hello’s, someone has made a critical evaluation of you and placed you in a category – colleague, student, investment opportunity, etc. So how do you make the best first impression possible within those first few seconds? The answer is simple: your appearance. As I am not from Austria and do not know the norms with respect to dress codes, it is safe to say that my experience in this field is limited. So I sat down one afternoon for a coffee with Hanna Schatovitch, founder of Hanna in the House in 2016. Hanna offers style and career coaching. She believes that when it comes to dressing for success, your style is your business card. All I wanted to talk about last Thursday was style and Hanna helped me out. Investor, legal, and financial meetings can be pretty overwhelming. So we wanted to help you out with a bit of advice for when you are standing in front of your wardrobe and have no idea what to wear to that investor meeting. Spoiler alert: you don’t necessarily have to wear the suit that is in the back of your wardrobe in order to wow your audience. As Hanna likes to say there is a great style for every personality, every budget and type of individual. There is also a formal style for every personality, within every industry. Tip #1: Always be yourself Now this one may seem obvious, but the trick here is to be yourself, but a bit more dressed up. This could be as simple as changing a pair of shoes or throwing a blazer on top of your outfit. Feeling comfortable in your own skin is important, but so is feeling comfortable with a little bit of formality. Tip #2: Be Comfortable Hanna says that this means knowing what looks good on you and what feels good to you. This means knowing and understanding your proportions, body type, and the colours that look good on you. For Hanna this is of utmost importance because if you do not feel good in what you are wearing then you will not be confident and your audience with notice. You might not be comfortable in a formal black suit, so wear dress slacks (or a skirt) and a blazer in colours in which you feel comfortable and confident. Tip #3: Know your audience There are certain wardrobe expectations within every business environment, and the more traditional the sector, the more formal and traditional their unwritten dress code. This might mean that everyone shows up for work everyday in a suit and tie (the ladies are probably exempt from the tie requirement). If you have a meeting with a person from a traditional business sector, like banking, insurance, law, or finance, the way in which they and their colleagues dress will influence their expectations for your appearance. This means that you might have to dress a little more formally than you do everyday. The main takeaway is to feel confident in your clothes. Confidence is sexy and the likely hood of you scoring that job/investor/project pitch will go up significantly if your confidence shines. Ditch the dusty black suit from the back of your wardrobe and wear something that suits your personality and needs best. Sometimes all it takes are small and simple changes to impress at your next big meeting or event. For more information on dressing for success, style coaching, or career coaching go to Hanna’s website http://www.hannainthehouse.com/en/ or to contact her for a consultation.","August 16, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Blog-Image-Guide-2-1-600x400.jpg"

Last week we introduced one of our resident yogis, Annemarie and this week we are catching up with Elena. You can catch both of them at our weekly Tuesday yoga classes at 8am. Born in Russia and raised in Germany, Elena moved to Vienna in 2012 to pursue her degree in East Asian Economy and Society. She actually started her journey with Impact Hub at the Tokyo co-working space, where she did an internship before moving to Vienna to study. What sparked your interest in yoga? I wanted to connect with my body – to feel it and sense all the little things, which go on inside of me. Practicing yoga and becoming an instructor are very different. Why did you decide to teach? First of all I love to work with people on different levels and yoga is about mental and physical health. As a yoga teacher you work on both levels. Secondly, I enjoy teaching. It is simply an another approach to connect with people. Finally, I believe that we always have a little teacher and student within ourselves. I learn from my students and they learn from me in return. What projects are you working on? I am currently writing my master’s thesis and I teach yoga. Life can be also as simple as that! Who would have thought? What are you passionate about (besides yoga)? I love traveling and cannot wait to pack my bags after graduation and visit parts of the world I have never been to. Music and dance are my other passions in life. But you can’t enjoy life without great friends and loving people around you, and I am quite lucky to have wonderful people in my life. Where else can people find you when you’re not at Impact Hub? You can find me at Doktor Yoga in the 1st district. I also teach private classes at clients’ homes. What are some of your favorite songs/playlists/artists to listen to when you practice yoga? This is a really tough question. There are so many different artists on my playlists and there are so many different playlists! One of my current playlists includes Eefje de Visser, RY X, Bahamas, and Ólafur Arnalds. Why should Impact Hub members do more yoga? Everybody should listen to themselves and their body. If you do feel like yoga can benefit you, then you should do it. If you think it is not for you, then I’d say give it a try at least once. Many people say they are not flexible enough, but that is like staying that you are too dirty to take a bath. Each time I have left a yoga class, I always felt better than before the class. Thanks for the introduction Elena and I’ll be seeing you on Tuesdays at 8am at the Hub!","August 18, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/header-2-600x400.jpg"
"69","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/08/23/making-austria-home/","ImpactHub","Making Austria Home","We remember watching the news and reading the newspapers last summer as the number of refugees attempting to enter the E.U. surged. Westbahnhof became a temporary campground, as we attempted to make the newcomers feel welcome and safe. However, the process of integration is not as straightforward as processing paperwork. It takes time, patience and a fair amount of courage. The courage to start over, learn a new language, and accept a new way of life in a different place. We often find ourselves asking where we fit into this complex mosaic of political tensions and disrupted dreams. Where can our skills be put to use and what projects can we join to help create a positive impact? Partnering with various organizations, Impact Hub Vienna is committed to addressing this issue. Matthias Reisigner, co-founder of Impact Hub Vienna believes that, “creating new prospects for the future is essential for the successful integration of refugees. Thus, enabling integration into the Austrian labor market is of special importance. Only by having jobs, people are able to secure a livelihood for themselves and become integrated and productive parts of society.” Our newest program, found! is one such example. A collaboration between Deloitte Future Fund and Impact Hub Vienna, found! supports innovative and sustainable initiatives that create employment opportunities for refugees. Supported by an intensive, six month long incubation process, our aim with found! is to successfully establish the supported ideas, helping make them sustainable and scalable projects. And it is not too late to join! Applications from individuals, teams or existing initiatives/start-ups are welcome until September 4th at 6:00pm. The six best ideas will be selected from the pool of applicants to start the six month incubation program. The initiatives receive support to grow their idea from a concept all the way to a final pitch. Successful applicants will receive business coaching, individual consulting, access to the Impact Hub Vienna co-working space, mentoring, access to workshops, and access to the Deloitte and Impact Hub international networks. Deadline for Applications: September 4, 2016 – 6:00 PM Ideegration is another such incubator, addressing the integration process for refugees. Coming together on November 10th, Ideegration is currently searching for 15 top initiatives to participate in their incubation program. The participants will receive support from experts in management , consulting, business, politics, PR and marketing. Furthermore, five of the 15 will receive start up funding and work together even more closely with a team of experts to see their projects to completion. They are also calling on individuals to help support the good work that is already being done to address this issue. Whether you are a graphic designer or a consultant, they are looking for your help to help promote existing initiatives. Deadline for Applications: October 9th, 2016 If you are feeling inspired and want to join in, check out found! or Ideegration and stay tuned for the selected initiatives!

Micha hat Philosophie und Rechtswissenschaften in Graz mit Auslandsaufenthalten in Israel und Mexiko studiert. Er sieht sich als Optimist, reist gerne und ist einer dieser Gutmenschen. Mit seinem Bruder will er die biologische Landwirtschaft fördern; deshalb nahgenuss. Ziel ist es zu zeigen, dass auch kleinstrukturierte Landwirtschaft eine Zukunft hat, besonders wenn es um die Produktion von Fleisch geht. Fleisch soll als das wahrgenommen werden was es ist: Ein besonderes Genussprodukt. Was treibt Dich an? Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass die Welt in der wir heute leben, die beste Welt ist, die es je gab. Und dies, trotz der Kriege, der großen Armut vieler Gegenden und der großen Zerstörung der Umwelt; Dinge die es leider alle nach wie vor gibt. Was mich an der Welt an sich fasziniert, ist zu sehen, wie wir Menschen unser Zusammenleben ordnen; wie wir uns all diesen Problemen stellen. Es gibt nur noch wenige Wüsten, Urwälder oder Gebirgszüge die nicht von uns Menschen besiedelt sind. Mit so vielen Bewohnern bedarf es einer immer besseren Ordnung unseres Zusammenlebens. Gleichzeitig bringen neue Technologien neue Herausforderungen, die nicht nur neue Gesetzte fordern, sondern auch unser Zusammenleben ändern und andere soziale Normen hervorbringen. Die Auseinandersetzung von verschiedensten Weltanschauungen über unsere Zukunft: Wohin soll sich unsere Gesellschaft entwickeln? Was sind unsere Stärken? Was müssen wir noch besser machen? Fragen die sich jeder stellen kann. Ich weiß natürlich, dass dies jetzt die großen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft sind, die aber in dieser Größe auch unser tägliches Leben im Kleinen berühren. Was unsere Zeit einzigartig und deshalb auch so interessant macht, sind die Möglichkeiten eines einzelnen Menschen darauf Einfluss zu nehmen. Jeder kann sich darüber Gedanken machen was er sich von der Zukunft erwartet und seine Ideen auch sehr leicht verbreiten. Die Möglichkeit unsere Welt, wenn auch nur im Kleinen, ein Stück weit zu verbessern, treibt mich an. Welche Bedeutung hat gesunde Ernährung für Dich? Zwei Aspekte sind für mich hier ausschlaggebend: Wer sich gesund ernährt bleibt länger gesund. Wichtig ist mir, dass eine gesunde Ernährung nicht eine Frage des Einkommens sein darf. Jedes Kind, jeder Erwachsene sollte die Möglichkeit haben sich so zu ernähren, um möglichst lange gesund zu bleiben. Was mit Sorgfalt produziert wird, ist nicht nur gesund und schmeckt gut, sondern trägt auch dazu bei unseren Planeten und unsere Lebensgrundlage für die nächste Generationen zu schützen und zu bewahren. Wann hast Du die biologische Landwirtschaft für Dich entdeckt? Das Thema hat mich natürlich schon länger beschäftigt, und ich kenne schon seit meiner Kindheit einige Bio-Bauern sehr gut. So richtig beschäftigt mich das Thema aber erst seit einem Jahr (unserem Projektstart). Interessant ist es, mit den Bio-Landwirten zu reden und zu erfahren, welchen steinigen Weg viele gehen mussten. Viele wurden vor 20 Jahren noch belächelt; heute ist Bio-Landwirtschaft ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der österreichischen Produktion von Lebensmitteln. Worin siehst Du die Vorteile in der Direktvermarktung von biologischem Schweinefleisch? Desto kürzer der Weg vom Produzenten zum Konsumenten, desto besser für beide Seiten: Höhere Einkünfte bei den Landwirten und eine günstigere Möglichkeit für Konsumentinnen hochwertiges Bio-Fleisch zu kaufen. Die andere Seite ist die, dass KonsumentInnen wieder einen ehrlicheren Bezug zur Landwirtschaft und dem Produkt Fleisch bekommen. Mit eigenen Augen zu sehen, woher das Produkt kommt, zu sehen wer dahinter steht, verändert etwas beim Genuss von Fleisch. Man geht mit dem Produkt bewusster und sorgfältiger um. Bei Eurem Konzept spielt der Konsument eine wichtige Rolle. Warum ist es Dir so wichtig Konsumenten zum Teil von „nahgenuss“ zu machen? Fleisch war nicht immer ein „tägliches“ Essen. Es war etwas Besonderes, das es vielleicht sonntags oder an Feiertagen gab. Wir wollen dass unsere KonsumentInnen Fleisch als das wieder wahrnehmen was es ist: Ein besonderes Genussprodukt. Das soll uns durch den direkten Bezug zu den Bio-Bauern und Bio-Bäuerinnen gelingen. Gleichzeitig ist es unser Ziel, dass wieder alle Teile eines Schweines verwertet werden. Wenn ein Tier sterben muss, dann soll auch alles verwertet werden. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser für die „nahgenuss“ gegeben? Gespräche mit meinem Bruder und in meiner Familie über ein derartiges Projekt hat es schon länger gegeben. Das waren dann aber eher Ideenspielereien. Das Projekt nahgenuss dann wirklich zu starten ist eher dem Zufall geschuldet. Wo siehst Du dich mit „nahgenuss“ in einem Jahr? Als einen kleinen aber feinen Bestandteil der österreichischen Landwirtschaft. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Wir haben ein Produkt am Markt, dass es so in dieser Form noch nicht gibt. Am schwierigsten ist es, sowohl genügend Landwirte als auch KonsumentInnen davon zu überzeugen, dass unser Weg Schweinefleisch zu verkaufen bzw. zu kaufen der Bessere ist. Dass es die Handelskonzerne in ihrer heutigen Form so gibt, hat schon einen guten Grund. Es ist ein unglaublicher Komfort zum Supermarkt um die Ecke zu gehen und Produkte aus aller Welt kaufen zu können. Dahinter steht ein riesiger Logistikapparat, den wir so in dieser Form nie werden bieten können. Uns wird es nur gelingen erfolgreich zu sein, wenn wir es schaffen, KonsumentInnen zu überzeugen, dass bei Fleisch unser Weg der Bessere für Mensch, Tier und Umwelt ist; gleichzeitig müssen wir neue Strukturen (z.B. den Postversand von Fleisch) gut nützen. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich frage und lese viel. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? Als studierter Philosoph könnte ich hier sicherlich mehr sagen, aber ich kürze das Ganze ab: Keine Termine und ein Glas Bier. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Obwohl mein Bruder und ich nicht unterschiedlicher sein könnten, was uns verbindet ist unser Drang zumindest eine Kleinigkeit für eine bessere Welt beizutragen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf einen klassischen Karriereweg.. Ich habe Jus und Philosophie studiert und könnte jetzt auch einen recht gut bezahlten Job haben. Diesen Weg habe ich zumindest noch nicht eingeschlagen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Abwechslung und die Menschen die man trifft. Auch wenn unsere Firma winzig ist, bin ich der Chef der Firma und als Chef trifft man bei Terminen mit anderen Firmen dort auch meistens den Chef. Diese Möglichkeit haben nur Wenige in meinem Alter. Gleichzeitig bin ich oft bei Landwirten zu Besuch. Dort erfährt man immer eine unglaubliche Gastfreundschaft. Da kann es schon vorkommen, dass man statt geplant einer Stunde den ganzen Nachmittag am Bauernhof verbringt und auch noch zum Abendessen bleibt. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Mein Freundeskreis und meine Familie. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir haben noch keine großen Pläne, sondern versuchen uns Tag für Tag, Woche für Woche voranzuarbeiten. Mal sehen wohin die Reise geht. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Durch meinen Tatendrang. Ich bin ein schlechter Verkäufer. Was ich dafür gut kann, ist Ideen in die Tat umzusetzen. Wenn Leute sehen, auf mich ist Verlass, ich setzte etwas um; das motiviert. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familie zu diesem Engagement? Gerade am Anfang wurde ich schon hin und wieder belächelt. Das Verständnis für so eine Idee bekommt man erst mit der Zeit. Der Großteil meiner Freunde findet es aber toll, dass mein Bruder und ich uns trauen, das Projekt nahgenuss umzusetzen. Mittlerweile sind auch schon erste Erfolge zu sehen, was das Ganze leichter macht. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Ein Buch, dass man unbedingt lesen sollten: Und zwar die Biographie von Teddy Roosevelt „The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt“ von Edmund Morris. Es ist nicht nur eine unglaublich spannende Lebensgeschichte, sondern zeigt auch sehr gut, wie sich die Welt in 100 Jahren verändert hat. Ein Beispiel: Heute wäre es undenkbar, dass ein US-Präsident nicht erreichbar ist. Teddy Roosevelt war oft Wochen alleine in der Wildnis der USA, ohne dass jemand gewusst hätte, wo er genau ist.

Although we have been enjoying our summer here at Impact Hub Vienna, we have not been slacking off too much. And our hard work paid off because in this latest installment from the Success Board, we have some pretty rockin’ successes to celebrate. At the last Wine Down held at the Badeschiff, Community Catalyst Dushan announced the most recent successes at the Hub. To cheers and applause we celebrated four categories of success here at the Hub. Under the category “Next Step” Success we celebrated Organisation Dock12, who just launched Kontexten.org. Günter Strobl and Dock12 are helping businesses better understand the complex context within which they exist, thereby helping them generating a holistic business model. To give you a little context, here is their new website: http://www.kontexten.org/. We also celebrated cooking initiative “Koch Doch” which has officially become an association! They will continue to offer delicious, nutritious home cooked meals for the Impact Hub Vienna community. In case you haven’t checked it out before, be sure to swing by and check in with Barbara Schöllenberger on Thursday’s upstairs where she prepares vegan meals every week. We also celebrated BLITAB, this years Social Impact Award winner. They recently launched the beta version of their tablet for blind and visually impaired people. BLITAB Technology, developed the first-ever tactile tablet, which uses a new liquid-based technology to create a tactile tablet experience similar to Braille. The tablet can also produce tactile graphics and maps for the blind and vision impaired. Under the “Getting Acknowledged” category, we celebrated Shades Tour, which made the “Top 40 Things to Do in Austria This Summer” list. Their tours were mentioned among the first five activities. In case you didn’t know they are now offering tours in English, so be sure to check it out. Under the “Founding Something Great” category we celebrated Weitsicht, who recently opened the Sustainable Management Centre in Vienna. They are providing assistance to small and medium sized companies that want to create businesses in a sustainable and socially responsible way. Finally for the “Personal Victory” category we celebrated Annemarie Harant, co-founder of Erdbeerwoche as she was invited to be a speaker for Start-Up Retreat Portugal. Start-Up Retreat is a special project for open-minded entrepreneurs to get together in inspiring places to brainstorm and network. We also celebrated author Maja Monrue on the publication of her first book called “A Book For Men” and on her recent engagement! We want to keep you inspired so be sure to add your successes to our Success Board on the first floor of the Hub and we will feature you in September’s Town Hall/Summer Party Event which is taking place on September 22nd.

Creating inclusive and affordable education initiatives to help children and families grow within healthy communities is the focus of some ventures in Impact Hub Vienna. The development of new skills to help our children thrive in the future business landscape is essential. As a society, new educational approaches and initiatives are needed and several Impact Hub Vienna Members are creating new methods and means of educating children from within the current formal system and expanding the reach of education beyond the classroom. Talentify is creating better educational opportunities for students within the current school system. For Talentify, education is partially inherited through parental education levels and income level. This has a twofold effect on education of children from lower income families, it often means that they cannot access help at home and that private tutoring to advance in subject areas is unaffordable. Talentify proposes a social exchange platform between peers that would allow students to teach each other and gain valuable job related skills in the process. This removes the financial burden from students and their families as well as creates a valuable platform for all students to skill share. Schule im Aufbruch wants to create a better classroom for children to develop their full potential as creative thinkers and problem-solvers. The purpose of their venture is to create inspiring classroom environments that are more responsive to the individual needs of children. They work with community and school leaders to change the way education is perceived and the classroom environment functions. Schule im Aufbruch has created an exchange platform with educational experts to help teachers move students towards a sense of personal responsibility for their education as opposed to a duty to fulfill their educational requirements. In an increasingly complex and global financial environment navigating one’s personal finances is becoming more difficult to understand. Three Coins fills that knowledge gap by providing easily accessible and understanding financial literacy tools. Their flagship product, CURE Runners, is the award winning smartphone app that teaches young and old alike about financial literacy; education through gamificiation. Three Coins is launching a new smartphone app that allows an individual to learn about their financial behaviour without numbers; with graphic displays and an intuitive format anyone can learn about their own budget and financial literacy. Neuwal is working on education in politics. With the upcoming elections for Bundespräsident in Austria, every vote is critical. To address this issue, Dieter Zirnig organized the Langer Tag der Politik, an Austrian-wide event that helped bring students and first time voters up to speed on everything regarding the election. It was hugely successful, reaching over 5.000 students across the entire country. In lieu of the revote taking place on October 2nd, Neuwal has organized PopUp Politik, a workshop tailored to educate voters on the candidates and issues that are important for the revote this fall.","September 7, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/books-education-school-literature-48126-600x400.jpg"
"73","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/09/16/european-forum-alpbach/","ImpactHub","European Forum Alpbach","What started as a gathering of students in 1945 has become one of the must-attend events on Austria’s calendar. The European Forum Alpbach gathers together industry thought leaders from the arenas of science, politics, business and culture every year for 3 weeks of conversations that shape Austria’s future. In fact, this year there were 939 speakers and more than 3,600 visitors from 90 different countries! Impact Hub Vienna has been involved with the forum for the past 7 years, but it was only this year that we were able to break through the glass ceiling. This year Impact Hub Vienna was included in the closing plenary of the political symposium, cementing its role as a key player in the forum and bringing in other Impact Hubs across Europe. Not only are we changing the format of this conversation, we are sitting front and center. “We are looking back at a long and fruitful partnership with the European Forum Alpbach and it is fantastic to see that we have been able to extend this partnership to the European Impact Hub network. A rapidly growing number of institutions and decision makers are realising the need to combine a top-down policy making approach with the energy of the growing bottom-up grassroots movement, which the Impact Hub network is representing, in order to maximise impact. The European Forum Alpbach is the perfect platform for these forces to merge and we are honoured to have been invited to sit at the table.” Matthias Reisinger, Co-found & Director, Impact Hub Vienna Because of the relationship developed by Impact Hub Vienna, this year, 14 Impact Hubs from across Europe were represented at the forum. Gabriela Gandal, Managing Director of Impact Hub was asked to chair the plenary on sustainable development, which was comprised of ventures from Impact Hubs across Europe. The mere existence of this plenary is proof that the work of the Impact Hub network is being seen as integral to the future of Vienna. During this plenary, Simon Schmitz, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Office of clean energy provider aWATTar this year was a speaker and spoke with passion about his work, a cleaner future and the role of social entrepreneurs in creating change. This couldn’t be truer for Impact Hubs, where social entrepreneurs gather every day to take action on things that matter most. Other entrepreneurs from the Impact Hub network that spoke during the plenary included: Baptiste Carriere-Pradal, VICE PRESIDENT EUROPE, SUSTAINABLE APPAREL COALITION, AMSTERDAM Mona Mijthab, FOUNDER & DESIGNER, MOSAN MOBILE SANITATION, ZURICH Paula Peters, GLOBAL DIRECTOR LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT, CHANGE.ORG, BERLIN Jeffrey D. Sachs, DIRECTOR, THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK Clare Sutcliffe, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CODE CLUB; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITIES & OUTREACH, RASPBERRY PI FOUNDATION, LONDON With so many Impact Hubs in the same location, this gathering could be viewed as a test case for an annual internal European Impact Hub event, allowing all Hub’s to have their voice as part of the conversation. “In the past years, the global Impact Hub movement really helped put social entrepreneurship on the map. Don’t underestimate its power in creating communities of peer-to-peer learning, inspiration and co-creation. The coming years will show if it can also help advocate for a radical transformation of our economic system. Does the Hub network have concepts at hand what a post-carbon society should look like? Opportunities for ‘utopian’ ideas to gain traction might not be so far away, so it better be prepared for the next challenge.” Philippe Narval, Managing Director/European Forum Alpbach So what is the next phase of the conversation?

Mehrjährige Berufserfahrung beim Klima- und Energiefonds, beim EU-Umweltbüro des Umweltdachverbandes sowie als Universitätsassistent an der Universität für Bodenkultur haben ihn auf die Gründung von Collective Energy vorbereitet. Julian möchte mit Collective Energy mehr Menschen und Unternehmen die Möglichkeit geben die Energiezukunft aktiv mitzugestalten. Bereits im Kindesalter war Christoph Zinganell von Sonnennergie fasziniert und wuchs in seinem familiären Umfeld mit effizientem Denken und Handeln im Mostviertel auf. Nach dem Bachelor-Studium der Elektrotechnik (TU Wien) besuchte er die Universität für Bodenkultur, wo er den Master Energiemanagement und Umweltpolitik mit Auszeichnung abschloss. Dort wurde auch die Idee von Collective Energy geboren. Nach einer 7-monatigen Reise durch Zentral- und Südamerika im Jahr 2014 traf er gemeinsam mit Julian Wudy die Entscheidung Collective Energy von einer studentischen Initiative in ein professionelles Unternehmen überzuführen. Christoph sieht in Collective Energy eine Chance gemeinsam die Energiewende voran zu treiben. Julian und Christoph sind seit der Gründung im November 2015 geschäftsführende Gesellschafter der Collective Energy GmbH. Collective Energy ist ein junges Unternehmen das Energie gemeinschaftlich denkt. Durch eine Neuinterpretation des Crowdfundingkonzeptes im Zusammenhang mit Gutscheinen als Rückzahlungsinstrument werden Unternehmen und Vereine in die Lage versetzt gemeinsam mit den eigenen Kunden kostengünstiger auf Solarenergie umzusteigen und zusätzlich von Kundenbindungseffekten zu profitieren. Jeder Einzelne kann so über kleine Beträge Unternehmen unterstützen auf Solarenergie umzusteigen und von Preisvorteilen für Produkte und Dienstleistungen des täglichen Bedarfs profitieren. Was treibt Euch an? Der aktuelle Stillstand und der Wille etwas zu verändern. Das für unsere Zukunft immens wichtige Thema Energie aus dem Schattendasein zu holen und die Menschen für dieses Thema zu sensibilisieren. Wann habt Ihr die Photovoltaik für Euch entdeckt? Weil sie sich mit einem unserer Grundgedanken gut verbinden lässt: Energie soll dort produziert werden wo sie auch verbraucht wird. Und Sonnenenergie ist nicht nur reichlich vorhanden sie lässt sich mit modernen Speichersystemen auch überall und zu jeder Zeit nutzen. Wie habt Ihr diese „demokratische“ Finanzierung für Photovoltaik Anlagen entwickelt? Was ist daran so besonders? Uns ging es darum einen Weg zu finden mehr Menschen für den Umweltschutz und erneuerbare Energien zu begeistern und in weiterer Folge in den Prozess der Energiewende zu integrieren. Das Besondere ist, dass wir eine Möglichkeit geschaffen haben, welche allen Menschen wie Dir & Mir die Möglichkeit gibt den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien zu finanzieren indem sie Produkte und Dienstleistungen des täglichen Bedarfs kaufen. Durch eine Vielzahl an kleinen Geldbeträgen, werden größere Projekte realisierbar und Menschen unterstützen damit Betriebe direkt auf Solarenergie umzusteigen. Sie kaufen z.B. Wein und der Winzer verpflichtet sich mit den erzielten Erlösen eine Solaranlage zu bauen. So entsteht eine Win-Win-Win-Situation von der neben dem Unternehmer und dem Kunden auch die Umwelt profitiert. Der Unternehmer profitiert von einem kostengünstigeren Umstieg auf Solarenergie und langfristigen Kundenbindungseffekten, die Unterstützer von attraktiven Einkaufsvorteilen und die Umwelt von reduzierten CO2-Emissionen. Hat es einen bestimmten Auslöser für dieses Projekt gegeben? Es gab mehrere Momente die uns bestärkt haben Collective Energy zu gründen. Der wichtigste war wohl, dass wir rasch unser erstes Pilotprojekt umgesetzt haben und dadurch den Glauben an die eigene Idee gefestigt haben und auf viel positive Resonanz von außen gestoßen sind. Wie habt Ihr euch gefunden? Durch eine gemeinsame Lehrveranstaltung an der Universität für Bodenkultur. Es ging darum an einem fiktiven Businessplan zu erarbeiten, wir haben uns rasch entschieden das wir hier nicht nur in der Theorie agieren wollen, sondern zum Handeln übergehen wollen. Was gefällt Euch am Unternehmertum? Genau der oben angesprochene Punkt. Wir bekommen durch Collective Energy die Möglichkeit unsere eigenen Ideen umzusetzen und müssen nicht tatenlos zusehen wie andere in die falsche Richtung steuern. Wir wollen unsern Beitrag leisten indem wir aktiv agieren. Collective Energy gibt uns die Möglichkeit die Zukunft aktiv mitzugestalten. Das begeistert uns! Wen es einmal Knatsch gibt, wie geht Ihr damit um? Wir versuchen daraus zu lernen. Wir sind zum Glück zwei sehr unterschiedliche Persönlichkeiten und haben unterschiedliche Stärken und Schwächen, welche wir dazu nutzen unsere gemeinsame Idee weiterzubringen. Das wichtigste in diesem Zusammenhang ist jedoch nicht nachtragend zu sein, die Dinge offen anzusprechen sowie die Meinung des anderen zu respektieren und so auf einen gemeinsamen Nenner zu kommen. Wo seht ihr euch mit „Collective Energy“ in einem Jahr? Collective Energy ist gewachsen, hat mehre Projekte umgesetzt und die ersten Mitarbeiter eingestellt. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Weil es keine Alternative dazu gibt. In den etablierten Strukturen fehlt sehr oft der Sinn für Neues bzw. ist das System in Sich zu träge und innovationsfaul. Wir wollen nicht auf Morgen warten, sondern heute Handeln. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Die Energie zweier junger, engagierter Unternehmer die versuchen mit neuen Ideen und Herangehensweisen die Welt etwas besser zu machen. Worauf verzichtet Ihr, um Eure Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf Freizeit, Geld und ausgiebiges Reisen (- was uns wohl am meisten von den drei Dingen schmerzt). Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Auf persönlicher Ebene: die Möglichkeit eigene Ideen zu verfolgen und alles dafür tun zu können diese zur Umsetzung zu bringen. Und natürlich Erfolge zu erleben und zu wissen, dass man selbst dafür verantwortlich ist. Auf gesellschaftlicher Ebene: rund um Collective Energy hat sich ein positives Netzwerk gebildet, dass uns nicht nur darin bestärkt unsere eigenen Ideen voranzubringen, sondern uns auch immer wieder vor Augen führt, dass unser Agieren auch auf gesellschaftlicher Ebene von Relevanz ist. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Es ist schwierig hier einzelne Personen hervorzuheben. Collective Energy ist von so vielen Personen umgeben die die Idee mittragen und weiter voranbringen. Sehr viele Menschen haben mit kleinen und großen Taten dazu beigetragen, dass Collective Energy jetzt dort steht wo es steht und dieser Umstand erfüllt uns einfach mit Dankbarkeit und spornt uns gleichzeitig noch mehr an Collective Energy und unsere Ideen voranzubringen. Den nur gemeinsam kann man Großes bewegen. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Wir sind beide Familienmenschen und sind hier nicht nur von Menschen umgeben mit denen wir die schönen Momente teilen, sondern finden hier auch Unterschlupf und Halt, wenn es nicht passt. Die wichtigsten Bezugspersonen sind aber ohne Zweifel unsere besseren Hälften. Sie erleben alle Up and Downs hautnah mit und sind wichtige Ansprechpartner für alle Lebenslagen, sozusagen unsere Unternehmens-, Lebens- und Strategieberater im Hintergrund. Aber das wichtigste sie “zwingen” uns dazu das Leben außerhalb Collective Energys zu genießen und geben uns so die Kraft für unser unternehmerisches Handeln. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir sprudeln an Ideen wie wir die Welt gemeinsam verbessern und haben definitiv noch ein paar Überraschungen im Petto. Aber in erster Linie hoffen wir, dass uns die Arbeit mit Collective Energy nicht auf eine einsame Insel bringt, denn wir wollen mit Collective Energy das Zündfeuer für einen kollektiven Kraftakt zur Energiewende legen. Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Die Bandbreite ist vielfältig. Von “ich bin sooo unglaublich stolz auf dich und ihr müsst dass unbedingt weitermachen” bis zu “suche dir doch lieber einen sicheren Job und denk an deine Zukunft” ist alles dabei. Habt Ihr Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Gründet kein Unternehmen;-) Aber Spaß beiseite: Der wohl wichtigste Tipp ist an seine eigenen Ideen und Fähigkeiten zu glauben. Man ertappt sich viel zu oft dabei die Schuld bei anderen zu suchen, es ist befreiend die Dinge selbst in die Hand zu nehmen und zu agieren. Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Wenn man aktuell einen Blick auf die Welt wirft tauchen viele Wünsche auf. Unser größtes Anliegen ist es die zwischenmenschliche Interaktion wieder zu verstärken, denn so werden oft Probleme bereits im Keim erstickt und tolle Lösungen entwickelt. Sei es beim Klimaschutz oder in sozialen Fragen, nur gemeinsam können hier entsprechende Lösungen gefunden und die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit bewältigt werden. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Mit offenen Augen durch´s Leben gehen und den größten Medien nicht alles glauben, sondern den Dingen selbst auf den Grund gehen und diese kritisch zu hinterfragen. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Alfred Strigl ….gibt es sonst noch Geschichten, Erfahrungen die Ihr uns erzählen wollt?!? Unser aktuelles Projekt: Aus Sonnenschein wird bester Wein Bis Ende September kann man das naturverbundene Weingut Walek aus Poysdorf durch den Kauf von Sonnenstrom-Gutscheinpaketen dabei unterstützen eine 30 kWp Photovoltaik-Anlage zu installieren. Für 250 € bekommt man attraktive Weinpakete oder Gutscheine im Wert von 300 € plus Gratisversand. Die Weine werden die nächsten 5 Jahre frei Haus geliefert und stellen das ideale Geschenk für alle Weinliebhaber dar. Denn man sichert sich ausgezeichneten Weine zu vergünstigen Preisen und unterstützen gleichzeitig einen sympathischen Familienbetrieb auf Sonnenenergie umzusteigen!

The Impact of Collective Collaboration"," When you think of computer hackers, you generally picture the 1995 movie Hackers or Penelope Garcia from the show Criminal Minds, people sitting alone in a room filled with computers. However, as I learned at the Impact Hub Vienna Hackathon at Ars Electronica in Linz, nothing could be further from the truth. The Lemmings came to Ars Electronica en masse to show us all what teamwork means. The Lemmings are a group of hackers founded by Thomas Schranz. He started the group in order to get people interested in computer programming and to create new and innovative solutions. While I was at the Ars Electronica Festival, they turned up to show us what they could do. The way that Lemmings usually work is that they meet up at a predetermined location, like a coffee shop, where the theme of the day, subject matter, and actual location are revealed. The group then works as a team to create an innovative chat program based solution, known as a chat bot. Impact Hub Vienna has hosted the Lemmings on several occasions, and they are named after the computer game – in case you were wondering. This was just the latest instance of collaboration between the hacker group and Impact Hub Vienna. I spoke to several individuals about their favorite projects and chat bots. I received a thorough tour of the most famous chat bot, Poncho (unfortunately, this was not created by the Lemmings). Poncho can tell you about the weather and uses natural language processing algorithms to understand what you are saying and respond appropriately. In this case, Gerald Urschitz and I asked Poncho if we needed a jacket to go outside in Linz that day. Poncho responded with “No.” That was likely related to the fact that it was an absolutely gorgeous, sunny day outside. Dominik Felix showed me a chat bot that he was working on. It turns out that it might be possible to ask for help concerning your cable television over Facebook Messenger, and even order your cable products and set up an appointment in your home. He then showed me an innovative business card with a cross between a QR code and a Snapchat function that allows you to start a conversation with someone by scanning his or her business card. I spoke with Kira Zatsepina and learned that she helped create a chat bot that returned movies quotes and pictures based on whatever mood you typed into the question field. For example, if you typed silence into the chat bot it would return one of the many scenes from Pulp Fiction where they stared at each other in complete and utter silence. The bot that Artemis Linhart is most proud of helping to create, is an innovative and fun way to track your package through the post. You type your tracking number into the chat bot and it returns the travel diary of your package along with a picture of your package which has been anthropomorphized and super imposed onto another image. However, as I spoke to the Lemmings about their various projects, people kept directing me to Carina Pfann and her raspberry pi. That is not a typo, by the way. As Carina explained to me, a raspberry pi is a very small and simple Linux computer. Hers was set up in a very colorful case with an LED display. The purpose of this little computer was to display the mood of a conference or event with a simple color based on the various moods and adjectives that participants typed into the chat bot Getso. When you type in a mood, a color comes back on your phone, but also through the LED display. This would change based on the overall mood of the participants. The chat bot does this through what is known as sentiment analysis and is based on a training set from social media. Next time you see a group of Lemmings follow them and see what cool things they might be up to, the computer hackers not the animals!","September 28, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/header-1-1-600x400.jpg"

Impact Hub is all about growing a locally rooted and globally connected community. Also, we try to create as much positive impact as humanly possible. Ready. Set. Go. But have you ever asked yourself – how we do that exactly? I mean, how do you come up with measurable impact data? You might sense it when you work in Lindengasse 56, hear about an unexpected connection made at the Hub or join one of the community events like the Sexy Salad. But what are the hard cold facts and measurable impact we create as a community? On Thursday 22nd of September we hosted our 2nd TownHall meeting where we brought you up to speed on the developments at the Hub and presented our first ever Impact Report (printed version can be found at reception an online version is coming soon). “But what is the Impact Report?” Well, I’m glad you asked! It’s a 73 page booklet full of facts and figures, supported impact ventures and hosted Programs and Events. And here are some numbers to underline how cool the Impact Report is: In 2015 27,432 hours of support were given from members to members There were over 250 events hosted last year and we are projecting over 450 events for 2016. Also there were 503 new jobs created and 6.6 million clients were reached! If you want to be smacked with more inspirational numbers and pretty Impact Hub pictures, feel free to grab an Impact Report yourself. The Hosts have them at the Welcome Desk and its definitely worth picking one up. The Town Hall was not only about reflecting on our impact from last year, we also asked for YOUR needs and visions. So, three interactive feedback groups were formed, focusing on Strategy2020, Space and Community. Guests joined different groups and we received some well needed input from the community. In Alexis’ strategy brainstorming session, the community showed interest in participating in the development and implementation of our 2020 strategy. As a result, we are going to be hosting quarterly strategy sessions with the community, to keep the improvements coming. Our Space Curator Babsi held a brainstorming session for how we can improve our space. She also revealed some space changes happening in the future such as the Do-It-Yourself Space from Woodsaw which will be opened before the end of 2016. The third breakout session was held by Dushan, our Community Host. He posed the question on how we might inspire, connect, and enable our community? Some of the ideas were: An Open Books Event, one-on-one Coaching and an Impact Hub Marathon Group. If you want to poke around a bit more, you can find some of the other suggestions here and if you want to see these ideas become reality even faster, be sure to get in touch with Dushan at [email protected] If you want to continue the conversation on Space and Strategy, feel free to send your thoughts to: [email protected] and b[email protected] After the feedback sessions we went on to redefine Octoberfest and celebrate collaboration. We brought together classical Weißbier & Weißwurst with innovative Beer Cocktails and connecting games like the Collaboration Bingo. The team from Younited Cultures kicked off their Crowdfunding Campaign and hosted the Diversity Sock Party – where some hilarious pics were created. Be sure to check out the next WineDown on the 20th of October!

It is us and them; city dwellers versus country dwellers, right wing versus left wing, or creative versus corporate. While it seems to be completely natural to divide the world into us and them – this has become our pattern of living and thinking. At Impact Hub Vienna, we wanted to challenge this view of the world and so we created an event to unlearn our regular patterns of living and thinking. And by unlearn – we, of course, mean smashing it to bits by attending the Breaking Patterns Festival on October 25 – 26. Speakers and Guests of Honour The festival will be two days of speakers, workshops, networking events, and seminars. We will be exploring new ways experiencing the world. From Veronika Fiegl, a practitioner in the Grinberg method, who will help you channel your fear and anxiety into amazing drive to Tomáš Sedlácek, the author of The Economics of Good and Evil, where he shatters the paradigm that economics is not about mathematical interpretations of consumer and market behaviour, but in fact a more fundamental and visceral question of ethics. (My) Reality – the Virtual Reality Experience Vrei, the Virtual Reality Lounge down the street, will be hosting a virtual reality event. The VR experience is a paradigm shift in and of itself, with completely immersive sound and video. However, we wanted to show you what life is like in a refugee camp. So Impact Hub Vienna and Vrei have partnered to bring you (My) Reality, an experience like no other to show people the life and conditions that refugees experience in camps around the world. So come on an amazing journey with us and learn how to break your regular patterns. Change your routine for a few days (or longer!) and join us at Impact Hub Vienna for the Breaking Patterns Festival. Check out the website and purchase your tickets.

Congratulations Accelerate Team! This comes hot on the heels of a recent survey conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which ranked the best countries in the world for social entrepreneurship. Impressively, Austria ranked 11th out of 45 countries in terms of female social entrepreneurship. The aim of the survey was to assess the climate of entrepreneurship across the world to see which environments (including political and financial) are most supportive of businesses wishing to make a social impact. In each country surveyed, the Thomas Reuters Foundation contacted 20 experts across the area of social entrepreneurship for their responses. 47.5% of respondents were social entrepreneurs themselves, while the remainder included policymakers, investors, academics and ‘others’. 48% of respondents were women. The top 3 countries may not surprise you – the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, however others in the top 10 might. Israel was ranked 5th, scoring top points for ‘Public Understanding’ meaning that the general public understands what social entrepreneurs do. Chile was ranked 6th, partly due to good government policy that supports social entrepreneurs. In regards to the women’s poll, the top 3 countries are a mixed bag – The Philippines, Russia and Norway. This assessment was based on 2 aspects – the gender gap and representation in leadership roles (in social enterprises). The areas where Austria preformed slightly better than average included: Social entrepreneurship gaining momentum Social entrepreneur access to the non-financial support they need (e.g. financial, legal and technical advice; access to markets and networks; coaching, mentoring and training) These factors go a long way in showing that soon – maybe even next year – Austria will rank even better.

"79","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/10/29/ein-interview-mit-geri-kriechbaum/","ImpactHub","Ein Interview mit Geri Kriechbaum","“Ich finde es spannend mit Kleidung ein Statement, eine Einstellung transportieren zu können.” Geri Kriechbaum ist 26 Jahre alt und kommt aus dem Bezirk Vöcklabruck in Oberösterreich. Geri hat einen ganz „normalen“ Lebensweg durchgemacht – Volksschule, Hauptschule, HTL und dann eben der 9-5 Job, wie man es halt NORMAL so macht. Im Jahr 2014 hat er sich zum ersten Mal die Frage gestellt: Was ist eigentlich los ist, wenn ich diesen Job aus irgend einem Grund nicht mehr habe? Was würde ich machen? Er ist dann sehr rasch zu der Entscheidung gekommen aus seiner Leidenschaft zum Zeichnen, aber auch für´s Marketing ein kleines Business nebenbei zu starten. Geri hat seinen „sicheren” Job als Maschinenbau Konstrukteur gekündigt und sich für ein Studium für Kommunikations-wissenschaften eingetragen, um für sein Unternehmen dazulernen zu können und sich mehr auf seine Leidenschaft konzentrieren zu können. Stroncton ist eine Lifestylebrand für Menschen die genau das machen was sie lieben, die unserer Gesellschaft und Umwelt etwas zurückgeben und einen positiven Einfluss auf unsere Zukunft haben wollen. Diese Marke steht für faire und umweltbewusst hergestellte Produkte, sie unterstützt mit jedem Verkauf Charity-/ Tierschutz- oder Umweltschutzprojekte. Ein großes Ziel ist es dem Kunden ein gutes und schönes Gefühl mitzugeben. Was treibt Dich an? Was mich am meisten antreibt sind meine Träume und Ziele. Ich möchte eines Tages aufstehen und wissen, dass ich jetzt genau das machen kann was mir Spaß macht – sprich, ich will mein Hobby zum Beruf machen. Es ist dann nicht mehr das Gefühl von „arbeiten zu MÜSSEN“ sondern ich darf genau das machen, was meine Berufung ist. Mit meiner Arbeit möchte ich etwas gutes für unsere Zukunft bewirken: Ich möchte Hilfsorganisationen für Menschen, Tiere und Natur unterstützen. Und genau so möchte ich dann natürlich auch meinen Lebensunterhalt verdienen und mein eigener Chef sein. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Mode entdeckt? Leidenschaft für Mode ist vielleicht zu übertrieben ich würde eher Design als meine Leidenschaft bezeichnen. In meiner Skateboard-Zeit war ich schon immer von verschiedenen Marken wie Volcom, Emerica, Flip und aktuell Picture, Brixton, Famous usw. fasziniert. Sie alle bringen einen besonderen Lifestyle auf die Straße der mich begeistert. Mit viel Liebe zum Detail und „out of the box“ Designs verleihen sie deren Marke etwas besonderes. Ich wollte schon im Jahr 2005 ein Label gründen, jedoch war dann irgendwie Schule usw. wichtiger. <U+0001F609> ….und warum dann gleich fair und nachhaltig? Das hat sich daraus ergeben, dass ich immer öfter von echt schlimmen Vorfällen gehört habe die mir teilweise echt sorgen bereiten…sei es von Kinderarbeit, Arbeitszeiten die sich bei uns niemand vorstellen könnte oder Arbeitsbedingungen wo man bei uns den Laden sofort dicht machen würde. Warum sollen Menschen auf der anderen Seite der Erde unter schlechteren Bedingungen arbeiten müssen als bei uns?? Nur damit wir billigst irgendwelche Massenwaren kaufen können?!?!? Weiters hat mir die Backpack-Reise mit meiner Freundin durch Vietnam die Augen geöffnet. Wunderschöne Strände…doch überall Plastikmüll und Styroporverpackungen. Das war teilweise echt nicht schön anzusehen. Und deshalb war für mich von Anfang an klar, dass alle Produkte von Stroncton zu 100% fair und umweltbewusst hergestellt werden. Mit deinem Kleidungslabel orientierst du dich sehr stark an nachhaltigen und umweltbewussten Prinzipien und darüber geht es dir ja auch noch um den guten Zweck. Wie zeigt sich das konkret? Genau, also dieser Punkt ist uns besonders wichtig. Wir möchten somit einen Beitrag dazu leisten, das Gleichgewicht wieder herzustellen. Mit jedem verkauften Produkt wollen wir einen guten Zweck unterstützen. Mit unserer ersten Line (The Stroncton Human Line) arbeiten wir mit skate-aid zusammen . Hierbei werden 10% vom Verkaufspreis an skate-aid gespendet und somit können Skateparks gebaut und Skateboards für Kinder in armen Ländern zu verfügung gestellt werden. Wir haben noch viele coole Projekte auf unserer Ideen Liste, die werden jetzt eben nach und nach umgesetzt um möglichst viele coole gute Sachen zu unterstützen. Und genau so kommen wir zum nächsten Punkt bzw. zur nächsten Frage <U+0001F642> Was macht dein Modelabel so besonders? Bei uns gehts nicht darum so viel Kohle wie möglich zu machen – klar, das Ziel wäre irgendwann mal davon leben zu können. Aber dieser Prozess wird einfach dauern und wir wollen Stroncton nachhaltig und mit einem starken Fundament aufbauen. Daher hat sich auch unser Social-Media Hashtag abgeleitet: #heartoverbucks Soll soviel heißen, dass wir Mensch / Tier und Umwelt über den Profit stellen und darauf besonders achten. Es bedeutet aber auch, dass wir (zumindest jeden Tag ein wenig) das machen sollen was uns Spaß macht, was wir lieben und nicht immer gleich darauf schauen, ob dabei genug Geld rausschaut. Wir wollen unseren Kunden ein besonderes Gefühl mitgeben – er unterstützt ja mit jedem Kauf einen guten Zweck, und somit braucht man nicht einmal ein schlechtes Gewissen haben wenn man bei Stroncton einkauft, haha <U+0001F642> Weiters werden unsere Produkte mit viel Liebe zum Detail hergestellt, verpackt usw. Es kann auch sein, dass bei einem Päckchen von Stroncton auch die eine oder andere Überaschung zu finden ist <U+0001F642> Wir wollen dem Kunden einfach eine tolle Erfahrung bieten, denn unsere Produkte sind eben für die coolsten Menschen der Welt. Was macht Mode für dich so spannend? Ich find es einfach spannend mit T-Shirts, Hoodies usw. ein Statement, eine Einstellung transportieren zu können, und somit kann es jeder sehen. Mit dem Branding wird die Marke mit Werte und Zielen bestücken und über das Medium T-Shirt zum Beispiel werden diese hinaus getragen. Weiters find ich es einfach toll zu sehen, wenn Menschen ein glückliches Lächeln im Gesicht haben wenn sie zB. ein T-Shirt kaufen welches ihnen besonders gut gefällt. Ich finds einfach cool Menschen zum lächeln zu bringen. Kann Mode einen Beitrag für eine bessere Welt leisten? Definitiv. Und ich bin mir sicher, dass so ziemlich jede Branche einen Beitrag leisten kann. Schon alleine, wenn man eben nicht mehr die „Dollarzeichen“ im Fokus hat, sondern eben das wirklich wichtige. Wenn nicht Stroncton, was würdest du sonst machen? Das ist eine gute Frage…ich würde mich wahrscheinlich an den Schreibtisch setzen, kritzeln, irgendwann mal denken „hey…das sieht ja gar nicht so blöd aus“. Dafür würde ich mir einen Namen überlegen, und dann wieder eine Brand starten <U+0001F642> Auf jeden Fall würde ich wieder etwas beginnen, wo ich zu 100% Spaß daran habe. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja, ich bin echt verdammt neugierig was neue Sachen anbelangt. Am Anfang bin ich teilweise immer ein echter Scheisser, aber ich versuchs dann trotzdem das eine oder andere auszuprobieren und zu wagen. Beispiel eine Rede an der FH Krems zu halten…ich wollte unbedingt wissen wie Stroncton rüber kommt…das erfahre ich aber nur wenn ich mich dem eben stelle und es ausprobiere. Aus Fehlern lernt man unheimlich viel, darum bin ich echt immer ziemlich offen für alles <U+0001F642> Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Dich nicht geben würde? Ein Haufen blöder Sprüche..haha Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Zurzeit: Großteils im Wohnzimmer welches gleichzeitig mit einem Schreibtisch ausgestattet ist. Mein Ziel ist jedoch von überall aus arbeiten zu können wo ich WLAN habe, zumindest für meine Design-Arbeiten. Sei es am See oder irgendwo in einem Hostel in Vietnam, das wär schon echt cool. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? In letzter Zeit ziemlich oft aufs Fortgehen am Wochenende, auf das lange Ausschlafen am Wochenende und aufs längere Schlafen unter der Woche. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste dabei ist meine Ideen als erstes auf Papier zu zeichnen und diese dann auf T-Shirts oder Hoodies usw. zu bringen. Diese Produkte finden dann Platz bei Menschen auf der ganzen Welt die mit ihrem Kauf super glücklich sind. Gleichzeitig wurde auch noch einem Kind in Tansania ermöglicht Skateboard fahren zu können und einen coolen Tag zu haben. Dieser Gedanke macht mich extrem happy <U+0001F642> Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Auf jeden Fall meine Freundin Vanessa, meine Eltern, Geschwister und verdammt coole Freunde die mir immer wieder unter die Arme greifen. Meine Mum hilft mir zB. beim Labels anbringen, mein Bruder macht Produktfotos, meine Freundin hilft mir in der Buchhaltung und meine Freunde unterstützen mich on the Road bei Märkten und Pop Up Shops. IHR SEIT ECHT DIE GEILSTEN <U+0001F642> Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Meine Freundin gibt mir echt immer motivierende Worte wenns gerade nicht so läuft oder wenn gerade mal ein Durchhänger aktuell ist. Das ist echt sehr sehr cool. Auch meine Eltern machen mir immer wieder Mut meinen Weg zu gehen. Bin echt dankbar dafür, dass sie so hinter mir stehen. Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Wir haben noch einiges vor, ja <U+0001F642> Aber das wird nach und nach ans Tageslicht geholt. Jetzt hab ich auch endlich mehr Zeit für alles, und die Story beginnt dann erst so richtig <U+0001F642> Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Indem ich selbst zu 110% begeistert und motiviert bin ist es viel einfacher andere Menschen zu begeistern. Das liegt glaub ich einfach daran, dass es wirklich genau das ist was ich machen möchte <U+0001F642> und was noch wichtig ist, auch über sich selbst lachen zu können wenn man mal etwas verbockt hat <U+0001F642> Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden es echt cool dass ich mich so einsetze und unterstützen mich echt super. TOP. Ich weiß, dass es teilweise blöd ist, da ich beim einen oder anderen Treffen nicht dabei sein kann, aber sie haben immer volles Verständnis und das ist echt toll. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Oh ja, da gibts einige. Ich habe das letzte Buch eigentlich für meine Matura gelesen und mir gedacht…ok…lesen ist nicht mein ding. Aber seit einem Jahr lese ich jeden Tag und es ist echt Hammer. Ich lerne somit immer etwas Neues. Also hier meine hier ein paar Empfehlungen: Matthew Mockridge – Dein nächstes großes Ding Tim Ferris – Die 4 Stundenwoche Alex Hartmann – Mit dem Elefanten durch die Wand Austin Kleon – Show Your Work Anthony Robbins – Unlimited Power Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Den David Lugmayr von Easygoinc Longboard bzw. das Team von Easygoinc Longboards. Die machen ziemlich coole Sachen, und ich denke, die folgen auch ihrer Leidenschaft <U+0001F642> ….gibt es sonst noch Geschichten, Erfahrungen die du uns erzählen willst?!? Auch wenn dir das Gesicht sprichwörtlich mit der Faust geschminkt wird – immer wieder einmal mehr aufstehen, immer nach vorne schauen und die positiven Aspekte an einer vielleicht negativen Situation suchen!

How often do you eat at a different restaurant or try a drink other than your ‘usual’? How often do you think outside the box? Too often we get caught in futile patterns and developed habits, limiting our creativity and free thinking. Here at Impact Hub we believe that understanding our patterns brings us closer to a society driven by collaboration, openness, trust & fairness. Breaking Patterns is a festival that celebrates and encourages thinking differently. More than 170 participants took part in presentations, workshops and exhibitions which forced them to use a part of their brain that is usually tucked away and resting in a corner. How did we do this? We pulled together the best presenters and exhibitors from a range of topics, including virtual reality, blockchain technology, leadership, economic growth, diversity and the way we work. We used a variety of locations throughout the 7th district in Vienna to stimulate conversation, challenge frameworks and foster positive development. Throughout the course of the event, participants could chose attend sessions that stimulated them. First up was the choice between financial technology (blockchain technology) and an intriguingly titled session ‘Burning out? – From fucking yourself up to effectively achieving your goals’. Shermin Voshmgir, founder of BlockchainHub talked about what Blockchain was and how a decentralized web is the way forward, challenging the old system of technology where the server is King and instead implement a system where information is verified by a peer-to-peer network. Shermin Voshmgir talking to the group about Blockchain. Over in Grinberg Practice, Veronika Fiegl a senior trainer of the Grinberg Method, taught us how to listen to your body to change your life patterns. Later in the afternoon reality was brought home to participants in the (My Virtual) Reality session, when they viewed a video report by Austrian daily newspaper Wiener Zeitung. The report showed life in the Lebanese refugee camp Moussa Taleb not far from the Syrian border and introduced us to teenagers Aysha and Abdallah. After this report, participants were able to meet and speak with Adib that lives in a shared flat for refugees in “Magdas Hotel”. We discussed diversity with experts across the fields of education, LGBTIQ, age, migration, homelessness. We talked about why it is important to break down the silos and have real conversations to break down prejudices and disintegration that lead to polarization and conflict. Presenters Elena, Markus and Tobias talked about working within new management structures and practices and how this can enhance our work. This is a break from the traditional employment and structure and encourages employees to work better together. Elena Tzara (Premium Cola), Markus Stelzmann (Tele Haase), Tobias Göllner (ShiftYard) during ‘The way we work’ presentation. During the entertaining and humorous presentation by Tomáš Sedlácek, he discussed empty promises and unfulfilled desires leading to multiple depressive elements of growth-capitalism. You can view the live stream of this chat on Facebook. Christian Felber and Tomáš Sedlácek during the Economic Growth session Amongst all these sessions participants were able to wander through our space and view the Breaking Patterns exhibition, put on by 4 talented artists, as well as an installation by Sebastian Rahs and Rainer Wachter of Woodsaw. After a huge afternoon, participants gathered at Gallery Westlicht to enjoy dinner from Iss Mich and wrap up the day. 8 presenters were selected from the 8 groups and had 3 mins each to summarise. Not all the presenters were the group leaders – some were participants who instead of simply giving a wrap up, told inspiring stories about how the session impacted them. After all, this was what the day was about, inspiring people to break a pattern and make a change.

"81","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/11/04/tedx-out-there/","ImpactHub","TEDx – Out There","TEDx Vienna’s 2016 ‘OUT THERE’ event happened. And it was amazing. For those of you that are unfamiliar with TEDx, it is a conference based on the TED Talks format, organized locally by volunteers. Speakers at TEDx events come from all over the world and across every discipline. Impact Hub Vienna loves Out There ideas and so we decided to head out to the TEDx conference to see what it was all about. In this post we bring back some of the conference experiences for you and what we saw at our booth. The Event ModeratorsA group of us went to TEDx early on Saturday morning to set up a mini Hub at the event, complete with all the comforts of Impact Hub Vienna. There was a chill out corner piled high with colourful cushions, a table that people could work at if they wished, a charging station and iPads to view our new digital members wall (which was really cool). If you haven’t filled out your member profile then you are missing out! And so is everyone else at Impact Hub Vienna – pictures on the digital members wall mean that people will recognize you and can read up on your projects in advance. It is a little like being a celebrity. When my picture and profile came up on the board, I was astounded. People kept stopping by and we made a number of connections and handed out free day passes. So do not be surprised if you see some new faces sitting at the Impact Hub co-workign tables or the hosts taking people on tours through out the Hub! We also had some interesting conversations as a result of the TEDx speakers – everything from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity and the Twin Paradox to questions of medical ethics as a result of the CRISPR project, which uses viruses to perform a process known as genome editing, was discussed. Jacob SmilgThe expert speakers came from a range of areas, including cosmoparticle physics and time travel (or theoretical physics as the discipline is actually known). The youngest student at Oxford University, 11-year old Joshua Beckford, composed a particularly poignant and poetic call to help the planet, which he read on-stage to an enraptured audience. A young American innovator named Jacob Smilg took the stage to tell us about his experiences making a communication device for his friend who suffers from severe disabilities. The final speakers of the day encouraged us to be open-minded about all of our experiences, including mortician Caitlin Doughty appealing to us to think for ourselves and become more involved in the processes of living and dying. Caitlin DoughtyRemember, no idea is truly out of reach and TEDx Vienna proved that there is someone working on the ideas that you think are the most out there. Take inspiration from the speakers at TEDx and keep working on your idea, project, or venture. Every one of these speakers had to overcome obstacles in order to fulfill their dreams, from the belief that time travel is impossible, to the assumption that you cannot cure genetic diseases or overcome autism. So go dream BIG!","November 4, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TEDx-Out-There-cover-photo-ed-png-600x400.png"

Giving old clothes a new life","On the last Sunday of October, Hub Members, friends, friends of friends, and a few curious passersby stepped out of the chill of a dreary day to spend a fun and warm afternoon at Impact Hub for the year’s first Hub Swap event. The swap first started as a small clothing swap between Laura Mosquera and a few friends but quickly grew and grew to the point where Laura decided to open it up to others. Fueled by coffee from the Iss mich Bistro and a buffet of delicious home-made desserts which included spice cake, marble cake, and banana-coconut muffins, everyone made good use of the fitting rooms as they swapped their old clothes to search for something new. A large selection of clothing was available from your standard sweaters and t-shirts to accessories like bracelets, earrings, and everyone’s favourite eel tie. Heels, sandals, bags, purses, trainers, hats, shawls, blazers, there was something for everyone. There was even a Dirndl up for grabs! As the afternoon turned to evening, after plenty of clothes had been swapped and the event was about to end, there were some items left. Clothing imbued with the history of their previous owners, of relaxing afternoons and parties gone by lay patiently on tables still waiting for a second or possibly even a third life. I wondered what would happen to them. Would they get another chance? Good news! They would. All clothes that were leftover from the Hub Swap were donated to Caritas. A big thank you to the main organizers of the Hub Swap: Laura, Sophie, Johanna, Taki, Julia, and all the volunteers who contributed like Tina, Helena, and Nadine. And another special thanks to Danae for opening up the Iss mich Bistro on a Sunday afternoon. If you were too busy and missed this wonderful event, don’t worry! As a result of extremely positive feedback and demand, a future Hub Swap event is in the works. The target date is sometime next year so stay tuned!

"83","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/12/01/tobias-gollner-innovation-heist-auch-zukunft-gestalten/","ImpactHub","Tobias Göllner “Innovation heißt auch Zukunft gestalten.”","Tobias Göllner ist der Gründer von ShiftYard. ShiftYard’s Ziel ist es, Menschen zu ermöglichen, die Zukunft ihrer Organisationen mitzugestalten und eigene Impulse innerhalb des Unternehmens zu setzen. Tobias begeistert sich dabei für “Corporate Entrepreneurship” und (digitale) Produkt- und Serviceentwicklung, inspiriert von Start-ups und Silicon Valley Giganten. Zu seinen Kunden zählen sowohl Großunternehmen als auch Start-up Inkubatoren. Auf die Zeit in einem Salzburger Kreativgymnasium folgte bei ihm ein klassisches WU-Studium, eine lehrreiche Zeit in der Strategieberatung, der Schwenk in die Start-up Szene mit dem Aufbau der Innovation-Unit “Discover” bei Pioneers.io und die Gründung von ShiftYard im September 2014. Was treibt Dich an? Ich sehe, dass Menschen heute oft nicht mehr nur brav ihre Pflicht erfüllen wollen, sondern mit ihren eigenen Ideen und Impulsen die Zukunft ihrer Unternehmen gestalten möchten. Davon profitiert dann auch das Unternehmen selbst, da bin ich überzeugt und da möchte ich mit dem Thema Entrepreneurship & Intrapreneurship beitragen. Wann hast Du das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship für dich entdeckt? Meine erste persönliche unternehmerische Erfahrung habe ich bei der Organisation von Drum’n’Bass Clubbings gemacht. Wir haben damals elektronische Musik produziert und der einfachste Weg sie einem Publikum zu präsentieren war selbst Events zu organisieren. Der unternehmerische Aspekt dabei hat mir dann aber genauso gut gefallen wie der künstlerische. Der unternehmerische Background in der Familie, die Studienzeit, das Umfeld in der Strategieberatung und vor allem meine Zeit beim Start-up Netzwerk Pioneers haben dazu geführt, dass ich mich jetzt auch auf einer anderen Ebene damit beschäftige. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Diese Geschichte war auch irgendwie einer der Auslöser für die Gründung von ShiftYard: Für einen Innovationstag eines großen österreichischen Unternehmens hatten wir u.a. auch Start-ups eingeladen, deren Pitch-Zeit über eine Verkehrsampel gesteuert wurde. Zwei Wochen später klingelte dann das Telefon und unser Kunde wollte sich die Ampel ausborgen um die Redezeit im internen Meeting zu begrenzen – „weil da immer Alle so lange quasseln.“ Da hat man also den „Elevator Pitch“ von der Start-up Welt kopiert. Was ist das besondere an ShiftYard? Was ist bei Euch anders? Wir sind ein Netzwerkunternehmen, das heißt wir gestalten die Projekte für unsere Kunden zwar selbst, holen aber immer Top-Freelancer aus unserem Netzwerk mit dazu, die bei neuen (oft digitalen) Themen führend sind. So arbeiten wir mit Innovationsteams an neuen Produkten und Services und unterstützen gleichzeitig auch die Schaffung der notwendigen kulturellen und organisatorischen Voraussetzungen im Unternehmen, z.B. über Intrapreneurship. Wie schaut ein Arbeitstag bei Tobias Göllner aus? Am liebsten bin ich direkt beim Kunden. Ansonsten fühlen wir uns im Co-Working Space ImpactHub sehr wohl, viele Leute mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, haben wir auch dort kennen gelernt. Du arbeitest ja sehr viel mit Menschen, auch aus unterschiedlichen Ländern, zusammen. Was fasziniert dich dabei? Ich finde man sieht oft die guten Seiten der Globalisierung, nämlich dass wir einen globalen Austausch haben, beispielsweise was Produktentwicklungsmethoden betrifft. Die Profis in Europa arbeiten mit den gleichen Tools wie die im Silicon Valley. Wenn man dann dort ist, merkt man einerseits, dass wir hier wie dort alle “mit Wasser kochen” und trotzdem von den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen profitieren. Was gefällt Dir am Unternehmertum? Selbst verantwortlich zu sein für Erfolg und Misserfolg. Und warum ist es dann genau dieses Projekt geworden? Ich habe viel Zeit im Start-up Umfeld verbracht und dabei meine Leidenschaft für das Thema Innovation bzw. Produkt- und Serviceentwicklung gefunden. Gleichzeitig sieht man, dass vielen Menschen in Unternehmen das Methodenwissen dazu fehlt, und daher weniger Ideen umgesetzt werden, als eigentlich möglich. ShiftYard soll dazu beitragen, dass Konzepte öfter, schneller, nutzerorientierter und damit erfolgreicher umgesetzt werden. Du könntest wahrscheinlich auch einen feinen Bürojob haben, warum hast Du dich für den Weg in die Selbständigkeit entschieden? Selbstständig macht man sich nur, wenn es auch gerade zur jeweiligen Lebenssituation passt. Bei mir war es einfach auch genau die richtige Zeit, um das Abenteuer zu wagen. Mit der Entscheidung zwischen Fixanstellung und Selbständigkeit wählt man denke ich auch einen Lifestyle. Es gibt aber auf jeden Fall auch coole Jobs in größeren Unternehmen. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Zu sehen, dass unsere Kunden am Ende des Tages wirklich etwas umsetzen. Wir wollen dafür sorgen, dass nichts für die Schublade produziert wird. Bist Du eine neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich interessiere mich sehr für neue Technologien und teste da gerne neue Lösungen, sowohl privat als auch für das Unternehmen (z.B. Produktivitätstools). Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Das sind von privater Seite meine Frau und unsere Familien und im täglichen Business unser Partnernetzwerk. ShiftYard ist ein Netzwerkunternehmen, wir leben Kooperation sehr offen und machen Projekte gemeinsam und vertrauensvoll. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Mein Ziel war immer selbstständig, aber als Team zu operieren, in dem man sich auch gegenseitig weiter bringt. Da bin ich sehr froh darüber, mit Michael Thurow und Ulla Bartel zusammen zu arbeiten. Wohin wird Dich diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Ja, wir haben viele Ideen, die mit ShiftYard oder in neuen Konstellationen umgesetzt werden können. Wir sind bereits jetzt auch über die Grenzen Österreichs hinaus tätig und wollen uns geografisch auch nicht beschränken. Was das Leistungsangebot angeht, muss man immer ein gutes Gleichgewicht finden zwischen Weiterentwicklung und Fokussierung. Viel wird derzeit in Österreich über Start Ups geredet. Kaum ein Tag vergeht ohne einer neuen Initiative. Wie siehst Du Österreich als Start Up Land? Es gibt mittlerweile eine sehr positive Stimmung und breite Unterstützung für Gründerinnen, Gründer und Start-ups. Jetzt gilt es einerseits kritisch weitere Verbesserungen einzufordern und gleichzeitig nicht ins Jammern zu verfallen. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? Abgesehen von der politischen Unterstützung und dem Bürokratieabbau sollte weiter am Thema Entrepreneurship Education gearbeitet werden. Gründen muss eine echte Karrierealternative sein – aber auch das Handwerkszeug dazu muss vermittelt werden. Menschen wie Johannes Lindner (u.a. auch Ashoka fellow) arbeiten da bereits sehr erfolgreich daran. Hast Du einen Tipp unsere LeserInnen? Innovators are made, not born! Innovation kann man lernen und es gibt unendlich viele Ressourcen, die man da anzapfen kann. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Innovation heißt auch Zukunft gestalten. Gesellschaftlich würde ich mir wünschen, dass wir an einer Zukunft arbeiten, in der das Miteinander und die Zusammenarbeit im Vordergrund steht, zwischen Menschen, Kulturen, Ländern, Branchen, Mitbewerbern, Kunden, Lieferanten, ….

"84","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2016/12/06/a-conversation-with-veronika-fiegl/","ImpactHub","Becoming stronger through fear – a conversation with Veronika Fiegl"," I walk into the Chill Out Room at Impact Hub trying really hard not to show that I had just sprinted from Zieglergasse to be on time. Veronika Fiegl is not one to waste time – she offers some water and tells me to take off my shoes and socks and sit on the massage table set in the middle of the room, feet facing her. My session was booked spontaneously: Veronika visits Impact Hub every two months for special free one to one sessions available exclusively to the Impact Hub community members. It just happened that her last one collided with my search for an inspiring Impact Hub member to interview (which she totally is). Veronika immediately started rubbing my feet to discover pressure points indicating where my body is tense. The idea is that since we stand on our feet all day, they are the best tellers of how our body behaves under different circumstances. She correctly diagnosed my chronic neck and back problem, as well as served an awesome side dish of psychoanalysis, which left me stupefied. When I asked her how did she know, she simply responded “It is all here. You are carrying all the stress and the issue, which had caused it, around with you”. Meet Veronika Fiegl, the Grinberg Method practitioner Let’s start with an introduction. What do you do? I practice the Grinberg Method in different forms: as individual and group sessions. You have been self-employed for the last 15 years successfully treating people through touch. How did you come across the Grinberg Method? I found a gift voucher in Billa which said ‘free foot analysis’ (laughs). I had no idea what it was, actually I thought it is something cosmetics related, which I don’t care about. At first I didn’t take the gift voucher. I walked out of Billa and then I had a sort of a shock going through me: ‘I need this gift voucher!’. I ran back, took it, looked at it for the next three weeks. In the end I finally went to have that foot analysis and it was the first time I had the impression that somebody really sees me. Somebody is not fooled by my pretense and does not buy my theater, sort of. I felt that somebody really sees my issues. That was fascinating. When did you become a practitioner yourself? I was just a client for a year and I didn’t ever think about it. Then my sister thought she would become a practitioner and I had to gather all the information for her. While I was doing that, I started to become curious, to understand that this is not a massage, but something very empowering. This method really believes in us being fundamentally intelligent creatures. We have all the talents we need to thrive, to do in life what we want. If you are confident, if you trust yourself, you know what to do. What in your own words is the core value, the key message of the Grinberg Method? The idea of the Grinberg Method is that by learning to feel your body again, you rediscover your talents. You become who you actually are and then you sit well in your life and have much fewer problems. We look at what is somebody’s potential, which you can see in the body, and then how that somebody is actually using their potential. There can be a big difference between who they could be and who they actually made themselves to be at the moment. For example some people could naturally be extremely outgoing but for some reason they learned to be shy in their life. Experiencing life through the body… That sounds as if the method was taking us away from the focus on the mind, which right now prevails. When it comes to physicality, we often only talk about general fitness – the body is maintained like a well-oiled machine to prevent failure in the crucial moments. My question is: where does the Grinberg Method fit? I would say what the Grinberg Method calls being a body is a very different perception to what you just described. You basically described what the society thinks: we are all thinking heads and then we have this machine that should be pretty, slim and work. Grinberg Method says that thinking is also a part of your body, you cannot think without your body. The idea of the Grinberg Method is not to be physical without the mind- the idea is to balance it. Being a body means that you have all of your abilities available to you and not one part of you is more important than the rest. Imagine that you are in a severe pain – you cannot think straight because you are in pain, right? However, if you are very relaxed, your head is clear, your thoughts can flow. This exact gap between what we call our mind and the rest of our body, became almost a war zone in our society. So one of the elements of the Grinberg Method, ‘taking the focus away from the mind’, does not actually mean prioritizing the body? I wouldn’t say it’s being physical against the mind, not at all. It’s teaching you to be you from head to toe, with the aim of finding maximum balance to have the life that you want without screwing that up with tensions, with low confidence, with judging yourself, doubting yourself. We look at all the places where people really make their own life difficult: from simply not breathing deep enough to judging yourself and doubting yourself, giving yourself commands, pushing yourself. This is how we stab ourselves in the back. We, the Grinberg Method practitioners, say ‘Feel what you do to yourself’. Feel yourself, be aware of yourself. For example if you constantly judge yourself, you feel that it is nasty, it’s horrible, it’s actually painful. If you are aware of yourself, if you feel that it is painful, then you can decide if you really want to do this. What you are describing, being confronted with a situation we learned to be stressed about and start taking short breaths or tense up, sounds like a bad habit. Is there a pattern for these bad physical habits to form? Is there a reason that one person develops a habit of bad posture when overwhelmed and another won’t? I would say it is personal but we also live in a culture. There are always other people around you, so there are cultural patterns. Most of us sit a lot, we control our neck and shoulders a lot, there is a cultural tendency It doesn’t mean that everybody has to react certain way. We have personal choice in deciding if my breathing will be shallow or not. You can continue to breathe even if everybody else is gasping. In the end it is individual how you react and we can change it. Would you say that practicing the Grinberg Method yourself has changed you? If you look at the photographs of me when I was sixteen I looked twice as old as I look now, because I was much more tense, worried, serious. I was trying to show that I am somebody else. Now, when something bad happens, I have much more confidence that I can deal with it. I waste less energy on tensing up and worrying. It means I actually have more energy free to think of an actual solution. In the past I was a good pupil, I worked very hard and I pushed myself to achieve what I thought was important for me. At the end I was exhausted; I was tired, my back was hurting and I didn’t trust my own abilities at all. Now it is completely different. I have a life that I chose and if I don’t like something in my life, I know that I can change it. You just mentioned that you were doubting yourself. At Impact Hub we talk a lot about anxiety, fear of failure, stress. How our body learning bad physical habits in reaction to negative situations translate into self-doubt? I think doubting ourselves is a bad habit that we learn from other people too. I know for sure I learned it from my family. Because we not only learn postures from other people, we learn feelings, we learn how to think. We don’t allow ourselves to be who we are. We constantly have to keep ourselves in check, say the right thing, perform. There is so much energy stuck in these rules of who you can and cannot be.It’s like a plant which has been cut too much. You weaken it. How long have been going to Impact Hub to give Grinberg Method sessions? I think it’s either 2 or 3 years… In that time you must have seen enough community members to know what are the most common issues they are facing. What is the struggle that most people face? All Hubbers whom I have met were people that had a purpose, a vision, a dream, who want something in life. What I have seen many times is that they put themselves under pressure because they want something badly. It’s like their business was their baby, and I completely understand because my business is my baby, and because of that they suffer from a specific type of self-inflicted pressure. They feel that they have to succeed, not like in the corporate world of trying to make your boss happy, but on a more personal level. Being afraid of failing is another thing. They are not relaxing with this fear, because unless we train it, nobody tells us to try that. I know a lot of people who do not take enough breaks, don’t relax enough, who don’t stop thinking about their job at all. People who either exploit or run in the danger of exploiting themselves. Along with this fear is the worry about money. Money is a big issue for a lot of Hubbers I have met. The important part of your observations is fear: of failure, of not being enough, of not having enough money. The Grinberg Method states that fear is an important part of our lives because it can be turned around and used to propel our goals instead of damaging us. So how do I do that? This is something you really need to learn through your body. The theory is really easy- basically ‘Be afraid and then relax’. That’s it. Breathe, relax, allow the fear. But this is exactly something that you need to learn as an experience through the body, because usually we learn as a physical habit to block fear, to not want fear. It is a bit like having a constipation of fear. Learning to let if flow again is something that we can learn best from body to body. That fear is not always irrational because for us, self-employed people, money is an issue and the fear that maybe the business will not go so well, comes from the fact that you simply just don’t know. I had so many ups and downs of my business, sometimes I had more money that I knew how to spend, and sometimes I had just about enough money. In this sense I would say it is not irrational to be afraid as a self-employed person. You will be afraid, constantly. But, the way this fear feels for you – this can change dramatically. For me in the past it was panic. Now, I don’t experience it like this anymore, because I relax into it and it actually becomes just energy waking me up. It doesn’t feel like it used to feel because I don’t block it anymore. The interesting thing is that when you really stop fighting it, it is not the monster that you thought it once was. But what happens when somebody, a business person like our Impact Hub members, is blocking the fear constantly? It means they lose money because they are wasting energy in themselves. I always tell my clients when I find very tense places in their bodies that this point is almost like a bank account that you forgot about. You invest energy into closing this area of your body. Doing this makes you more tired, it makes you older, it makes you less inventive, less creative. As a business person these are qualities you need: you need your brain, you need to be able to think, to see opportunities, to dare, to act. If you stand around shy and wait hoping somebody will find you, it gets hard. I really think being panicked, worry is too expensive for us business people. We cannot afford it. As a finish line, I wanted to ask you if you have a simple method for people who will read this interview, which they could apply every day to de-stress themselves. Most of us work in front of the computer a lot, so there is one exercise that I would suggest, not only to do once per day but often, during breaks. Before you start working, take a few really, really deep breaths. Feel how you sit on the chair, allow your weight to sink into the chair. Feel the feet on the floor. Then, if you want to, close your eyes, and for a few minutes just breath and feel that you exist as a body. Breathe and pay attention to your body. Be aware and enter the situation with all of your body. Some of my clients have a pop up in their calendar that says ‘breathe’ or set an alarm to remind themselves to spend a few minutes feeling their body. I recommend that too. Thank you for your time, Veronika!","December 6, 2016","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/becoming-stronger-through-fear-a-conversation-with-veronika-fiegl-cover-photo1-600x400.png"

Sie hat Filmwissenschaft und Komparatistik in Wien studiert. Nach dem Studium ging es für Rita einmal in den Kunst- und Kulturbereich. Zu den Tätigkeiten zählten unter anderem Produktionsleitung für Kino unter Sternen am Karlsplatz, Assistenz Pressebüro Salzburger Festspiele, Produktionen für FM4, Ö1, Mischief Films, u.v.m. Und dann ist die Idee aufgekommen einen vegetarischen Lieferservice aufzuziehen. Und im Februar 2014 war es dann soweit. Gemeinsam mit Gerald Költringer wurde Rita bringt´s gegründet und schon im April wurden die ersten Kunden mit vegetarischem BIO Essen verwöhnt. Die Auslieferung erfolgt vom ersten Tag an mit dem Lastenrad. Wie würdest Du Dich beschreiben und was versteckt sich hinter Rita bringt´s? Am zufriedensten bin ich, wenn ich gut gegessen habe. Meistens bin ich also sehr zufrieden. Und wenn dem nicht so ist, bin ich optimistisch genug, um mich immer noch glücklich zu schätzen. Was ich gar nicht mag, sind pessimistisch denkende Menschen und „Owizahra“ und wenn mir jemand vorsätzlich ins Gesicht lügt. Außerdem mag ich Kühe und ihre Umgebung – Wiesen, Alm und Berge. Ich bin fürchterlich emotional, mich kann ein positives oder negatives Wort meines Gegenübers genauso schnell zu Tränen rühren wie ein guter Gedanke, eine schöne Erinnerung oder ein guter Film. Rita bringt’s ist Wiens erster Lieferservice für vegetarisches BIO Mittagessen, per Lastenrad geliefert. Wir haben ein von der Vorbestellung der Speisen über ihre Zubereitung und Auslieferung, bis hin zu den biologisch abbaubaren Verpackungen nachhaltiges Konzept aufgebaut, bei dem es uns zudem wichtig ist, dass auch unsere derzeit 23 Mitarbeiter/innen fair angestellt und entlohnt werden. Wir kochen mit besten BIO Zutaten und arbeiten vor allem mit Wertschätzung für das, was wir tun. Was treibt Dich an? Ein schier unendlicher Tatendrang, manche nennen es Rastlosigkeit. Die Lust, wirklich viel zu arbeiten und damit etwas zu bewegen. Die Liebe zu dem, was ich tue und damit ändern kann und nicht zuletzt der Wille, von einem nachhaltig arbeitenden Unternehmenskonzept leben zu können. Welche Bedeutung hat gesunde Ernährung für Dich? Gesunde Ernährung hat einen sehr hohen Stellenwert in meinem Leben, schon seit dem Kindesalter. Ich wurde von meiner Mutter dahingehend geprägt – sie hat mir bis zu meiner Matura täglich eine gesunde Jause für die Schule vorbereitet (teilweise sogar eigepackt oder bis zur Haustür nachgetragen), wenn ich wieder nachhause gekommen bin, hat auf mich jeden Tag ein frisch gekochtes Essen gewartet. Da gab’s kein Cola, keine Chips und kein fettiges Essen und mir hat wirklich nix gefehlt. Wertvolle Zutaten und eine gesunde Zubereitung waren selbstverständlich. Dass das nicht selbstverständlich ist, habe ich erst in meiner Zeit als Studentin in Wien gelernt, aber versuche seit dem Tag die von zuhause gewohnte Qualität beizubehalten. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Lebensmittel in deinem Leben ein? Ich beschäftige mich nicht nur beruflich, sondern auch privat am liebsten damit. Egal, ob es um Land- und Viehwirtschaft, Einkauf, Herkunft, Geschichte oder ihre Verarbeitung in der Küche dreht, Lebensmittel interessieren mich brennend, im ernährungstheoretischen, chemischen, gesellschaftlichen, philosophischen oder kulturellen Sinne. Bei rita bringt´s versuchst du ja in allen Bereichen einen neuen und vor allem sehr nachhaltigen Weg zu gehen. Warum in dieser Ganzheitlichkeit? Weil es logisch ist. Weil wir ein Konzept in die Welt setzen wollten, bei dem ein sinnvoller Gedanke den nächsten ergibt. Weil wir uns für nichts rechtfertigen müssen und auch niemanden anlügen müssen, wenn wir erklären, was wir tun. Weil wir eine Marke aufbauen wollten, der man bedingungslos vertrauen kann. Weil wir Meilensteine setzen wollen und weil ich vor allem mit meiner Persönlichkeit und meinen Werten, nicht zuletzt mit meinem Namen dafür einstehe. Warum vegetarisch? Warum bio? Vegetarisch, weil ich mich seit ca. 15 Jahren vegetarisch ernähre. Ich habe vom Elternhaus einen sehr bodenständigen Bezug zu Viehhaltung und Landwirtschaft mitbekommen, gelernt, was woher kommt und warum. Meine Entscheidung, fleischlos zu leben, kam nach und nach, weniger aus ethischen Gründen, aber vielmehr aus geschmacklichen, ich wollte einfach kein Fleisch mehr essen, mir hat davor gegraut. Für mich bedeutet eine vegetarische ausgewogene Ernährung ein gesundes Leben (ich war seit meinem 12. Lebensjahr nicht mehr krank), vegetarisch oder vegan bezieht sich außerdem nicht mehr nur auf unser Essen, sondern für mich auch auf eine Lebenseinstellung, eine bedachte Haltung gegenüber Mensch und Tier und allem Leben. BIO, weil es einfach die schonendere und gesündere Anbauweise für Boden und Mensch ist. 100% BIO, weil wir eine Marke sein wollen, der man ohne Kompromiss und Sternderl vertrauen kann. Wir sind der Meinung, dass unser Essen damit gerade für jene, die täglich viele Stunden im Büro verbringen, eine gute Entscheidung ist, um danach mit neuer Energie weiterzuarbeiten. Hat es für „Rita bringt´s“ einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Die Initiative kam im Februar 2014 von meinem Schwager Gerald, der bei einer Recherche festgestellt hat, dass es so ein ganzheitliches Angebot in Wien noch nicht gab. Wir haben schon mal zusammengearbeitet, haben eine sehr ähnliche Arbeitsmoral und er wusste von mir, dass ich in meinem damaligen Arbeitsumfeld nicht sonderlich zufrieden war. Er hat mich gefragt, ob wir so etwas gemeinsam machen wollen und hat damit offenbar bei mir einen roten Schalter umgelegt – ich wollte sofort und für uns waren rasch die Grundprinzipien klar. Innerhalb von zwei Monaten haben wir alles aufgebaut, der 1. April 2014 ist der Geburtstag von RITA bringt’s, an dem wir quasi von einem auf den anderen Tag für 40 Personen gekocht und geliefert haben. Wo siehst Du dich in den nächsten Jahren? Kurzfristig wollen wir gerade alles verbessern, was wir uns in sehr kurzer Zeit angefangen haben. Prozesse optimieren, Abläufe verkürzen, Strukturen stabilisieren. Damit denken wir dann längerfristig an ein Franchise Konzept im deutschsprachigen Raum und darüber hinaus. In welches Spezialgebiet es mich damit treibt, ist für mich noch unklar, uns stehen wirklich viele Herausforderungen bevor, auf die ich mich freue. In den nächsten Jahren – die Frage ist sehr weit gegriffen. Ich bin noch keine 30, aber in den nächsten vielen Jahren sehe ich mich zumindest nicht mehr in der Stadt, sondern am Land, mit mehr Platz, mehr Luft, mehr Wiese, mehr Berg. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Ich mag die (anfänglichen) Hürden von Jungunternehmer/innen gar nicht auf konkrete Beispiele beziehen, viel mehr auf andauernde Prozesse. Für mich persönlich geht es kontinuierlich um konsequente Selbstorganisation. Wenn man das gut im Griff hat, arbeitet es sich leichter – egal in welchen Bereichen des täglichen oder nicht alltäglichen Arbeitens ist das für mich sehr oft eine Herausforderung. Ein Führungsstil, mit dem man selbst gut zurande kommt, ist wichtig, den erlernt man auch erst im Umgang mit Mitarbeiter/innen und mit sich selbst – ich zumindest. Bei jedem Rückschlag braucht es nicht nur Halt vom persönlichen Umfeld, sondern vor allem genug Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstmotivation, um doch nicht liegen zu bleiben, sondern wieder vom Boden aufzustehen und weiterzumachen, egal wie müde, demotiviert, enttäuscht, geknickt man ist. Am Ende (und auch am Anfang) geht es natürlich auch um den finanziellen Aspekt. Wir sind kein „klassisches“ Startup, das einen Raketenstart hinlegt, einen Haufen Gewinn macht und innerhalb von zwei Jahren verkauft. Wir sind ein nachhaltig arbeitendes junges Unternehmen, das bedeutet auch, dass wir unsere Arbeitsplätze auch in 10 Jahren noch anbieten wollen. Wir werden damit nie reich werden, vor allem dauert es länger, bis wir überhaupt davon leben können. Das braucht einen langen Atem und die Bereitschaft auf Vieles zu verzichten. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ja sehr. Mich interessiert prinzipiell alles. Ich habe auch überlegt, zum Beispiel Physik zu studieren, weil mich die Materie unendlich fasziniert – habe dann aber festgestellt, dass mir dafür in der Tiefe das Vorwissen und die nötige Denkweise fehlt. Ich hinterfrage gerne alles, womit ich zu tun habe, wenn ich das auch nicht laut mache, sondern einfach oft lange über etwas nachdenke, um mir danach eine Meinung zu bilden oder mich weiter zu informieren. Ich bin mit einer Information nicht zufrieden, solange ich sie nicht verstehe – dann merke ich es mir auch nicht. Ich bin an Fakten interessiert und am „Wesen“ der Dinge, an einer intelligenten, kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit unserer Welt und unserem Leben. Was bedeutet Glück für Dich? Oh, das ist eine zu große Frage. Ich versuche sie ansatzweise zu beantworten: Glück bedeutet für mich im Großen, dass ich wertschätze und hochhalte, wo ich herkomme, in welches Land, in welche Familie, in welche Zeit, in welches soziale Umfeld ich hineingeboren wurde. Dass ich Verstand und Intellekt habe und gesund bin, nicht zuletzt, dass ich emotional bin. Auf diesen wirklich glücklichen Gegebenheiten, zu denen ich selbst so gar nichts beitragen konnte, baue ich auf und bin nun fähig, seit ich selbst entscheiden kann, etwas dafür zu leisten, um diese zu erhalten.Dann gibt es glückliche Momente. An diesen sind für mich meist auch andere beteiligt, denn Glück ist doch am Schönsten, wenn man es teilen kann. Und da zählen für mich die kleinen Dinge: Herzliches Lachen, die ersten Frühlingsblumen, körperlicher Kontakt, das Verhalten junger Tiere und kleiner Kinder, Sonne im Gesicht, der Moment, wenn man ein Geschenk übergibt, nicht zuletzt richtig gutes Essen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Der Welt? Die meisten Milliarden Menschen dieser Erde wissen gar nicht von uns, insofern nichts. Ein paar Tausende hätten aber ein Gesprächsthema weniger, einige Hunderte würden täglich oder immer wieder mal nur Zeug statt gutem Essen zu sich nehmen. Und etwas mehr als zwei Dutzend hätten einen anderen oder keinen Job. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Meine Leidenschaften sind Kochen, Essen und Lachen, also das, was ich immer und überall von Herzen gerne tue. Dafür muss ich dankenswerterweise auf nichts verzichten. Wenn es darum gehen soll, dass ich meine Leidenschaft zum Beruf gemacht hätte, dann muss ich sagen, dass meine Arbeit und mein Unternehmen nicht meine Leidenschaft, sondern mein Leben geworden sind. Dazu gehört, dass man das, was man am Liebsten tut, im Alltag für das Unternehmen nicht mehr macht, in meinem Fall kochen. Würde ich mich nur darauf konzentrieren, gäbe es keinen Fortschritt, deshalb, um die Frage zu beantworten: ich verzichte aufs Kochen, um das Unternehmen weiterzubringen, aber hole das oft zuhause nach oder dann, wenn ich ganz allein in der ganz großen Küche bin, den Kopf frei habe oder frei bekommen möchte und um mal still zu sein. Viel wird derzeit in Österreich über Start Ups geredet. Kaum ein Tag vergeht ohne einer neuen Initiative. Wie siehst Du Österreich als Start Up Land? Unser Konzept funktioniert in Österreich und vor allem in Wien sehr gut. Als junges Unternehmen und Gründer standen wir natürlich vor einigen bürokratischen und finanziellen Hürden, die es zu überwinden galt, einiges war ärgerlich und einige Umstände auch vermeidbar. Wir haben ziemlich viel Leer- und Lehrgeld bezahlt, weil an manchen Ecken einfach die Beratung gefehlt hat – aber meist auch nur deshalb, weil’s sonst auch niemand besser gewusst hat als wir. Man muss dazu sagen, dass von der Idee bis zur Umsetzung bei uns tatsächlich nur zwei Monate vergangen sind, da war keine Zeit für lange Wege oder viel Herumüberlegen, wir haben’s einfach gemacht. Recht schmerzlich war dann die Erkenntnis, dass wir durch manche Förderprogramme gefallen sind, weil diese nur dann greifen, wenn das Projekt in Planung ist und nicht bereits in der Umsetzung. Darauf bezogen bleibt zu sagen – man möchte als junges Unternehmen von Stadt, Land, Politik und Wirtschaft zu jedem Zeitpunkt unterstützt werden, man sucht da keine Almosen, sondern hat eh schon einen Haufen Mut aufgebracht, um das überhaupt durchzuziehen, da braucht man wirklich keine schiefen Ansagen oder schwindlige Begründungen. Aber dann, wenn man mal erfolgreich ist, klopfen einem alle auf die Schultern und der Wirtschaftsstandort rühmt sich, so viele Arbeitsplätze geschaffen zu haben. Na, wer hat die denn geschaffen, die Wirtschaftskammer vielleicht? Ich glaube, das waren und sind dann doch die (jungen) Unternehmen. Da kann ich nur ganz radikal fordern: runter mit den Lohnnebenkosten, die brechen einem das Genick, vor allem, wenn man faire Arbeitsverhältnisse anbieten will. Naja, wir sind nur teilweise ein Startup, denn die „Definition“ schließt meist auch ein, dass man das Unternehmen nach zwei oder drei Jahren gewinnbringend verkauft. Das ist bei uns wahrlich nicht der Fall, wir denken das Unternehmen weiter, wir stecken so tief in der Materie, es hat so viel Potential, um noch unendlich viele Ideen weiterzuentwickeln – da denken wir nicht an was Neues, Anderes, viel wichtiger ist uns ein nachhaltiges Arbeiten auf allen Ebenen und das ist bei vielen Startups einfach nicht der Fall, weil sie kurzlebig sind und das Konzept auch nicht nachhaltig angesetzt ist. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? Wie schon zuvor erwähnt. Daran anknüpfend – die Erleichterung für Startups, die im Frühjahr dieses Jahres vorgestellt wurden, sind fein, aber warum gelten sie nicht für alle Neugründungen? Sie beziehen sich vorwiegend auf die Tech- und IT Szene, deren Natur es ist, schnell, innovativ und meist auch ohne viel Personalaufwand zu arbeiten. Warum fallen Gastro Startups, Kulturinitiativen, soziale Unternehmen nicht darunter? Weil sie einfach länger und mehr „Pflege“ brauchen um zu wachsen und die Gewinne nicht (sofort) so hoch sind. Ich sag nur BIO Gemüse, da ist’s ähnlich. Schmecken tut’s besser, gesünder ist’s auch – und zwar nicht nur für den menschlichen Körper, sondern für die gesamte Umwelt. Es braucht halt mehr Zuneigung. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Wenn man Entrepreneurship in seiner Definition versteht, dass man den Willen und die Kraft aufbringt, Dinge auf die Beine zu stellen, Ideen zu verwirklichen und etwas zum Laufen zu bringen, mit dem Ziel, damit Geld zu verdienen, egal, welche Risiken einen erwarten – dann ist dass mein tägliches Thema. Wir arbeiten seit nunmehr zweieinhalb Jahren daran, mit einem nachhaltigen Unternehmen Geld zu verdienen, nein, von unserem nachhaltigen Unternehmen zu leben. Das ist bei den sich fast täglich ändernden Einkaufspreisen für Lebensmittel, den niedrigen Margen in der (BIO) Gastronomie, der eher geringen Kaufbereitschaft und den teilweise unberechenbaren Problematiken des Tagesgeschäfts eine größere Herausforderung, als sie bei erster Betrachtung klingen mag. Derzeit leben unsere Mitarbeiter/innen davon. Zugegeben, wir sind ziemlich naiv in die Materie quer-eingestiegen. Aber, und hier komme ich auf die Frage zurück, wir sind realistisch, wir träumen nicht. Wir glauben fest daran, dass das, was wir gepflanzt haben, guten Ertrag bringen wird, wir sprechen nicht von Überfluss. Und wenn ich von Glauben spreche, dann halte ich’s gern mit Anselm Grün: Selbstvertrauen ist göttlich. Wir glauben also an uns selbst, vertrauen auf unsere Fähigkeiten, Stärken und unseren Elan, daran, dass wir das Kind schaukeln können, egal was kommt. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Gemüse. Ich wollte die Antwort eigentlich so stehen lassen, aber ich muss sie doch noch ein bisschen erläutern. Die Arbeit in der Küche ist die Unmittelbarste, die ich je erlebt habe: man hat ein Lebensmittel, das über lange Zeit gediehen ist und geerntet wurde. Das ist das erste Ergebnis der Landwirtschaft, das zu uns kommt. Jetzt kann ich mit meinen eigenen Händen und mit einer Portion Kreativität herbeiführen, dass etwas Besonderes daraus wird. Ich schicke das per Lastenrad und Muskelkraft zu unseren Kund/innen und kann Vieles bewirken: Hunger stillen, Freude hervorrufen (unter anderem auch, weil ich behaupte, dass die Unseren die schönsten FahrradbotInnen sind…) Glücksgefühle sind oft beim Genuss dabei und unser Essen fördert die Gesundheit und damit auch das Wohlbefinden. Die Speise ist verzehrt und in vielen Fällen bekomme ich rasch Rückmeldung. Das ist ein Arbeitsprozess, der innerhalb weniger Stunden abgeschlossen ist und ein (meist) zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis bringt. Das wollen wir doch alle, oder? Das klingt jetzt ziemlich romantisch. Um das abzuschwächen: Küchenarbeit ist verdammt hart. Es ist brütend heiß (ich zähle 12 Brandnarben auf meinen Unterarmen), man ist ständig auf den Beinen, es muss immer schnell gehen, man schleppt, hievt, beansprucht jeden einzelnen Muskel und kleinste Fehler werden nicht verziehen. Man muss geistig und körperlich ein Viech sein, um in einer Küche (jeder Größe) arbeiten zu können. Aber, um auf’s Gemüse zurückzukommen: ich beschäftige mich damit täglich, stündlich, jeden Moment. Egal, ob ich es selbst am Balkon anzubauen versuche, alte und neue Sorten entdecke, die Zutaten einkaufe, neue Kreationen ausprobiere, darüber schreibe, daran rieche, den Biomüll entsorge, die Speisen esse. Gemüse, Früchte, unsere Lebensmittel, die sind das Schönste. Wer ist Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Meine großartigen Eltern, die mir Vieles ermöglicht haben. Mein Vater, den ich gern hervorhebe, obwohl wir im Alltag wenig voneinander hören, aber er hat mich mit seiner Lebensweise und Einstellung zur Arbeit sehr geprägt und jedes Mal, wenn wir uns sehen und miteinander reden, ziehe ich neue Energie aus seinen Worten und vor allem seinen Fragen – die stellt mir sonst einfach niemand und sie zwingen mich im positiven Sinne zum Nachdenken, Umdenken und Verändern. Meine lieben Schwestern, die auf alle Fragen Antworten wissen, weil sie das Meiste selbst schon erlebt haben und mir so ähnlich, wenn auch so anders sind. Meine Freunde, die ich mittlerweile an einer Hand abzählen kann, wirklich selten sehe, aber denen ich emotional und rational verbunden bin. Mein Freund, der mich ins Bett bringt, wenn ich schon wieder am Tisch eingeschlafen bin, der mich trotz seines eigenen übersprudelnden Charakters beruhigen kann und der prinzipiell alles gut findet, was ich tue, mit dem leisen Hinweis, etwas noch besser zu machen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Letzterer. Manchmal auch der Wein. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Geheim nicht. Aber viele Ideen. Ich weiß es nicht, um ehrlich zu sein, momentan ist noch Vieles offen und ungewiss, das stört mich aber nicht. Es gibt viele Dinge, die ich gern machen möchte, die mit Gastro, BIO Lebensmitteln, nachhaltigem Leben, aber auch Kunst zu tun haben – ich bin auf manches Talent und viel Eifer aufmerksam geworden, das möchte ich gern vertiefen oder überhaupt ausprobieren. Erfolg spielt auch eine Rolle, Vieles habe ich erreicht, was ich mir nie erträumt hätte, aber mindestens 90% habe ich noch vor mir, weil ich meist unzufrieden mit dem Ergebnis bin, das bedeutet, dass ich’s immer besser machen möchte, was ich als positiv empfinde. Wenn ich nichts mehr zu arbeiten habe, dann sterbe ich, das ist klar. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Also das weiß ich wirklich nicht, das ist mir sogar ein Rätsel, wie das so oft schon funktionieren konnte. Ich glaube, ich habe viele Lachfalten, die vielleicht Freude hervorrufen… Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Soweit ich das weiß, befürworten alle die Initiative und das Ergebnis. Dass das manchmal mehr als Engagement, nämlich Überforderung und Überlastung bedeutet, ist nicht immer förderlich. Dann betone ich aber, dass ich noch immer gut schlafe und immer lachen kann, dann verstehen’s die meisten. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Einfach machen. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Ein kleiner Lottogewinn wäre nett und würde Manches einfacher machen. Alles andere brauch ich mir nicht wünschen, das muss ich schon selber machen. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Eine Reise nach Georgien.

"89","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/05/6-reasons-why-co-working-is-good-for-you-and-your-business/","ImpactHub","6 reasons why co-working is good for you – and your business","For a while now ‘co-working’ has been a buzzword, but have you taken the time to think about how it can really benefit you? With so many people starting their own business or working on an innovative start up, co-working really will give you the edge you need. Here are six good reasons why… 1. Community Co-working allows you to be surrounded by others just like you, who want to be part of a community. No longer do you have to be isolated at home, you can have ‘colleagues’ without having colleagues. These people can become a sounding board and support system for you, offering advice or opinions when you need it – something that is missing when you work alone. Plus, it gives you some cool people to have lunch with. 2. Collaboration Often times co-working spaces (like Impact Hub Vienna) are incubators for new ventures and start-ups, and a haven for people who are experts in their field. Being a part of this means you have unlimited opportunities to collaborate with others on innovative projects and possibly even snag some new clients. If nothing else, having access to these experts will allow you to seek advice on your own work, saving you time and money. 3. Know what’s going on A co-working community has the pulse of the city and knows what is happening when and where. If you are trying to break into the start up scene or are new to a city, it is likely that your co-working space will be invaluable to you. Talk to other members and ask around about what is happening and what you can be a part of. 4. Inspiration & Creativity Take a peek through the doors of any co-working space and you will often see some of the most talented and creative people the city has to offer. Designers, innovators, storytellers, digital experts – people who join co-working spaces because they want to think (and work) outside the box to create something new. This creativity is infectious and can only have a positive effect on you and your work. Take some time to look at the projects of other members and be inspired. Seeing what is possible can help you break through any blocks you have in your own work. 5. Knowledge In addition to networking and having access to expert members, co-working spaces are often the venue for workshops and training seminars. Sometimes these are formal (the accelerate program) while other times they are simply members helping members (Hubbers helping Hubbers). As a member you get the inside scoop on what events are coming up. 6. Work-life balance While working from home may seem ideal, it is not always the dream that it is portrayed to be. There are a million distractions (hello Netflix!) that can take you off topic at any time of the day. Unless you are super motivated and disciplined, home may not be the most productive place to work. So get out of your house (and your pyjamas) and into Impact Hub!

"90","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/11/dont-tell-you-mother-but-messy-is-awesome/","ImpactHub","Don’t tell your mother … but Messy is awesome!","David Bowie, a travelling mathematician, the famous Building 20 at MIT, and the most human human are all at home in this exploration of creativity, adaptability, and resilience. As New Year’s has only come and gone very recently, the lists that everyone makes with the best of intentions to improve themselves and daily life are still fresh. Everyone vows to lose the Christmas weight, the five kilograms from last year, to read more, become more active, eat better, quit all the bad habits, drink less (caffeinated beverages and alcohol), and get more organized. Well, Tim Harford, the author of Messy, would like to talk you out of that last one. And if Benjamin Franklin were alive, he would probably tell you about how unsuccessful he was at being organized. Tim Harford is the author of several really amazing books, The Undercover Economist, The Undercover Economist Strikes Back, Adapt, and The Logic of Life. He also writes a regular column for the Financial Times and is a radio commentator on BBC Radio 4 and hosts the program More or Less. The Wizard, the mathematician, and the dilapidated building Creativity seems elusive and transient; a trait that is possessed by a few mad geniuses who are elevated above the rest. Harford shares the in-depth experiences of some of the most widely recognized creative thinkers from across various industries. From the production of David Bowie’s Lodger album, to the immense and generous intellect of mathematician Paul Erdos, and the stories from the intellectual giants in MIT’s legendary Building 20, through honest analysis of their experiences Harford provides his readers with valuable insights into the creative process. Cover art – Lodger by David Bowie, EMI RecordsHarford sets a bleak scene for his readers, Bowie had come to the end of his creative rope. His marriage was failing and he was experiencing legal troubles. He was a mess. Enter the wizard with some weird advice. That is not Brian Eno’s nickname, but Hatford informs his readers that he “once dressed like a wizard”. Eno created a deck of cards that he referred to as “oblique strategies”. He would draw a card and people acted on the instructions. The twist here is that the directions were apropos of nothing, “twist the spine”, “water”, and “change instrument roles” are just a few examples. Paul Erdos was a mathematician best known as “the most prolific collaborator in the history of science”. The picture Harford paints for his readers is of an itinerate, amphetamine addicted genius with a vast number of acquaintances. He did not own a home – preferring instead to stay as an incredibly demanding houseguest with other mathematicians. However, “he made connections no one else could” and this often meant breakthroughs across the disciplines of mathematics as he shared information across fields. Not Building 20 – just the main campus building for MITMIT’s Building 20 was a complete disaster at the time of its destruction. It had housed everything from offices to a radiation lab to anechoic chambers. Noam Chomsky, Bose, hacker culture, and arcade games were all borne in this building. Administrators did not care about the building, it was always meant to be demolished, one project even removed several floors to ensure that their project would fit inside. That was the world’s first marketable atomic clock. Amongst the various stories of disorganization, adverse conditions, and absolute chaos that are the crucibles of creativity and innovation are stories of people. Actual people, like the man who won the Loebner Prize for the “Most Human Human” at the annual Turing Test in 2009. It is an astounding story of robots, interrupted conversations, and hacking OkCupid. You will have to read it to find out the rest. Lessons Learned © Jazmin Quaynor (Unsplash.com)What Hartford ultimately concludes is that we need to be open to possibility, no matter how messy. “We’ve seen, again and again, that creativity, excitement, and humanity lie in the messy parts of life, not the tidy ones”, and that includes how much you get accomplished with respect to email, whether or not you actually use documents, or whether your room is just fine (and not a complete pig sty – like your mother was always fond of saying). Harford manages to blend hard scientific research and solid historical fact with an amusing flair. The book itself is roughly broken into broad themes with stories that intertwine and interrupt each other, much like the course of a conversation. Harford will convince you to embrace the inherent “messiness” of life and cross that resolution off your New Year’s list.","January 11, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Blog-Image-Guide-messy-600x400.jpg"

Hence I propose approaching the whole thing methodically like a real strategist would. Meaning, doing your research i.e. getting to know yourself first to know what habits are going to work for you and which you should forget. I have already written on the Impact Hub blog about types of habit personalities developed by Gretchen Rubin so have a look and put your finger on the kind of character you have. Make 2017 your year of discovery – find out what motivates you, what dampens your energy, what scares you and what drives you forward. 2. Take time off from hustling *at this stage some hurry away scared and recommence hustling*. I saw multi-tasking being praised for a valuable skill and years later being condemned as the new smoking. Yeah, it’s hard to catch up. ‘Wilson showed that the cognitive losses from multitasking are even greater than the cognitive losses from pot smoking. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning information while multitasking causes the new information to go to the wrong part of the brain. If students study and watch TV at the same time, for example, the information from their schoolwork goes into the striatum, a region specialized for storing new procedures and skills, not facts and ideas. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes into the hippocampus, where it is organized and categorized in a variety of ways, making it easier to retrieve it.’ Daniel Levitin, The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload Currently, everybody is about hustling. Gary Vaynerchuk made hustling a synonym of his name. Guides and books explaining how to become a professional hustler pop up like mushrooms after a downpour. Everything well-known entrepreneurs said in the past is translated to the modern version of being a hard worker: ‘they know how to hustle’. You know what? As much as I love being busy, I wouldn’t be as productive as I am, without taking time off. I do not mean a ten minutes break or actually sitting down at a table without screens to have a meal. I mean having a cut-off time in the evening when you won’t touch your mobile and computer anymore. Weekends off work. Having an hour in the morning just for your pleasures. If you are working hard, and I bet you are, you will get what you are after without self-inflicted exhaustion anyway. 3. Find mentors Not just one- find as many as you can. Do not get lured into thinking that you know everything because there will always be somebody, who has a little bit more knowledge, experience or insight. Identify your weaknesses, seek people who inspire you and follow their lead. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. 4. Be mindful of your achievements Whether it means patting yourself on the back for sending that e-mail or practising gratefulness in the evening, take the time to appreciate what you have done and set yourself on track towards empathetic life. That alone is one of the most powerful tools to rewire your brain. Change your thoughts, and you change your world, wrote Norman Vincent Peale. 5. Learn to say no Remember the movie ‘Yes Man’? Jim Carrey plays a frustrated guy, who turns his life around with one powerful world: yes. However, as fantastic as his transformation was, the real world is not as kind to self-employed, start up workers and entrepreneurs as the Holywood would like it to be. Sometimes, you got to evaluate, weigh pros and cons and not take that crazy opportunity, which makes people’s jaws drop when they hear about it. Sometimes, you have to say no because chasing stars can break your contact with earth and leave you hanging when you least expect it. Know your goals, know your worth, and choose what brings you closer to your dreams. Want to stay in touch and get more inspiring content from Impact Hub Vienna?

Andreas hat bei einem Unfall im Alter von fünf Jahren seinen linken Arm verloren. Von den Paralympics 2016 in Rio hat er eine Bronzemedaille mitgebracht. Eine passende Ergänzung zu seiner umfangreichen Medaillensammlung von Europa- und Weltmeisterschaften. Nach der Matura hat Andreas ein Wirtschaftsstudium begonnen. „Ich bin mittlerweile im 13. Semester und habe inzwischen 7 ECTS, also immerhin mehr ECTS als ich Finger habe, somit passt das“, sagt Andreas. Außerdem ist er Moderator des ORF Behindertensport-Magazins „Ohne Grenzen“. Wie bist du eigentlich zum Schwimmen gekommen? Ich habe nach dem Unfall in der REHA verschiedenste Sportarten ausgeübt, um den Körper aktiv zu halten, die Muskulatur aufzubauen und die Wirbelsäule zu kräftigen. Gerade im Wachstum ist es besonders wichtig, in Bewegung zu bleiben. Schwimmen war ein großer Teil davon, weil das Element Wasser so spezifisch und speziell ist, dass man sich, obwohl man an Land Mobilitätseinbußen hätte, im Wasser frei und selbständig bewegen kann. Das macht Wasser so faszinierend für viele Menschen, die nach einem Unfall in ihrer Mobilität eingeschränkt sind. Ich hab ein, zwei Jahre lang einmal in der Woche Schwimmtraining gemacht und das dann auf zweimal die Woche gesteigert und so ist das Schritt für Schritt weitergegangen. Ich hab nie daran gedacht, dass das einmal Leistungssport werden wird bzw. dass ich jemals Profischwimmer werde und vom Sport leben kann. Aber es war schon immer eine Liebe da zum Sport? Das Wasser hat mich fasziniert. Ich konnte vor dem Unfall nicht schwimmen, war zwar im Wasser, aber mit Hilfsmitteln und eher ängstlich. Somit hab ich keine Vergleichswerte, wie das ist, sich mit zwei Armen im Wasser fortzubewegen. Nach dem Unfall bin ich einfach durchs Wasser geschwommen, das hat Spaß gemacht und es hat Dinge gegeben, die ich an Land nicht machen konnte, aber im Wasser war das alles wurscht. Ich konnte untertauchen, ich konnte mich von unten hochstoßen, ich konnte mich von der Wand wegstoßen, Tauchen war also sehr lustig. Die anderen REHA-Patienten haben mich immer Fisch genannt. Was ist für dich das Faszinierende am Sport bzw. am Leistungssport? Mich fasziniert es, mir Ziele zu setzen und die Schritte dahin zu planen. Und dann natürlich, es nicht beim Denken und Planen zu belassen, sondern die Dinge auch wirklich zu machen. Und es gibt nichts Schöneres, als wenn man dann seine Ziele erreicht bzw. sogar übertrifft, und man weiß, dass man das durch harte Arbeit erreicht hat. Es war anstrengend, es war mühsam, aber es hat sich ausgezahlt, weil man das, was man sich vorher vorgenommen hat, geschafft hat, obwohl die Startvoraussetzungen nicht optimal waren oder sind. In meinem Fall eben das Fehlen des linken Armes. Und wenn ich sehe, dass ich mein Ziel erreicht habe, kann ich mir neue Ziele setzen, kann neue Projekte angehen. Das fasziniert mich am Sport. Foto: Michael SchatzmannSchwimmen erfordert ein extrem hartes Training. Wie schaffst du es, dich immer wieder aufs Neue zu motivieren? Oh, ja, es ist enorm hart. Es ist vieles immer dasselbe. Irgendwo hin und wieder zurück zu schwimmen. Ich hatte aber im Prinzip nie ein großes Motivationsproblem. Ich weiß, warum ich es mache, ich weiß, was mein großes Ziel ist, ich weiß, wo ich hinmöchte und ich weiß, dass ich ohne das harte, umfangreiche Training dort nicht hinkomme. Und ich glaube, diese intrinsische Motivation, dass ich es für mich selbst macht, ist sehr wichtig. Wenn ich es nur für die anderen, also Menschen die ich begeistern oder überzeugen möchte, oder aus finanziellen Gründen machen würde, hätte ich wahrscheinlich schon vor Ewigkeiten aufgehört. Wenn es mal nicht so klappt mit der Motivation, gibt es da jemanden, der dich aufbaut oder gibt es eine Technik, ein Buch, irgendetwas, wo du sagst, das baut mich auf, das bringt mich wieder vorwärts? Wenn es nicht so läuft, muss man sich die Frage stellen, wofür man es macht. Ich hatte auch schon Jahre, in denen ich meine Ziele nicht erreicht habe, wo es nicht so geklappt hat, wie ich es mir erwartet hatte. 2014 hatte ich einen Hänger. Genau zwischen zwei Olympiaden. Der Körper ist müde und man weiß, man hat noch zwei Jahre Training vor sich. Und da muss man sich immer wieder vor Augen führen, warum man das Ganze macht, einen langen Atem haben und weitermachen. Für mich ist dann auch mein Glaube eine große Bestärkung und er hilft mir, dass ich nicht emotional sofort irgendwelche Entscheidungen treffe und alles hinschmeiße. Wie fühlt sich eigentlich so eine Medaille an? Sie ist schwer. Und die Paralympics-Medaillen sind mit einem halben Kilo besonders schwer. Das ist ziemlich heftig, da braucht man schon eine starke Nackenmuskulatur. Das kann ja für einen Schwimmer kein Problem sein. Es ist etwas ganz Besonderes. Es ist das Höchste, was man erreichen kann, am Podium zu stehen, bei den Paralympics. Natürlich ist es ein Ziel, auf der obersten Stufe zu stehen, aber das kommt schon noch. Ich bin so froh, dass ich jetzt, bei meinen dritten paralympischen Spielen, meine erste Medaille holen konnte, das ist eine große Erleichterung. Man steht bei der Siegerehrung und die Medaille wird umgehängt und dieser Moment ist repräsentativ für all den Aufwand, den man in den Jahren davor auf sich genommen hat, damit man eben dieses eine Ziel erreicht. Die Medaille repräsentiert das, wofür man alles getan hat, wofür man hart trainiert hat. Mit den Besten der Welt am Podium zu stehen, das ist unglaublich! Foto: Franz BaldaufWas sind so deine nächsten sportlichen Ziele? Wir sind im Oktober 2017 bei der Weltmeisterschaft. Mein Ziel ist es, unter die Top 3 zu kommen. Und ich weiß, dass ich das Potenzial dazu habe, bei der Weltmeisterschaft und der Europameisterschaft vorne mit zu schwimmen. Es wird sicher schwer. Das Jahr nach den Spielen ist auch immer ein Übergangsjahr, man überlegt, was man sich für die nächsten vier Jahre vornimmt. Mein Ziel ist es, dort eine Silberne oder Goldene zu machen. Dazwischen gibt es sicher auch noch andere Großereignisse, Europa- und Weltmeisterschaften. Das Ziel ist es hier immer, aufs Podium zu schwimmen, mit zu schwimmen, sodass ich zufrieden sein kann mit mir und mit meinem Team und weiß, dass die ganze harte Arbeit nicht umsonst war. Gibt es im Sport für dich irgendwelche Vorbilder? Ich bin generell, aber vor allem im Behindertensport fasziniert, wenn ich die Geschichten der Sportler lese. Ich habe absolute Hochachtung vor jedem, der sich für die Parlympischen Spiele qualifiziert und es fällt mir wirklich schwer, da jemanden herauszupicken. Daniel Dias ist ein Schwimmer aus Brasilien, der mich absolut fasziniert oder Jessica Long, eine Amerikanerin in meinem Alter. Sie hat, glaube ich, schon über zwanzig Medaillen bei den Paralympics gewonnen. Sie hat schon ziemlich früh angefangen und war mit Zwölf schon Siegerin bei den Paralympics in Athen. Es ist faszinierend zu sehen, was alles möglich ist, wenn man es möchte, wenn man hart dafür arbeitet und die gesamte Bewegung begeistert mich. Was Para-Sportler weltweit in ihren Communities erreichen, mit dem was sie tun, ist unglaublich und gehört viel, viel mehr in die Welt hinausgetragen. Und abgesehen vom Sport, was treibt dich im Leben an? Ich möchte Dinge bewegen, ich möchte Menschen begeistern, ich möchte Menschen erreichen, das habe ich mir als Ziel gesetzt. Vor allem in den Bereichen, mit denen ich tagtäglich konfrontiert bin, Behinderung, Barrierefreiheit, Barrieren abbauen im Umgang mit Menschen mit Behinderung, das sind die Dinge, wo ich sehe, dass wir in unserer Gesellschaft noch viel tun müssen. Das ist das, was mich antreibt, was mich motiviert, die Dinge so zu tun, wie ich sie tue. Weil ich eine Message transportieren möchte, dass alles möglich ist, wenn man daran glaubt und wenn man etwas dafür tut. Und dass man sich nicht unterkriegen lassen muss, vollkommen egal, was einem fehlt. Das ist das, was ich in meinem Leben erkannt habe und das möchte ich auch anderen zeigen. Du bist leidenschaftlicher Sportler und seit einiger Zeit im ORF auch als Moderator eines Behindertensportmagazins tätig. Und das auch mit viel Leidenschaft. Was ist so besonders am Moderieren oder an diesem Job? Das Moderieren fasziniert mich. Man hat die Möglichkeit, in einem bestimmten Rahmen, ob bei einer Veranstaltung oder Fernsehsendung, Liveshow oder im Radio, dem Zuschauer oder dem Publikum, eine Message zu transportieren. Und wenn man richtig und gut kommuniziert, kann man es schaffen, dass etwas beim Zuhörer, beim Publikum ankommt, und das ist es, was mich fasziniert und was wir bei „Ohne Grenzen“, dem Behindertensportmagazin, versuchen, nämlich zu zeigen, dass wir in Österreich eine Behindertensportszene haben, die total aktiv ist, die lebendig ist. Und dass der Behindertensport etwas Bewegendes ist, dass er etwas Aktives ist, kein „Naja, lass ma einfach einmal die paar Behinderten dort herumtun und sich Bälle zuwerfen und nennen wir es halt Sport“, sondern teilweise wirklich beinhart, zielorientiert, und dass da Menschen dabei sind, die unglaubliche Geschichten haben. Und wir wollen zeigen, dass eine Behinderung zu haben nichts Schlimmes ist. Es ist nichts, wofür man sich selbst bemitleiden muss, und es ist auch nichts, wofür man irgendwie Mitleid von Anderen braucht. Sondern es gehört einfach dazu. Man hat es. Es ist ein Umstand, mit dem man sowieso leben muss. Und man kann genauso gut das Beste daraus machen. Und der Sport ist einfach ein Mittel, um zu zeigen, dass das Leben nicht aufhört, nur, weil man eine Behinderung hat, warum auch immer. Deine Sendung hilft auch, weil du das sehr sympathisch machst. Sie ist nicht anklagend, die Sendung. Ich glaube, dass der Behindertensport allein schon dadurch an Stellung gewinnt, oder? Das ist natürlich das Ziel, das wollen wir. Wir wollen uns auch nicht nur auf die Behinderung fokussieren. Was ich auch jetzt in der Berichterstattung rund um die Paralympics immer wieder beobachte und analysiere ist, dass nur noch über die Behinderung und die Auswirkung einer Behinderung, nicht mehr über den Menschen berichtet wird. Und das ist das, was mich stört, dieses Reduziert-Werden auf etwas, das mir fehlt, oder auf etwas, das ich nicht kann. Ich verleugne meine Behinderung ja nicht, daher kann man gerne auch über meine Behinderung berichten, wenn man über mich berichtet, aber man darf den Menschen nicht vergessen, man darf nicht die Geschichte vergessen, man darf nicht die Dinge vergessen, die der Mensch tut. Und wenn man sich nur auf die Behinderung fokussiert, gibt man dem Menschen nicht den Wert, den er verdient. Und hier sehe ich international bei der Berichterstattung über die Paralympics einen enormen Unterschied zu unserer heimischen Berichterstattung. Obwohl sich auch hier schon einiges getan hat. Ich bin total happy, wenn ich die Paralympics Peking und Paralympics London vergleiche. Aber natürlich muss noch viel verbessert werden und da versuche ich, durch unser Magazin Vorreiter zu sein und zu zeigen, dass es funktioniert, mit Respekt und mit Wertigkeit über den Behindertensport zu berichten. Wird es mit dem Sport irgendwann einmal vorbei sein oder hast du vor zu schwimmen bis du 100 wirst? Oder wohin treibt es dich dann? So lange werde ich sicher nicht schwimmen. Ich bin noch jung und kann sicher noch bei ein oder zwei Paralympics schwimmen. Aber ich werde so ehrlich mit mir selbst sein, dass ich aufhöre, wenn die Leistung nicht mehr passt. Ich war nie untätig und habe mir ein bisschen was aufgebaut. Also wenn ich jetzt in die Zukunft denke, dann kann ich mir schon vorstellen, dass ich im Bereich Kommunikation bleibe. Als Moderator oder Sportjournalist. Moderieren, auch andere Sendungen, wie z.B. Licht ins Dunkel, ist ein absolut genialer Job. Ich finde es faszinierend, im Studio zu stehen und gemeinsam mit anderen Moderatoren so eine Sendung zu führen. Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass ich langfristig in dem Bereich bleibe. Und sonst ergeben sich sicher enorm viele Dinge, auch in Richtung Marketing oder Kommunikation für den Behindertensport. Da bin ich sehr, sehr offen und flexibel und versteife mich auch nicht auf eine bestimmte Richtung. Es macht mir einfach Spaß, in der Szene tätig zu sein. Also, wer weiß. Gibt es Themen außerhalb von Sport und Journalismus, die dich bewegen, die dich interessieren oder vielleicht sogar mehr bewegen als interessieren? Ich bin ein großer Fan der Tech-Szene, aber das hat jetzt nicht unbedingt was mit dem Sportlichen zu tun. Mich fasziniert die Start-up-Bewegung, die wir in Österreich gerade erleben. Weil Start-ups denselben Prinzipien folgen, wie wir im Sport. Man ist auf sich alleingestellt, man hat keine großartigen Ressourcen und Mittel zur Verfügung, um die Welt zu verändern. Aber man tut es trotzdem, man setzt sich hin, man macht einen Plan, schaut was man tun muss und dann tut man es einfach. Das Tun ist etwas, mit dem ich mich identifizieren kann in der ganzen Start-Up-Bewegung und es fasziniert mich total. Ich interessiere mich und sauge alles auf, was sich in Österreich, aber auch international, z.B. in den USA, in diesem Bereich tut. Sonst gibt es auch noch einige Themen, die mir am Herzen liegen, wie z.B. Barrierefreiheit, Wahrnehmung und Akzeptanz von Menschen mit Behinderung und Chancengleichheit für Menschen mit Behinderung. Dass man, vollkommen egal, welche Behinderung man hat, ob einem jetzt ein Arm fehlt oder ob man querschnittgelähmt oder blind ist, trotzdem die gleichen Chancen hat, sich in dieser Gesellschaft zu verwirklichen, ein selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen und einfach sein Leben zu leben. Und da glaube ich, dass wir auch noch viel zu tun haben. Und in dem Bereich möchte ich mit dem, was ich tue, eine Vorreiterrolle einnehmen. Und könntest du dir vorstellen, selbst ein Start-up im Tech-Bereich zu gründen? Ja, sicher. Also wenn mir eine Idee kommt oder wenn sich irgendetwas auftut, dann kann ich mir das auf jeden Fall vorstellen. Ich bin halt leider kein Coder, das habe ich verabsäumt in der Ausbildung. Aber mein Bruder kann sehr gut programmieren, also brauch ich nur eine Idee … Eine andere Frage. Hast du irgendeinen besonderen Wunsch im Leben? Das ist schwierig. Damit setzt man sich im Alltag gar nicht so auseinander … Also, ich hab meine Ziele, die ich mir setze. Dass ich weiter hart arbeite, dass ich bei den Paralympics in Tokio so weit wie möglich vorne stehen kann, im Brustschwimmen und am besten auch noch im 100-Meter-Schmetterling, also auch in meiner Nebenlage. Dass ich mich breit entwickle, dass ich nicht stagniere und nicht aufhöre zu wachsen. Also, das wäre so mein persönliches Ziel. Und dass ich damit Dinge verändern, Menschen erreichen und bewegen kann. Und ich würde mir wünschen, dass ich mit all dem, was ich tue, Möglichkeiten für die, die nach mir kommen, schaffen kann. Dass ich dafür sorgen kann, dass andere die Probleme, die ich hatte, ob jetzt im Alltag oder im Sport oder in der Ausbildung, nicht mehr haben. Also das ist ein bisschen meine Vision. Fühlst du dich in Österreich als Behindertensportler ausreichend unterstützt und anerkannt? Ich bin ganz zufrieden mit der Entwicklung, mit der Tendenz. Es schaut gut aus. Die verschiedensten Institutionen tun immer mehr für die Gleichberechtigung. Das heißt, wenn man nicht behinderte olympische Sportler und Paralympics-Sportler miteinander vergleicht, sieht man, dass die Sportler fast schon gleichwertig gefördert werden. Ich sage jetzt bewusst nicht „fast schon gleich gefördert“, sondern „fast schon gleichwertig gefördert“, weil ich glaube, dass Förderungen nicht beim Geld aufhören, sondern auch damit zu tun haben, wie man mit den Menschen selbst umgeht, wie man kommuniziert. Da hat sich in den letzten Jahren sehr, sehr viel getan, vor allem auch von Seiten des Sportministeriums und der Sporthilfe. Das heißt, man hat geschaut, dass man nicht nur gleich fördert, sondern auch gleich kommuniziert, auf Augenhöhe kommuniziert. Und das ist einfach so wichtig. Das würde z.B. heißen, dass man zu Veranstaltungen nicht nur zehn olympische Sportler, sondern auch zehn paralympische Sportler einlädt, einfach um zu zeigen, dass man wirklich nicht mehr zwischen Para und Olympia differenziert. Und das muss auch das Ziel sein, in der langfristigen Kommunikation. Ich glaube, dass wir in diesem Bereich in Österreich schon gute Fortschritte gemacht haben, aber es ist sicher noch viel zu tun, auch deshalb, weil viele Menschen den Behindertensport noch immer mit Mitleidssport gleichsetzen. Diese Vorurteile sind in der Bevölkerung noch da, und da muss man schauen, dass mehr gezeigt wird vom Behindertensport, dass mehr gezeigt wird von den Menschen, die den Sport betreiben, weil die Geschichten bewegen, weil sie Menschen erreichen können. Aber das Ziel soll nicht Mitleid sein, damit man an Charity-Geld kommt, sondern zu zeigen, der ist zwar querschnittgelähmt, aber im Prinzip ist das vollkommen wurscht, er hat einen Traum und er lebt ihn. Oder in meinem Fall, dem fehlt halt ein Arm, aber das ist vollkommen egal, er kann trotzdem als Moderator vor der Kamera stehen und die Welt bereisen und seinen Traum leben. Denn Mitleid bringt keinem etwas. Hast du Tipps für unsere Leser? Für ein Buch, Musik oder irgendeinen inspirierenden Ort? Möchtest du unseren Lesern irgendetwas mitgeben? Also ich lese derzeit extrem viel. Hänge an den Büchern von Gary Vaynerchuk zu den Social Media Strategien. Weil er zeigt, dass durch die Plattformen, die wir derzeit zur Verfügung haben, die Kommunikation nicht mehr einseitig ist, sondern eine two-way-communication sein muss, und das fasziniert mich total, weil ich versuche, das auch im Sport anzuwenden. Also, wer derzeit gerade ein gutes Buch sucht, dem kann ich „The Thank You Economy“ empfehlen. Sonst: Ich höre unheimlich gerne „Praise and Worship“-Musik, vor meinen Vorträgen. Singe auch sehr gerne. Also wer Musiktipps braucht, meine Playlist auf Spotify ist öffentlich, da kann ich gerne den Link schicken. Da gibt es über 2.000 Titel an guter Musik, die Playlist kann ich insgesamt als Tipp abgeben. ","January 17, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/header-3-600x400.jpg"
"93","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/19/5-ways-volunteering-can-land-you-your-next-dream-job/","ImpactHub","5 ways volunteering can land you your next dream job","The chase after the job of your dream is restless and competitive. No wonder! The stakes are high but the requisites even higher. You want to daze your future employer with your employability skills, character and who-you-knows but your current work history is not there yet. Have you stopped for a second to think that there is a simple and social impact friendly way to do it right within your reach? One word: volunteering. Go ahead and read these five very good reasons you should be looking out for volunteering opportunities asap. 1. It always looks good on the résumé People tend to appreciate others who volunteer and think positively about them, that’s true. After all, you contribute your time to do good for others. However, social contributions aside, employers just really like proactive and experienced people full stop. “Does It Pay to Volunteer?”, a study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, concluded that unemployed people who volunteered between 20 and 99 hours during the year were roughly 7% more likely to have found employment one year later compared to those who didn’t volunteer at all. Another US government study by Corporation for National and Community Service clearly stated of all the 70,000 jobless people they tracked between 2002 and 2012, those who volunteered had a 27% better chance of finding a job than those who didn’t. Not to mention volunteering makes you look trustworthy and points out that you are a giving person. When you apply for a job, having a “volunteered at…” section gives your personality a huge plus point, which sometimes may ootweigh the professional experience. 2. You don’t know who you might meet Maybe the love of your life? No, seriously. During volunteering you get to know new people who volunteer for (perhaps) similar reasons as you. It’s a great way to make new friends and get in touch with people you otherwise would have never had the opportunity to meet. Here at Impact Hub, we have a bunch of amazing volunteers, who found like-minded people and went ahead to set up start-ups together, collaborated or were offered a job opportunity. 3. Networking When you volunteer in a place which is in your field, you effortlessly create great networking opportunities. You gain access to decision-makers in a non-work environment. You may not get money for your contribution, but contacts are worth their weight in gold. Especially when volunteering in a place relevant to your dream profession. Making a good impression and standing out with solid work ethics might just get you noticed. 4. You test existing/learn new skill set You might be a Photoshop pro, but unless you have a solid reference and a project in your portfolio, your CV skills section is not as promising to a potential employer. This is why volunteering can become the key testing field for your skills – you will pick up on what you do well and what you have to improve. Not to mention learning a completely new skill set. Quoting after Youth Central, ‘there are eight skills that employers want you to have, no matter what industry you’re working in: communication, teamwork, problem solving, initiative and enterprise, planning and organising, self-management, learning, technology’. Yes, you got it: the majority of them are developed in a work environment. A lot of companies look for volunteers and treat them exactly the same as team members and, let’s be honest, in some places becoming a volunteer is generally much easier than getting a job. 5. A great start when you’re new in town When moving to a new place it’s not always easy to find your way and meet people. Community gives you strength to persevere but what if you haven’t found it yet? Volunteering gives you the opportunity to “do something” while adjusting to your new location, be needed and appreciated, and in general, it’s the best place to meet your future friends. Sitting at home won’t get you your dream job but volunteering sure can! If you are interested in becoming a volunteer in Vienna the why not volunteer with us!

"94","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/24/stress/","ImpactHub","Stress! What can you do about it?","Stress is a part of our lives. It’s definitely a part of mine. It can be frequent and unavoidable. Whether it’s internal or external stress, it can happen in all sorts of different situations and sometimes it overwhelms us. I think everyone has felt this at some point in their lives. You get to a point where it’s all a bit too much to handle. Stress happens when we interpret a situation as a threat that will have a poor outcome. Maybe we’re overworked and experiencing burnout, or we’re under-challenged and experiencing boreout. Yes, that’s a thing. We can be so bored that it causes stress. All of this is what’s called distress or “bad stress.” But is stress always negative? It certainly feels that way. The answer is no. There’s something called good stress. What is good stress? Eustress, or “good stress” motivates us and allows us to perform in a stressful situation because we see it as a positive challenge instead of as a threat. Maybe it’s the nerves before an important presentation or a meeting with a potential investor. We can succumb to the pressure we’re putting on ourselves (bad) or we can allow it to energize us to perform well (good). We can be defeated by stress or let it inspire us. By framing a situation the right way, we can change how it affects us for the better. Remember, stress is caused by our reaction to a situation, not the situation itself. How do I manage chronic stress? Many people have difficulty managing stress and for some, it becomes chronic. Chronic stress can have a bad effect on our overall health. Sleeping difficulties, frequent headaches, and a higher likelihood of getting sick are just some of the side effects. The situations that trigger stress are different for everyone. A stressor for one person can have no effect on another. We are all unique and that’s why we need to take the time to understand ourselves and how certain situations affect us so that we can find personal solutions. As a start, we should all try to make sure that we regularly step away from work and go do activities that reduce stress. Take a walk or do a breathing exercise. It’s all about finding balance. Activity suggestions If you are looking for certain activities to relieve stress, the important thing to remember is that you need to find what’s right for you. Here are some suggestions: Yoga Visualization Meditation Autogenic Training Sensory deprivation tank Massage Exercise Reiki To keep up to date on upcoming events (like a calming and relaxing yoga class at the Hub), and other Impact Hub activities, subscribe to our newsletter, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram.","January 24, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blog_stressed2-600x400.jpg"
"95","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/01/26/grit-gets-it-done-a-review-of-grit-by-angela-duckworth/","ImpactHub","Grit gets it done: A Review of Grit by Angela Duckworth","Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance is a powerful study of success and achievement. With the final message that it is not our innate talent that moves us forward but our “grittiness”. Available on amazon.deAs it is still January and those New Year’s resolutions are still in our notebooks, on refrigerators, and on office bulletin boards we thought we would review a book on staying power. Angela Duckworth’s Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance is an in-depth study of success and achievement. It turns out that natural aptitude is not the answer. Angela Duckworth is an eminent psychologist focusing on the psychology of success. She has snagged degrees from Harvard, Oxford, and the University of Pennsylvania. While she has published papers in many academic journals, this is her first book. She has taught mathematics at the secondary school level, worked for McKinsey (a management consulting firm that prides itself on only hiring the best and brightest), won a MacArthur grant, and now is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and has founded the Character Lab. You don’t have to be a genius The book is partially a memoir and partially an academic treatise. The very first anecdote in the book is in the Preface and it is her father telling her and her siblings that they are not geniuses. This seems rather harsh, they are, after all, children. Given her impressive credentials and career it would seem that she is indeed some sort of prodigy. And this assumption is what forms the basis of her argument. Yes, she was smart but it was not intelligence that got her where she is today. Scripps National Spelling Bee – spelling bee contestantsWhat makes a spelling bee champion a winner or a Westpoint hopeful a graduate? The first several chapters of the book introduce the readers to Duckworth’s concept of grit. She makes a statement early on in the book; “our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another”. Duckworth takes time to develop her arguments that showing up and working at skills is how people become successful. “Effort counts twice” is a refrain throughout the book and with two short word equations she makes her point eloquently; “talent x effort = skill and skill x effort = achievement”. You need to be gritty While you do not have to be a genius to read or understand Duckworth’s message you do need a certain measure of grit to make it through the book. Duckworth keeps returning to the same handful of people for anecdotes; herself, her children, the school children she Coffee for twotaught, olympic swimmers, spelling bee hopefuls, and the list goes on for a another few examples but the stories lack variety. The main body of the book, chapters six through nine, where she explains the four principles involved in grit have no pacing and move slowly. Additionally, the chapters outlining practice and purpose are a restating of the pop psychology book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink, published in 2009 (which appears in the suggested further reading section of the book). The book progresses slowly to a guide for parenting children for grit and for creating workplace and learning cultures that foster gritty attitudes. One of Duckworth’s concluding thoughts is that this is her “way of taking you out for coffee” and explaining what she knows. However, this is a very long coffee with a very verbose professor. While the message is amazing the delivery does not engage the reader.","January 26, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/grit-passion-and-perseverance-600x400.jpg"

Hannes zählt im deutschsprachigen Raum zu den zentralen Vordenkern für nachhaltiges Entrepreneurship. Und noch eins, Hannes ist Vorstandsvorsitzender der Akademischen Sektion Wien des Alpenvereins. Mit SCHUMBETA vernetzt Hannes seit 2007 Familienunternehmen mit innovativen Köpfen aus Technologie, Kreativwirtschaft und Forschung – um Wissensaustausch, Kooperationen und gemeinsame Projekte zu provozieren. Was treibt Dich an? Eine unendliche Neugier die ich schon als kleiner Steirerbub hatte, die Lust komplexe Dinge verstehen und gestalten zu können und die Freude am Manifestieren von Ideen. Und: Guter Filterkaffee. Wann hast Du die Leidenschaft für Entrepreneurship entdeckt? Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser gegeben? Ich kam in meiner Schulzeit durch Zufall in ein US-amerikanisches Programm zur Förderung von Entrepreneurship – Junior Achievement – bei dem Schüler echte Minifirmen gründeten. Ich gewann damals mit meinem Team den abschließenden Österreich Wettbewerb und traf deswegen in Moskau andere Europagewinner und in Chicago die besten aus 90 Staaten der Welt. Das hat mich damals energetisiert und nachhaltig aus meinem sozialen Milieu geschossen (wo niemand UnternehmerIn war) und es war klar, dass es nur dieser Weg sein kann. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Den Wichtigsten. Unternehmerisches Denken und Handeln sehe ich als Basis für eine Gesellschaft, die vor vielen Herausforderungen steht und deswegen neue Lösungen entwickeln und umsetzen muss. Bei deinen Projekten, Initiativen versuchst du immer Nachhaltigkeit mit Entrepreneurship zu verbinden. Was liegt diesem Gedanken zu Grunde? Entrepreneurship ist von zentraler Bedeutung für die Gesellschaft – WENN – es auf nachhaltigen Werten jenseits von plumper Gier gründet. Auf der börsennotierten Konzernebene, wie auch auf der Venture Capital finanzierten Startup Szene dreht sich alles primär um den Shareholder Value. Das ist nichts Böses, aber es ist keine Blaupause für eine global vernetzte und regionale verankerte Wirtschaft, die den Menschen – und nicht nur wenigen – dient. Trotzdem bin ich überzeugt, dass es den / die InhaberIn braucht, um Innovation gegen Widerstände, mit Risiko und überdurchschnittlichen Investment von Zeit und Energie, durchzusetzen und Unternehmen aufzubauen. Du bist ein ganz besonders neugieriger Typ und auch immer offen für Veränderungen, Spinnereien. Was reizt Dich so sehr an Veränderung? Es ist wohl weniger die Veränderung, sondern mehr die Herausforderung und Freude des Gestaltens. Der Status Quo langweilt mich rasch. Für mich steht immer die Praxis der Zukunft im Fokus und wie wir Systeme verbessern können. Woher nimmst Du die Kraft für Deine Umtriebigkeit? Von den Bergen. Deshalb habe ich mich 2013 auch dazu entschieden, mein Basislager in Innsbruck aufzuschlagen – auch wenn ich natürlich die Kreativität und Diversität von Metropolen liebe. Die unmittelbare Nähe zur Bergnatur und den Luxus auch vor dem Büro am Berg Sport machen zu können, ist für mich unschlagbar und Kraftquelle. Was beschäftigt Dich derzeit am meisten? Die Herausforderung, Schumbeta für die Expansion in andere Städte vorzubereiten (aktuell Wien & Innsbruck) und zu einem Inkubator von unternehmerischen Projekten und Kooperationen auszubauen, die etwas besser machen. Wir müssen mehr Wirkung erzielen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es Dich nicht geben würde? Ein treuer Bahnkunde und Weintrinker *lacht* Was treibt Dich an immer wieder neue Projekt zu starten? Die Qual des Phantasievollen sind die unendlichen Möglichkeiten. Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Ich habe mir den Raum immer selbst geschaffen. Auch eine Triebfeder für meine Projekte. Schumbeta entstand genau aus diesem Grund – weil ich 2007 keine Szene fand, wo Unternehmertum, Nachhaltigkeit und Innovation interdisziplinär vernetzt wurde. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf die angebliche Sicherheit eines 8-5 Jobs, der heute auch schon oft ein schlecht bezahlter All-in Vertrag ist. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Freiheit von strukturellen Zwängen. Das öffnet viele Möglichkeiten für eine andere Art von Leben, das in meinen Augen viel näher an der Natur des Menschen ist und eben nicht zwischen der bösen Arbeit und der Freizeit eine radikale Trennlinie zieht. #worklifebalance Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Meine Geschäftspartnerin Nicole Arnitz ist bereits 10 Jahre lang meine Gefährtin und inzwischen Teil der Familie. Mentoren hatte ich nie wirklich, bleibt aber ein Ziel für das neue Jahr. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Eine fordernde Bergtour auf einen Gipfel. Da gewinnt man Abstand zu den kleinen und größeren Schwierigkeiten des Lebens und gewinnt Demut und Erhabenheit zurück. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Selbstverständlich. 2017 wird vieles ausgerollt, an dem wir die letzten 2 Jahre gearbeitet haben. Schumbeta wie auch Mehrblick werden im 10 Jahr in eine neue Phase eintreten, auf die wir uns sehr freuen. Mehr kann man auf Facebook oder im Newsletter erfahren <U+0001F609> Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Leidenschaft zu begeistern? Offen über Ideen, Motive und Ziele sprechen. Schumbeta ist ja nicht nur eine Anlehnung an „Josef Schumpeter“, sondern auch an den Begriff der „Beta Version“, den Webdienste geprägt haben, als sie quasi mit unfertigen Prototypen in die Öffentlichkeit gingen. Ein Prinzip, dass wir viel stärker leben sollten. Die Angst vor Ideendiebstahlt ist zu 99% unbegründet. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Manche wundern sich, mit was ich mein Geld verdiene *lacht*. Meine Kundenprojekte mit Mehrblick waren aber bis heute auch wenig präsent. Auch das wird sich 2017 ändern. Meine Familie liest inzwischen fleißig auf Facebook und in meinem Blog mit, was ich so treibe und feuert mit digital an Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ja – den Umgang mit der Zeit und dem Medienkonsum kritisch zu hinterfragen und schädliche Routinen zu eliminieren. Zu lesen in meinem aktuellen Artikel “2017 – kann – grandios werden.” Hast Du einen Wunsch? Das die Massenmedien ihre Negativspirale durchbrechen (oder wir sie stärker ignorieren) und die Gesellschaft ihren Optimismus und die Freude am Fortschritt wiederfindet. Wenn wir in Angst und Pessimismus gelähmt sind, wird es für die politische und gesellschaftliche Entwicklung gefährlich. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen einen Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Weniger Facebook – mehr Medium.com, oder / und wieder Bücher in die Hand zu nehmen, wie zum Beispiel „Die Kunst ein kreatives Leben zu führen“. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Ambros Gasser von ASI Reisen wäre ein interessanter Gesprächspartner. ","January 31, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hannes-offenbacher-600x400.png"

While the applications are running until the 19th of February, we decided to reach out to two 2016 program winners to check in with them and ask them about their experience. Meet Bert and DmHmT (Design meets Handcraft meets Technology). What is RE:WIEN? RE:WIEN supports start-ups/ventures that develop new solutions and try to create a positive impact on society (social/environmental impact). In an intense 6 months process, RE:WIEN works with ventures to develop their ideas further, establish smart and resource-efficient processes and build strong and sustainable businesses operating on the market. More info here. Bert – March 2016 Winner Bert is sold and advertised as a roof brand for craftsmen, furniture and furnishings, which are designed as small series. Through Autumn and Spring campaigns on specific topics (for example, seats), new products and manufacturers are being presented, which are then included in the range of the webshop and redistributed. We spoke to Ingmar Fuhrich, one of the Bert team members. What inspired you to set up your venture? After over 15 years of building furniture, I thought that it’s the time to step into the spotlight and advertise my work. But why stand alone when so many of my colleagues also do great work and struggle to increase their popularity reach? Why not bundle resources, products, ideas and strengthen the community? So the idea for the hub „BERT arge möbel“ was born! What made you apply to RE:WIEN? We consulted Christine Spernbauer from Impact Hub (https://vienna.impacthub.net/about-us/team/) regarding our project. She recommended Re:Wien, which appeared to be custom. What was the most valuable part of RE:WIEN for you? Getting feedback from experts, helped us to focus on the relevant parts of our venture. How did your business change thanks to the program? Our „baby“ became somehow more of an adult <U+0001F609> What advice do you have for the future program participants? Ask precisely what the program is all about and then make as much use of the support as you can get! Would you do the program again? I would immediately do the program again <U+0001F642> RE:WIEN Final Event 2016, 14th November Photo by Iza Hegedus. See the photoalbum here. DmHmT – March 2016 Winner DmHmT (Design meets Handcraft meets Technology) curates and designs tailor-made furniture and accessories that combine the possibilities of digital production and high-quality Viennese craftsmanship. Customers are encountered as pro-sumers, which means that the interaction with them is pro-active in order to create tailor-made solutions. We spoke to Juan Sebastián Gómez, the person behind the venture. What inspired you to set up your venture? The wish to contradict the notion that automatization will take jobs out. I saw the opportunity in mixing two opposite technologies as a message. On the other hand, re-interpreting the concept of Viennese Handcraft and placing it far beyond its glorious but gone past. What made you apply to RE:WIEN? I was looking for the way to turn the idea into a business. I lack business knowledge; putting things on paper and imagining is rather what I can do, but structuring things and creating a business is a different task. But beyond that I recognized in the program a certain support for idealism, and I believe structuring ideas as business, is what turns them into reality. What was the most valuable part of RE:WIEN for you? The direct contact and counsel by the experts. How did your business change thanks to the program? The idea got a structure of its own. However, that is no recipe for success. The business failed but proving you might be wrong or right is a part of starting something up. I neither regret starting my venture, nor having dedicated hours and neurons to the program and idea. The knowledge remains and I did knew I was risking something. Totally worth it! What advice do you have for the future program participants? Remain open minded. You can have your doubts as well, but it’s important to risk and keep doing things. If you do believe things can be better structured through the program, go ahead and do it. Now, do not expect the job to appear done by magic. The program is not even a milestone, just a guide. Would you do the program again? Yes, however I would like it to be a bit more intense. Versions: English | German You want to apply for RE:WIEN 2017?

It was a little bit shocking to see Austria not flinging itself into the confetti-powered spiral of Valentine’s Day offers and gifts, the same way England or Poland do. At the same time, you cannot help associating Valentine’s with what you see in the American movies what with the characters always being subjected to constant indoctrination persuasion of TV, radio, print, online commercials, stores transformed into red caves and POS traps screaming the need to profess undying love with raspberry body scrub, chocolates and stuffed bears. This is what Valentine’s are right now – a commercial festival, which justifies price increases by sticking hearts onto the products or adding ‘Love’ and ‘romantic’ in the copy. Inner Grump has been fed so now onto the actual topic of this post – making the celebration of love an impactful event with this socially conscious guide to Valentine’s! Throw away Recycle your stale ideas of what this occasion ‘should’ look like and join us in turning this festival of love into the festival of socially impactful love. First of All: Give Consumption a Break “I don’t need no Valentine’s Day to tell me hat I have to express my love for someone”, grumbled someone somewhere. And while in the past that person would be christened the lost sibling of the Grinch, today we would nod in agreement and go refill our reusable glass bottle with tap water. We buy too many clothes, which we don’t care about – more than 30 % of clothes in Europeans’ wardrobes have not been used for at least a year, says ECAP Summary Report 2019. In 2019, for the first time ever, we consumed 100 billion tons of new materials. According to a new research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (PNAS), “decarbonizing fast enough to stabilize the climate rests on all of us changing how we think and act – and doing it fast“. Because it is so easy to go to a store and buy something, in February 2020, we should challenge ourselves not to. Think of it as your Valentine’s gift to our planet <U+0001F30E> Fair Flowers Do you know that developing countries such as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya, Malaysia and Costa Rica are increasingly gaining bigger floriculture market share, especially in the international cut flowers export? The low-cost imported flowers sold at florists, supermarket or freshmarkets are tempting to consumers with low disposable income but little does the public know about the conditions flower farm workers have to endure to satisfy the global demand for a romantic bunch of roses. You are probably wondering why buying local is such an important element of living a conscious live. It’s about lowering your carbon footprint and not supporting companies, which ship containers of chilled cut flowers across the ocean at small cost, putting regional farms at a disadvantage. It’s making sure, you do not support companies, which pay trifling salary to whole families working in greenhouses. Local florist market in Austria isn’t exactly blooming, but what you can make sure to do is: buy organic flowers. Buying organic means: GM-free plants, treated only with natural fertilizers and farmed in conditions saving at least <U+2153> of CO2 compared to the conventional cultivation. Organic certificates also mean the producers have to comply with the EU regulations regarding fair pay. When buying flowers in Austria, look out for these labels. Sing Your Way to Someone’s Heart* Alina, one of our Hubbers, suggested people should revive serenading to bring back the romance. And why not?! We are all about gender equality so we encourage both men and women to start practicing their vocal skills. Alternatively, get a boombox. I would never leave you hanging like this, John. Source. *We cannot be held responsible for serenading yourself into troubles with the police by breaking the ‘no past 10 pm noise nuisances rule’. Give a Valentine I do not mean an actual card (although DIY Valentine’s cards are pretty cool, see below) but a symbolic gesture to celebrate the love we should show to another human being every other day of the year. Make a deal with yourself to be especially nice to the people you encounter on this day. Spread the love by saying ‘Good morning’ to your quiet neighbor and asking them how they are doing. Leave the extra change to an Augustin seller or be extra polite and patient when the morning rush at your regular coffee place is keeping you waiting longer for your caffeine fix. Invite your colleague to go out to lunch with you or text your dad wishing him a good day. It’s not words but actions that matter on days like this. DIY Recycled Gifts All the crafty creatives unite! Use recycled materials to make meaningful presents, which will always be much better than any shop bought trinket. Refresh your hardcore art skills perfected during the primary school years, when the teachers forced the whole class to decorate paper hearts with glitter and repurpose available materials. Wait…Was it just me and the rest of Polish kids that were tortured this way? OKAY. Make a playlist of your favourite love songs (remember those mixtapes?) and load it onto that USB you had lying about since 2009. Write a list of 100 reasons you love your partner on individual pieces of paper, throw in some sentimental content (the cinema and gig tickets you have been hoarding, or your photos) and pack everything into a jar – now your chosen one can fish out your love notes, whenever they feel like it. Write a poem, even if you have had 0 experience with writing poems. There’s first time for everything. Make a collage from newspaper and magazine scraps representing all the things your partner loves. Frame it and voila. Make a Valentine’s card (no drawing skills required)! Source. Gift Memories, not Things The best gifts are those our loved ones can treasure forever in their memory. The experiences do not have to be expensive – it’s about spending time together after all. Go to one of the beautiful Viennese parks and gardens for a long relaxing walk. Travel to the furthest parts of the city and explore the unexplored, for example, Steinhofgründe. Book a Shades Tour, open your mind and support local community. Have a dinner in the dark at Dialog im Dunkel. Feel like Charlie at the chocolate factory and visit Zotter Schokoladen Manufaktur. Do something from the Green Guide to Vienna list. Host a Valentine’s Day Party Who said the Feast of Saint Valentine’s should be a private affair? Gather a group of friends, be it singles or couples or mixed, and throw a love themed potluck dinner. Make it even more sustainable by applying no waste rule – all dishes have to be made from scratch and preferably with produce that otherwise would have been never bought and left on the shelf in your local supermarket. Alone. Unloved. Abandoned. #isthisguilttrippingworkingyet You could also organize a romantic comedy movie screening with a group of friends.

Harold and Maude Silver Linings Playbook Someone Great Call Me by Your Name Gift Vegan Cookie Dough Balls Because everybody deserves these round chunks of heaven. Add a romantic spin by rolling them in chopped dried raspberries. Ingredients: 1 cup almond flour 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil 2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips Instructions In a large bowl, stir together the almond flour, coconut (if using larger shredded coconut pulse in a food processor first until finely ground) and salt. Drizzle syrup, vanilla, and coconut oil on top. Stir in until a dough forms. Stir in chocolate chips. If your dough is too dry to come together, stir in a teaspoon of water. Roll dough into tablespoon sized balls and place in a baking dish or food storage container. Store in the refrigerator. This recipe comes from here. I hope these tips for making Valentine’s Day impactful will come in handy. Remember: you could go crazy spending money on things but in the long run they won’t matter – gift time, your attention and your kindness which are the most valuable currencies in the world.

"99","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/02/10/erbeerwoche-is-tackling-taboos/","ImpactHub","Erdbeerwoche is Tackling Taboos","We have said it before, but it is worth saying again: At Impact Hub Vienna we do not shy away from any conversation and neither do our ventures. So we are going to have an interesting conversation about a taboo subject, and we are just going to put it out there right now – this is definitely an article about feminine hygiene products. Actually, even saying it that way still makes it more awkward than just being frank and open, this is really going to be about the products that women use while on their periods. Meet two women who decided that taboos about menstruation needed to be trashed. Introducing Erdbeerwoche! Erdbeerwoche FoundersErdbeerwoche is a company that was founded by Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger, who had worked as consultants in the sustainability sector. They noticed something odd – in all the conversations about sustainability the feminine hygiene sector was excluded. Annemarie and Bettina decided to fill the gap. So what does Erdbeerwoche do exactly? And that is an excellent question. They are the first company in the German speaking world to provide awareness and education regarding the choices and alternatives for feminine hygiene products. They also have a handy online store, where after reading the information on their site, you can choose to purchase any number of environmentally friendly and healthy for you alternatives to your current products for all your menstruation needs. Did you know …. “Even though menstruation happens to nearly every girl and woman every single month, people do not talk about it. This is why many women (and men!) are not aware of the social, environmental and health impacts of this taboo,” Bettina states. “Every year, 45 billion conventional hygiene products pollute our planet. The problem: 90% of tampons and pads consist of a cellulose plastic mix and that is why one single tampon takes up to 500 years to biodegrade,” Bettina continued. Watch ‘Breaking the bloody taboo’ by Annemarie Harant & Bettina Steinbrugger at TEDxDonauinsel While the statistics are staggering this is not just an environmental issue but it is also a personal health issue. Recent studies have found harmful substances in standard feminine hygiene products which have been linked to abnormal tissue growth in the abdomen and reproductive organs, abnormal cell growth throughout the body, immune system suppression, hormonal and endocrine system disruption, according to an EPA draft report. “This is just one of the many reasons why it is so important to educate women and girls about menstruation and feminine hygiene.” Helping Hands at the Hub We try to provide our ventures with help and support through many innovative scaling and accelerator programs. Erdbeerwoche took advantage of the Investment Ready Program in 2016, as well as our scaling program. We sat down to chat with them about their experiences in the program. “The IRP was especially was helpful for us because we had many valuable bilateral coaching sessions with experts, starting from finance to sales and marketing. We also learned how to prepare the perfect pitch.” Annemarie and Bettina say that the three most valuable things they learned in the IRP was how to create a convincing pitch, how to find the “blind spots” and challenge their thinking, and how to ensure financial arrangements were well structured and attractive to investors. In terms of financial support “we received funding from AWS for a jumpstart – which helped to scale our venture. And additional funding for Kreativwirtschaftsscheck – to implement innovative elements in our on-line shop to improve the customer experience.” The best advice is to “inform yourself as early as you can about potential funding and get as much help as you can – Impact Hub Vienna is a great spot for that.” What is AWS? AWS stands for Austria Wirtschaftsservice and it supports incubators and accelerators as well as incubated start-ups. The aim of the collaboration between IRP and AWS is to strengthen and expand the program, resulting in a higher annual volume of investment ready start-ups and international expansion. But wait there is more …. What does the future hold for Erdbeerwoche? “We will continue with our mission to break the bloody taboo and revolutionize the feminine hygiene market until all 2 billion menstruating women in the world do not feel ashamed about their period and have access to sustainable feminine hygiene products.” It is an ambitious mission and one that we have supported from infancy through programs at Impact Hub Vienna. Are you ready to take your product or service to the next level – just like Erdbeerwoche? The Investment Ready Program is currently looking for ventures.

"100","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/02/15/austrian-social-venture-bridges-the-multicultural-gap/","ImpactHub","Austrian social venture bridges the multicultural gap"," The limits of my language mean the limits of my world, read the words of an Austrian-British philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein. Even though what he meant was that philosophy (the world) ends when the language cannot venture further, we can’t help but think that in today’s world the growing language gap creates tall impenetrable walls between the multitude of cultures coexisting in a country. The fact is, we need to talk to make our world a better place for everybody. interprAID, a social venture offering virtual community interpreting services, is set on making the dialogue happen. Founded in 2015, interprAID is the first ever online community interpreting platform enabling NGOs to find qualified interpreters in over 40 languages. The beauty of this social start up is its accessibility – the only tools you need after registering on the platform and connecting with a community interpreter is a laptop with a solid Internet connection and a webcam. With the recent influx of refugees and asylum seekers, the EU governments were faced with a completely new array of social issues. The basic human need to understand and be understood to perform not only required legal tasks, but also function in a society, became a challenge to those, who did not know the language of their new country. Even though in many countries the newcomers gained access to local language courses, the need for fluent speakers of Arabic including local Syrian dialects was burning because in many cases refugees did not speak English. Some statistics for Austria… Last year the Austrian BM.I (Bundesministerium für Inneres) registered 42,073 total asylum applications (source) of which 27,254 were admitted to the procedure post-screening. With the total number of immigrants living in Austria steadily growing year on year (settling on 14.6% in 2016, source: Statista) the need for interconnecting people is bigger than ever. However you want to look at it, we live in a multicultural reality. We contacted Matthias Monreal, the person behind interprAID and a member of Impact Hub Vienna, to ask him about his idea, what he thought of being at Impact Hub Vienna and what his plans for the future are. Where does the idea of interprAID come from? Matthias: My wife, who works within the Social/Non-profit sector lamented the fact that she could not find adequate interpreters to communicate with her clients. They were hard to find, expensive and lacked the necessary cultural competence. With interprAID we address exactly these three needs. We build a virtual pool of interpreters online, accessible via video call; we follow a marketplace approach to serve as many user organisations as possible; and we focus on the best possible match between client and interpreter by going beyond mere language selection, but including cultural, religious, ethnic and personal criteria that might be decisive for a situation of trust in which an assignment can take place in the first place. Why do you think providing community interpreting services is so important right now? Community interpreting has been around since a long while. Less so in the German speaking world, but e.g. in the UK it is well established. What has been lacking so far is proper market access for community interpreters who were so far always limited by local demand, which you can imagine isn’t that much if the language you offer is Tigrinya or Pashto. Through interprAID community interpreters have a chance to actually generate an income and thereby have an incentive to professionalise. Community interpreting is the facilitator across the entire social sector. Without it, a large group of people will be excluded from essential services our society offers. The recent refugee crisis has highlighted that and created more public awareness for language barriers, but the problem is not new in principle. Community Interpreting enables those who do not sufficiently speak the official national language to access services they need. It reduces inequality and helps to provide equal access – a basic human right. Community Interpreting is frequently needed in medical, educational, housing, social security and legal settings. It forms the basis for professional service delivery. (Source: interprAID ) What programs did you enroll in at Impact Hub Vienna? I am part of the Accelerator Programme, through the found! Deloitte program (link) and the IRP Lab. What did you think of the help you received at Impact Hub? The Impact Hub is a great environment and I wish I could soak up more of the spirit by actually being there. Since I am based in Innsbruck it’s more sporadic for me. I have attended several workshops and received mentoring and expert advice, all of which was very good. What are the three key findings from your participation in Impact Hub hosted programs? The power of the network. Don’t build you venture in a bubble, but share, talk about it, inspire and you will receive a lot of valuable input! What sort of support did you receive from AWS (Austria Wirtschaftsservice)? I have received funding through the JumpStart program and just found out today [3rd Feb 2017] that we won funding through the AWS Social Business Call. Great! In general, what is your advice for any start up owner, who is using Impact Hub and AWS services? Talk about your idea, involve others as much as possible. Where do you see interprAID going? Our vision is a world in which language and cultural barriers do no longer exclude people from receiving social services. interprAID is as much a practical tech solution to make this possible, as it will be a community for community interpreting. We want to build awareness and promote change in how we deal with language barriers and intercultural communication in our society. We need to trigger a mind-shift that changes practices and policies of how social services are provided to people who do not speak our language. We see a great need for that and great potential to generate fundamental impact at a large scale.","February 15, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/interpraid-banner-600x400.png"
"101","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/02/22/plan-do-check-read-business-books/","ImpactHub","Plan, Do, Check, Read … Business Books","Being a social entrepreneur necessarily means that you find yourself on the cutting edge of business. You are doing something new to fill the void that you have spotted. Whether it is an innovative service or a gap filling product – you are trying to make a difference. However, you, as the vanguard, will run up against questions to which you do not have the answer. Fortunately, there is a platform that offers all the answers you need. Books. And in the words of Penny Arcade – they already interface well with the shelves that you have at home. Hundreds of business books are on the market. There are also hundreds of books lists on the internet that give you the 67 best business books across a range of options (okay, there was no list with 67 that we could find – but there definitely was a 73 best books for entrepreneurs). We sat down with internet search engines pushed to the max to find consensus on what the best books for social entrepreneurs might be. Turns out that no one really agrees on “the best”. So that meant that we needed to do some reading of our own. Here are our picks … Getting Beyond Better by Roger Martin and Sally Osberg This is a guide for any person looking to create a socially focused business. The book outlines the key stages for development of a social business: understanding the world, envisioning the future, building a model for change, and scaling the solution. Case studies and personal examples provide first time change-makers and experienced visionaries with inspiration and tips to move forward with their ideas. Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant While not focused solely on social entrepreneurship – the book ranges over businesses like Apple and Disney- this title provides some valuable insights on creative thinking. The book starts out with a discussion about going against the grain and the risks one takes to do things differently. With chapters covering overcoming anxiety and ambivalence, creative thought, effective collaborations, and impactful actions this is a resource for anyone thinking outside the box. Of particular note is a young entrepreneur whose marketing strategy is to outline the reasons not to invest in his start-ups. Platform Revolution by Geoffrey G. Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne, and Sangeet Paul Choudary Case studies form the basis of this book, from Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Tinder, and SkillShare, are all examined as successful platforms that revolutionized their individual markets. Digital networks are the mainstream and we need to understand how to profit from their ubiquitousness as social entrepreneurs. This book is the ultimate guide to understanding the titans of these networking platforms and to harnessing the tools for our own businesses. Sprint: How to Solve Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz The guide is based around the five day process that designer Jake Knapp (also the author of the book) developed at Google to bring new ideas to testing within five days. With social entrepreneurs being pulled in many directions it is imperative to learn where to focus your time and learn how to get answers fast. One of the many answers that seems that the answer will take the longest is product testing. Not according to this book – you can get answers in days allowing you to better your market position and product. This is an essential guide for any social entrepreneur with a gap filling product. Not every story has a happy ending … However, every happy ending is accompanied by a cautionary tale – also because we all learn from failure we are proposing this next book. Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons Dan Lyons, a successful journalist at Newsweek, suddenly finds himself without a job. And so he decided to work within the start-up industry. With a memorable cast of characters and nerf gun fights, Lyons spins a tale of a start up venture, flush with new venture capital, that spirals out of control. While this is not the story we want for ourselves, it serves as a “Don’t Do What Jimmy Don’t Does”, to quote the Simpsons. And we all need to relax sometimes … Did you know that reading fiction makes us more empathetic people? Well, it is true. According to a recent article published in Scientific American, reading fiction improves our ability to relate to others by getting us to imagine a different perspective. That means we can better anticipate the needs of our market by reading. We just wanted to give you a really good, business related excuse to read these two books, one is even a graphic novel. Monsieur Linh and His Child by Philippe Claudel A poignant portrait of what it means to be a refugee, even though it is from a different crisis in a different time, there are many parallels that can be drawn in our modern world. The overarching theme of the book is friendship and creating a dialogue between disparate cultures. Monsieur Linh finds an unlikely friend in Monsieur Bark, as all that they have in common is their individual understanding of grief and loss. This book comes highly recommended by the UNHCR. Strong Female Protagonist Book One by Brennan Lee Mulligan (Author) and Molly Ostertag (Artist) A former teen super hero is shown evidence of a far reaching conspiracy. She abandons fighting giant monsters with her super powered team mates to go to college in order to make a bigger difference. Brought to market through a kickstarter campaign it is a complete collection of the webcomic of the same name. Mulligan and Ostertag have real world experience as entrepreneurs and to trying to make a difference in the world.

You will be productive.","We, people of the Land of Passion Driven, know that we cannot afford to slow down. Your time is now. You got to hustle and bustle, give it your 101% and look i-woke-up-like-this fabulous. You should also work less and preferably four days a week, spend time on passion projects and meditate to be a successful business person. With all the contradicting advice we settle on chasing the dream 24/7 and say ‘I can’t, I am too busy’ proudly when somebody asks us out for lunch. We think we need a six-figure salary to start taking vacations. Even sleep becomes a matter of choice, rather than necessity. This is how many of us board the train headed to station Burnout Central calling at Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Doubt. Instead of making an impact, we sabotage our performance. In this article, we are letting you in on the secrets of a happy and fulfilled life as a successful entrepreneur supported by scientific data and research. Hint: it has a lot to do with taking it easy. Sleep more Sleep is an often underestimated life function by those, who have more to gain by staying up. Or have they? Arianna Huffington, the author of the upcoming book The Sleep Revolution, wrote that “We sacrifice sleep in the name of productivity, but ironically our loss of sleep, despite the extra hours we spend at work, adds up to 11 days of lost productivity per year per worker, or about $2,280.” Essentially, you are losing money by not sleeping enough! Moreover, you aren’t suffering from financial losses only by neglecting to sleep – your overall performance decreases too. Daniel Levitin states in his book ‘The Organized Mind‘ that ’sleep is among the most critical factors for peak performance, memory, productivity, immune function, and mood regulation. Even a mild sleep reduction or a departure from a set sleep routine (for example, going to bed late one night, sleeping in the next morning) can produce detrimental effects on cognitive performance for many days afterwards.’ It means that you are doing yourself a disservice if you continue skipping night rest. In fact, you should start adding power naps to your daily routine because ‘even five- or ten-minute “power naps” yield significant cognitive enhancement, improvement in memory, and increased productivity. And the more intellectual the work, the greater the payoff. Naps also allow for the recalibration of our emotional equilibrium—after being exposed to angry and frightening stimuli, a nap can turn around negative emotions and increase happiness.’ (Daniel Levitin, the same book). Action: Start by prioritising your optimal 6-8 hours of sleep per night for 30 days, which is how long it takes to build a habit. This will also force you to be more task-focused during the day but only if you are ruthless with sticking to your resolution. Tip: be extremely ruthless. Get distracted at the right time Are you 100% focused on this article or longingly looking out of the window, listening in on other people’s conversations, thinking about dinner and that pair of shoes you saw yesterday? Mental unavailability at times when you are supposed to be focused can seriously obstruct your work, but not many people know that letting yourself be distracted is an amazingly effective creativity boost. The trick is to be distracted at the right time. Some experts say that people tune things out for good reasons, and that over time boredom becomes a tool for sorting information—an increasingly sensitive spam filter. In various fields including neuroscience and education, research suggests that falling into a numbed trance allows the brain to recast the outside world in ways that can be productive and creative at least as often as they are disruptive (Source). Action: Practice doing nothing and let your mind roam – ironically planned time slots of being distracted freely are much healthier for your brain than directionless thinking during work times. Use apps such as Calm to meditate and focus on your breath. You can also schedule thought dumps couple of times per day – simply write (or record) whatever is on your mind without thinking about it too much. Space out your workload Our brains can maintain focus for 90 to 120 minutes at a time. If you work continuously for three hours straight, you put yourself in danger of fatigue. In Meijman’s view, ‘fatigue’ is a psychophysiological state that is characterized by a low level of energy, high level of irritability and a lack of motivation to exert any further effort (Meijman, T. F., 1991, About fatigue). This basically means you are unconsciously sabotaging your efforts and the quality of your worklife. Fast Company brings up the widely cited study of prodigious violinists by psychologist Anders Ericsson. He found that the top performers all had the same practice characteristics: They practiced in the morning They practiced for three sessions Each sessions was 90 minutes or less There was a break between each session Action: Follow your work periods with 20 minutes of complete reset- get up from your desk, eat lunch outside of your office, do not talk about work. You can set alarms on your phone to remind you when the break should start and end. Learn how to simply be In our society, it’s natural to value people, who excel. It’s an automatic reaction to praise an employee for leaving the office last or admiring those, who buzz from event to event. This causes a dissonance between those who do what comes naturally to them and the people, who haven’t figured out their natural affinities or are forcing themselves to do what they are not cut out for. We are adding extra projects trying to figure ourselves out instead of polishing what we are good at but too scared to pursue. A recently published book by Professor Svend Brinkmann from the Department Communication and Psychology at Aalborg University Denmark opposes the idea that everybody has to be undergoing a soul-searching self-improvement process, which is enforced by cheap self-help books. The end result of believing to be ‘work in progress’ is a constant feeling of unworthiness which drives us to work tirelessly and justify not taking a break ‘because we have to do better than that’. Action: Say no to projects, which you are doing for reasons other than making you happy. These are energy drainers, which require more time and effort to maintain. Realistically, can you outsource/delegate/skip them? Stop checking your phone The heaviest smartphone users click, tap or swipe on their phone 5,427 times a day, with 2,617 times being a daily average (source). This amounts to 145 minutes per day. While not every interaction you have with your phone is needless, plenty people habitually use their phones at work and home, not letting their brains take the needed break to process information. What’s worse, you can literally max out your brain’s capacity to memorise information by overusing technology! ‘When we attempt to stuff more information in the working memory, our capacity for processing information begins to fail’ (source). Not to mention becoming emotionally unstable: Researchers at the University of Sussex in the UK compared the amount of time people spend on multiple devices (such as texting while watching TV) to MRI scans of their brains. They found that high multitaskers had less brain density in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region responsible for empathy as well as cognitive and emotional control. (source) Action: Mute and put away your phone when resting. Use tools like StayFocused to limit visiting social media sites. Use Offtime to create tech-free zones by strategically scheduling automatic airplane modes. Go offline regularly David Solomon, the global co-head of investment banking at Goldman, told James Surowecki in this NYT piece (source) “Today, technology means that we’re all available 24/7. And, because everyone demands instant gratification and instant connectivity, there are no boundaries, no breaks.” While being able to go online almost everywhere is a technological miracle, it brought in disorders such as FOMO or FOBO, anxieties, amplifying your exposure to content you might now want to see all day long. Design a robust internal and external recovery systems ‘Internal recovery refers to the shorter periods of relaxation that take place within the frames of the workday or the work setting (Geurts & Sonnentag,2006; Veldhoven & Sluiter, 2010) in the form of shortscheduled or unscheduled breaks, by shifting attention or changing to other work tasks when the mental or physical resources required for the initial task are temporary depleted or exhausted. External recovery refers to recovery promoting actions that take place off work — e.g. in the free time between the work days,and during weekends, public holidays or vacations’ (source) Action: Plan one day a week when you will go completely offline, no excuses. Catch up on things that make you happy and come back to your workload the next day.

"103","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/07/inspiring-women-at-work-five-best-books-for-women-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Inspiring Women at Work – Five best books for women entrepreneurs","International Women’s Day happened just recently and with that thought in mind we went to our bookshelves. We found some inspiring stories of women in the workplace and women entrepreneurs – actually we found what we think are the five best books for women entrepreneurs. And we included a couple of fiction gems so that you can take some time off. While these are not all business handbooks, obviously, but they are stories of the struggles that women entrepreneurs have faced trying to balance work, family life, societal expectations, health problems, and sometimes, mental illness. These women will inspire you to keep going, or maybe, to start something fresh. From Hollywood comedy writers and internet geeks to philanthropists and mental health campaigners we have everything covered. Reading about these women has certainly reinvigorated our aspirations and work – we suggest that you check them out as well. Start with… Bossypants by Tina Fey While Fey herself is not an entrepreneur, she did have to make it in two male dominated fields – television and comedy. And she made it in a big way. She was Saturday Night Live’s head writer for a long time, as well as head writer for 30 Rock. The introduction to her book gives the only practical advice to women looking to succeed in a male workplace: “no pigtails, no tube tops.” And “some people say ‘never let them see you cry.’ I say if you’re so mad you could cry, then cry. It terrifies everyone.” And our personal favourite “don’t eat diet foods in meetings”. The book is about her childhood and her experiences in the workplace rather than a practical handbook. But her rise to fame is an inspiring story – from the lanky awkward teenager to one of Time magazine’s most influential people – it is hard to put down. Let IT Go: The Memoirs of Dame Stephanie Shirley by Dame Stephaine Shirley In 1962 Shirley created a business – Freelance Programmers. It was wildly successful. And she focused on employing women with dependents in a time when women in the workplace were frowned upon and women’s rights were marginally recognized. She called herself “Steve” to have a greater say in the male dominated business world. Her memoirs are awe inspiring; from her arrival in England as a refugee of WWII, part of the unaccompanied Kindertransport from Germany, to her philanthropic work with Autism. This is worth the read for anyone who has big dreams. Furiously Happy: A funny book about horrible things by Jenny Lawson You may know Lawson by her other name, the Blogess, which is her wildly successful web site. However, she is also the creator of the silver ribbon campaign for those who have survived (or are surviving) mental illness. This book is a look at mental illness in its various forms and introduces her new campaign. You will laugh, cry, and be scared that you identify with much of what she has to say. The tone of the book is manic and frenetic, however, if you can get beyond that you are in for stories about creating amazing memories, work life balance, and a taxidermy raccoon. You are Never Weird on the Internet (Almost): A Memoir by Felicia Day Day is an amazing internet everything. From running successful web series (The Guild), to online book clubs (Vaginal Fantasy), and getting the first internet musical off the ground (Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along-Blog starring Neil Patrick Harris). From her odd childhood and the beginnings of the internet to the entrepreneur that she has become today – Day takes us on one weird journey. While the book is light on practical business advice there is a great deal of real world experience and advice related to handling stress and health issues while creating a global brand, getting doxed during a global scandal, and handling internet trolls. Business as usual We realize that you may want a bit of practical advice if you are just starting out in the entrepreneurial world. And so, we have picked a book that is an inspiring story of a successful woman entrepreneur with some handy tips along the way. #Girlboss by Sophia Amoruso From her inauspicious beginnings selling a stolen book on eBay to her multi-million-dollar fashion empire, Amoruso will have you glued to the page soaking up every piece of advice she has to offer. From “know when to throw punches and when to roll with them” to “dream big but start small”, the book is useful for anyone who is just starting out or looking to scale up. Included in the book are portraits of other successful women that she has met along the way. While her story telling lacks a little luster there is much that can be learned from the Girlboss. Take some time for yourself Many women struggle with work life balance issues. The demands of work often intrude into our personal spaces. This is especially true of entrepreneurs for whom time at work and at home seem to blend seamlessly, and it would seem to be doubly problematic for women. So, take some time off, you know you deserve it, and read one of these fiction gems that we found for you. An Unsuitable Job for a Woman by P.D. James While this one is a trip in the way back machine, in that it was not published within the last five years, it is still valuable to consider. It is a murder mystery novel by one of the masters of the craft. Cordelia Gray is 22 years old and has just been left a less than credible almost insolvent detective agency. With no money and few options – one of them being to go back to her secretarial job – Gray pursues the case that lands on her desk. Through her investigations, Gray confronts gender stereotypes and has to work through many issues related to women in the workplace – especially women pursuing what is classically known as the men’s domain of work. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (Marvel Comics) This book is comic in both senses of the word: it is a comic book and it is quite hilarious. Ryan North and Erica Henderson bring this superheroine to life in an amazing way. Squirrel Girl or Doreen Green, as her alter ego is called, has the proportional strength and speed of a squirrel and some pretty fantastic reasoning powers to boot – although we are not completely sure if those also come from squirrels. She struggles with balancing college life “Because you need an education to help people” and her superhero duties. Often the conflict does not end in violence but Squirrel Girl suggesting another way forward for the villain. This is an excellent read if you want to have a laugh along with a powerful superhero.","March 7, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiring-Women-at-Work-Five-best-books-for-women-entrepreneurs-600x400.png"

Here at Impact Hub Vienna we wanted to celebrate inspiring women at work. So, we chatted with seven women entrepreneurs in our community about what they are doing and their inspiration. The United Nations theme for International Women’s Day this year is Women in the Changing World of Work. The workplace is changing, as we know, because we have all chosen a less traditional route of employment. Most of us within the community are self-employed and a staggering 63% of the community are founders or co-founders. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2016 report “economies with high female labour force participation rates are more resilient, experiencing economic growth slowdowns less often”. And sometimes that means you need to make your own job – and jobs for others. In our community Hanna Shatovich of Hanna in the House Hanna in the House is a style and career coaching service for men and women. Hanna gives talks all around the city about fashion and career, in addition to her individual services. “People inspire me. No matter if I know a person for a long time or get to know new people- I have always been interested in talking with people, how they motivate themselves, what’s really important to them, their stories, their dreams, ups and downs, to listen and talk with different people always inspires me. And fashion, traveling, seeing different places, nature, looking at the sea inspires me. While I am doing sports, while I run I get Inspired, to create something … I am a creative mind, my passion to create is inspired by many things.” Andra Slaats of Younited Cultures Younited Cultures is dedicated to rebranding migration. The colourful scarves that you often see around the Hub are a visible symbol of a positive attitude towards migrants and migration. “A beautiful picture, a moment in someone’s life captured in one photo, an image that says more than words, watching people hold hands, sharing an ice-cream with my husband. All these glimpses capture life as it is. When I take time to savor these moments is when I get most inspired.” Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger of Erdbeerwoche Erdbeerwoche is dedicated to educating women about their options for feminine hygiene products and to building a world where women aren’t ashamed to be on their periods. Their innovative and sustainable product offerings are only part of the story as they provide education on their website as well. “Every day we are inspired by many enthusiastic women (and men!) who immediately wanted to support the mission of Erdbeerwoche or have completely switched to sustainable women’s hygiene products. So far, we have already replaced 1 million conventional feminine hygiene products with sustainable alternatives, which is a huge environmental impact. In a survey among our customers in 2014 we also noticed that nearly 90% of the women questioned positively changed their attitude towards their own body and menstruation by using sustainable hygiene products. We get so much positive feedback from women, so we cannot help but spread our mission of sustainable women’s health to the world.” Klaudia Bachinger of WisR WisR is just getting started but it has lofty goals. The goal of the enterprise is to connect seniors to mentorship opportunities within companies – which allows the young to learn from more experienced individuals and seniors to feel more connected and less isolated after retirement. “I guess what really inspires me is people. Whatever I do, is inspired by the stories and experiences people share with me. I love to ask questions, observe people and listen to whatever somebody chooses to tell me. I soak up every little detail like a sponge. And then, when I am all alone walking in the woods, everything I’ve learnt, every story I’ve heard, every person I’ve met, turns into an idea or a vision. I realized that this is true for all kinds of things, music, drawing, editing, and even for business. I strongly believe that only by understanding people, you will understand how to do sustainable business. That is why I am trying to learn as much as I can from every single person I meet along the way.” Perrine Schober of SHADES TOURS SHADES TOURS is an organization that provides a glimpse into the lives of Vienna’s homeless people. Tours are given by the homeless and provide a valuable job opportunity and social inclusion for someone that is now on the outside. “I guess what inspires me most are the reactions of our customers – how much they are appreciate and are thankful for our tours. At the same time, I see the development of each of our guides, how they make their way back into a brighter and more stable life. And when I see how our cooperation partners (the social institutions) applaud our initiative and are thrilled to see SHADES TOURS’ evolution, then my heart fills up with inspiration and gratitude.” Sophie Thalhammer of Fitico Sportswear Fitico Sportswear is creating fair trade and sustainable active wear for women. So, you can have a conscience, look and feel great while working out. “I am inspired by nature, sunlight, mountains, water, being outside, listening to music, juggling …. I love being active, doing sports, to challenge myself. I love Crossfit workouts. I am inspired by people who live their passion, train hard, work hard, and strive to become better. I care about other people, about human rights, living and fair wages, equality and equal rights. I try to live a sustainable lifestyle. I try to make the world a better place.” Katharina Moser of MOSAIK – European Communication Projects MOSAIK pursues unconventional communications and creative projects to promote awareness of the diversity of Europe. Projects include Come on Over: The Quirky Europe Game, Route 28 which is an interactive event in Vienna showcasing Europe’s Diversity, and Wallpaper for Refugees a graphic learning tool for those refugees new to German language. “My biggest inspiration has always been people. Some of my closest friends, whose most personal developments I was allowed to witness, as well as people whose lives I might follow on Facebook while they don’t even know me. I get inspired by those who dare to face others with empathy, no matter the differences in their opinions. By people who think in solutions rather than problems and see myriads of colours between black and white. By those who touch our feelings, might it be through an idea they work for or a spontaneous compliment they give. In the end, it’s all about the people who touch our lives and the ones whose lives we are privileged to touch ourselves.” The global community As we said above – women’s active participation in the economy makes for healthier countries overall. Better and more equal participation in the labour force also drives political enfranchisement. Women across the world are engaging in entrepreneurship opportunities as they strive to create jobs for themselves and better their communities. What can we do to help other women, especially in the third world? The answer is easier than you think. We found two charities that are helping women start businesses and get education W.E. Can Lead and Women for Women International. So, this International Women’s Day lend a hand and as Women for Women International says, “Support a Sister”.","March 8, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiring-Women-at-Work-Our-Own-Community-600x400.png"
"105","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/09/start-ups-use-design-thinking/","ImpactHub","Start-ups use design thinking at an early stage, but how does the journey goes on?","During the journey from defining the initial problem up to the scaling of a start-up, different approaches and tools are helpful. The “Problem to Growth & Scale Framework” combines different approaches that build on each other. The steps are especially useful for the entrepreneur, who is at the beginning of his journey and has identified a real problem that needs to be solved. The framework comprises six important steps on the way to a scaling company: Step 1: Design Thinking Step 2: Research Step 3: Co-Creation Step 4: Lean Start-up Step 5: Business Design & Agile Product- and Customer Development Step 6: Scale What is important in step 1 “Design Thinking”? Start with Design Thinking. Identify your potential users, customers and stakeholders. Recognize the true customer needs and find elegant and simple solutions. Determine a first vision of the value proposition for the potential users and customers. Use Systems Thinking and Data Analytics to understand complex issues and to gain deeper insights. How can “research” support getting market and customer figures (Should this not be “data”?) in step 2? Understand the problem and the situation holistically. Use market research and other analytical approaches to quantitatively assess the problem and the situation. Validate and supplement your findings. Why “Co-Creation” (step 3) benefits each phase? Integrate additional customers and users as well as lead users in your process. Get as much help as necessary from the outside. Search for further solutions and even more radical ideas. Work together across departmental and company boundaries. Develop first MVPs and build trust with partners and customers. How “Lean Start-up” (step 4) supports the efficient development of your offering? Use the Lean start-up approach to develop your offer with little capital. Structure the solution step by step. Due to the fast iterations the product and the business model are steadily improved and validated. Clarify the biggest uncertainties with experiments first. Why “business design and agile product and customer development” (step 5) are central for the product / market fit? In the following, the focus shifts from problem solving and finding the solution (problem / solution-fit) to the elaboration of the right business model by means of business design (product / market fit). The product and the business model are developed in an agile way. Methods such as SCRUM are helpful. Think in variants in the development of the business models. Consider service aspects (servitization) or concepts like Circular Economy (or Cradle to Cradle). What skills are required for Step 6 “Scale”? Growth is only envisaged in the last step is and the business is scaled. The product is introduced into the market. Prepare the organization for growth and scaling. Establish scalable processes, structures and platforms. Check the mind-set & skills in your organization and do not just follow a blueprint. Take the whole organization a step forward and take new ways. The “Problem to Growth & Scale Framework” is one of many methods and tools from the new Design Thinking Playbook. The Playbook (Lewrick, Link, Leifer) is now available in good bookstores and is a must-read for all entrepreneurs and innovators. For more information see the official website of Design Thinking Playbook. Michael Lewrick, Patrick Link and Larry Leifer are always looking for the next big market opportunity. They live Design Thinking in growth areas like digital transformation, and apply agile methods in product, service and business development. They practice the Design Thinking mind-set in the telecommunication industry, at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and at the heart of Silicon Valley at Stanford University. With their help various international companies have developed and commercialized radical innovations. About Michael Lewrick Michael Lewrick holds an MBA and PhD. He did his undergraduate studies New York, Munich and Nice with an emphasis on Business Administration, IT and organizational development.

Manuel hat sich für Agrarwissenschaften an der BOKU entschieden und Florian für Wirtschafts-ingenieurwesen und Maschinenbau an der TU Wien. Beide verbindet eine langjährige Freundschaft und die gemeinsame Leidenschaft für Musik und gutes Essen. Oft haben sie bei gemeinsamen Abendessen über die Herkunft und Produktionsweise verschiedener Lebensmittel diskutiert. Sie haben sich Fragen gestellt. Was kann oder soll man einkaufen und wo? Welchen Einfluss hat man als KonsumentIn? Was kann man selber machen? Und darin sind sich beide einig.– Lebensmittel sollen möglichst regional unter Einhaltung ökologischer und ethischer Aspekte produziert werden.– Der/Die KonsumentIn entscheidet selbst was und wie Produziert wird, durch die erzeugte Nachfrage.– Durch Einkauf direkt beim Produzenten werden diese am besten unterstützt.– Jede/Jeder hat die Möglichkeit, wenn auch nur im kleinen Rahmen, etwas zu bewirken. Hut & Stiel steht für StadtLandwirtschaft, unter Verwendung lokal vorhandener Ressourcen und umweltschonender Prozesse. Kern des Projektes ist die Zucht von Speisepilzen auf Kaffeesud – ein Abfallprodukt mit großem Potenzial. Der Kaffeesud von Wiener Kaffeehäusern, Restaurants, Hotels und Pensionistenheimen wird eingesammelt und in einem Altbaukeller im 20. Bezirk weiterverarbeitet. Die frisch geernteten Pilze werden direkt mit einem Lastenrad ausgeliefert bzw. auf Märkten verkauft. Kurze Transportwege garantieren höchste Qualität und Frische. Am Ende des Prozesses wird das verwendete Pilzsubstrat kompostiert und somit zu Dünger verarbeitet. Dadurch schließt sich der Kreislauf und Abfall wird vermieden. Was treibt Euch an? Unsere Ideale stehen an oberster Stelle unseres Handelns. Wir möchten: • ressourcenschonende Wege gehen und Kreisläufe schließen• gute, gesunde Nahrungsmittel herstellen• zeigen, dass Abfall weit mehr ist als Müll• in den Köpfen der Menschen etwas bewegen und sie motivieren selbst aktiv zu werden Welche Bedeutung haben Lebensmittel für Euch? Lebensmittel sind für uns mehr als ein Füllstoff. Neben Geschmack und Genuss liefern sie uns auch alle wichtigen Nährstoffe. Bewusste Ernährung ist für uns sehr wichtig. Wann habt ihr die Liebe für Pilze entdeckt? Die liebe für Pilze allgemein kam eigentlich erst durch das Projekt. Davor haben wir bis auf die gängigen Pilzsorten (Champignon, Steinpilz, Eierschwammerl, etc.) nicht wirklich viel mit Schwammerl am Hut. Als wir uns näher mit dem Thema befasst haben wurde aber schnell klar was für ein unglaubliches Potenzial in ihnen steckt und wie wichtig sie für das gesamte Ökosystem sind. Sie sind in der Zubereitung vielseitig einsetzbar und wir können auch nach nun fast zwei Jahren immer noch nicht genug von ihnen bekommen. Warum gerade Pilze? Pilze sind in der Lage die Nährstoffe die im Kaffee stecken für ihren Stoffwechsel zu nutzen. Wir können mit ihrer Hilfe ein Abfallprodukt recyceln und damit ein qualitativ hochwertiges und gesundes Lebensmittel regional zu erzeugen. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Lebensmittel in Eurem Leben ein? Einen sehr hohen. Jeder Einkauf ist auch ein Stimmzettel welche Art der Lebensmittelproduktion und des Konsums man haben will. Was verbindet ihr mit gutem Essen? Geschmack, Genuss und im besten Fall auch gute Gesellschaft. Welch Rolle spielt Nachhaltigkeit bei Euch? Nachhaltigkeit ist ein fundamentaler Aspekt in unserem Projekt. Wir versuchen alles was wir tun so nachhaltig wie möglich zu machen. Dabei wollen wir so wenig CO2-Emissionen wie möglich erzeugen, darum liefern wir unsere Pilze mit dem Lastenrad aus. So wenig Ressourcen wie möglich verbrauchen bzw. vorhandene Ressourcen zu nützen und Kreisläufe schließen. In der Natur gibt es keinen Abfall, das machen wir uns zum Vorbild. Wir wollen in der Umsetzung möglichst konsequent sein und alle Bereiche abdecken. Deshalb ist es uns auch wichtig als eine Art soziale Komponente auch Bewusstseinsbildung zu betreiben. Wir bieten Workshops und Führungen an um den Leuten das Thema Pilzzucht näher zu bringen und sie hinsichtlich Resourcenverschwendung, Lebensmittelproduktion und Konsumverhalten zu sensibilisieren. Was war früher da, die Idee mit Pilzen etwas zu machen oder einfach die Liebe zum Unternehmertum? Die Idee ist einem Universitätsübergreifenden Seminar zum Thema Entrepreneurship entsprungen. Also war wohl das Interesse am Unternehmertum zuerst. Allerdings war von Beginn an klar das die Idee entscheidend ist ob das Gründen eines eigenen Unternehmens in Frage kommt. Wo seht Ihr Euch den nächsten Jahren? Gibt´s Expansionspläne? Wir halten gerade unsere Augen nach möglichen neuen Standorten offen. Wir wollen möglichst viel Kaffeesud vor der Entsorgung retten und stoßen dabei mit unserem derzeitigen Standort an die Kapazitätsgrenzen (600kg-Kaffeesatz/Woche). Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Räumliche Gegebenheiten und Lage: Möglichst große Flächen idealerweise in Zentrumsnähe sind schwer zu finden. Es sind aber auch Standorte etwas außerhalb denkbar. Technische Umsetzung: Belüftung, Klimatisierung, Misch- und Abfüllanlagen zur Substratherstellung, innerbetriebliche Logistik, Finanzierung, Erschließen neuer Kaffeequellen und Logistik, … Seid ihr neugierige Menschen? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Ich würde schon sagen, dass wir neugierige sind. Wir interessieren uns für viele verschiedene Themen schauen uns alles an und wollen vieles selbst ausprobieren. Meistens haben wir gleich mehrere Sachen die wir parallel starten. Da ist es sogar manchmal schwierig den Überblick und den Fokus fürs Wesentliche nicht zu verlieren. Was bedeutet Glück für Euch? Puh, das ist wahrscheinlich die schwierigste Frage im ganzen Fragebogen. Wir haben auf jeden Fall Glück eine Arbeit zu haben hinter der wir zu 100% stehen, wo man gerne hingeht und dabei auch noch Zeit mit lieben Menschen verbringen kann. Selbstverwirklichung und wertvolle zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen in einem sozusagen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Zumindest zwei Schwammerl <U+0001F609> Worauf verzichtest Ihr, um Eure Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Hauptsächlich auf Geld und Freizeit. Wir verbringen viel Zeit im Keller und verdienen dabei relativ wenig. Das Privatleben kommt dabei schnell zu kurz. Ist Wien ein guter Boden für Start Ups? Schwer zu sagen. Wir sind ein relativ untypisches Start-up im Bereich Landwirtschaft. Mit unserem Konzept sind wir in vielen Bereichen ein Sonderfall und es ist oft schwierig klare Auskünfte zu speziellen Fragestellungen zu bekommen. Uns war vor Projektstart nicht klar ob wir das überhaupt machen dürfen was wir vorhatten und es gab viele Fragezeichen. Wir haben uns davon aber nicht abschrecken lassen und haben losgelegt, weil wir glauben, dass man immer Lösungen finden kann wie es dann klappt. Was braucht´s an Unterstützung um zu einem echten und vielfältigen Start Up Land zu kommen? In unserem Fall wäre eine Art Wegweiser recht hilfreich gewesen. Wir sind zu verschiedenen Magistraten, Beratungsstellen usw. gelaufen und sind dann meist ohne klare Auskunft weiter verwiesen worden. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Euch ein? Wenn man mit einer Situation unzufrieden ist kann man sie entweder so hinnehmen oder selbst etwas dafür tun damit es besser wird. In unserem Fall war es die Ressourcenverschwendung und die nicht nachhaltige Lebensmittelproduktion die uns gestört haben. Da wir selbst jetzt sozusagen Unternehmensgründer sind hat dem ganzen Thema Entrepreneurship ein wenig den Schrecken genommen. Wenn man von einer Idee überzeugt ist sollte man sich daran wagen sie umzusetzen. Das Risiko damit zu scheitern ist wahrscheinlich nicht so groß wie sich 20-30 Jahre später fragen zu müssen “was wäre, wenn ich mich damals getraut hätte?” Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Die schönste Arbeit ist für mich das Schwammerl ernten. Da sieht man direkt wofür man sich abmüht. Außerdem ist das am Markt stehen bzw. das Ausliefern der Pilze immer eine gute Abwechslung und man bekommt direkt die Wertschätzung für das Produkt zurück. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Unsere Freunde und Familien haben uns während der intensiven Startphase immer unterstützt. Neben moralischen Beistand waren sie auch tatkräftig bei den Renovierungsarbeiten dabei. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Es gibt immer Aufs und Abs. Wir versuchen uns immer so gut es geht gegenseitig aufzumuntern, wenn mal einer nicht gut drauf ist. Unsere Freundschaft ist da sicher kein Nachteil. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Es gibt noch einige Projekte an denen wir gerade intensiv arbeiten. Geheimnisse gibt es bei uns eigentlich nicht. Im Frühjahr werden wir etwa unseren Garten zu einem Pilzgarten machen. Außerdem wollen wir die Pilzzucht für zu Hause ermöglichen und auch unseren Pilz-Kompost anbieten. Langweilig wird es auf jeden Fall nicht. Wohin es genau gehen wird ist jedoch schwer abzuschätzen. Jede Woche ist anders und oft kommt es anders als gedacht. Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Anfangs waren einige eher skeptisch, aber mittlerweile sind eigentlich alle positiv Überrascht was wir in den letzten Jahren zustande gebracht haben. Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Dass das Bewusstsein für Ressourcen und Lebensmittel steigt. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz?

A bunch of ingredients that, when thrown into a pot, cooked and placed on a plate, will right all that is wrong with the world? I wouldn’t prepare anything but that every day, just to give everyone a taste of it; but it would only be really, truly good if everyone had something on their plate. Something nutritious, locally produced, pollutant-free and fair. A goal that is, unfortunately, still far away – yet every little thing we do can help to reach it. This is exactly what the campaign from SDGF wants to draw attention to, calling for a global challenge: #Recipe4Change, a competition for sustainable cooking. How our Recipe4Change happened… Jo and I could not help but be creative and show what “sustainable cooking” means to us – it’s so much more than just consuming cabbage in winter and tomatoes in summer. For us it’s about integration, improvisation, balance, health, fairness and, last but not least, taste! That is why we want to introduce you to a recipe that offers lasting enjoyment on the plate, and to share some tips to help you recreate it at home. We are all aware that our diet affects our health and our bodies -and most of the time, we can feel it too. After all, “you are what you eat” appeals to our body consciousness; but what about the health of the environment, the impact that we do not immediately see? What we eat, how we harvest ingredients and cook them also leaves traces. We are talking about the producers, the transportation routes, the packaging, the energy, the water and the forest. Who tells us: “The world is what you eat.”? “Food should not be a threat to sustainability, but a source of sustainable development.” say the Roca brothers, who have made this ideal the goal of their mission as UNDP goodwill Ambassadors. Part of their campaign is the monthly competition, which entered its third round this January. Photo © Amina StellerChallenge 1. Avoid processed foods Jo and I first met at ImpactHub Vienna and discovered our similar passions quickly. Local ingredients are just as important to us as a balanced diet and gentle preparation. We also try to produce little waste and instead garner as much as possible ourselves. The secret for us lies in reducing everything to the essentials – the real passion in the discovery of other cultures. To use unprocessed ingredients as much as possible is an obvious go-to for both of us, but a rarity nowadays. Look in your local supermarket, you’ll soon discover that fresh food might make up only around 20% of the available produce, if anything at all. Even vegans often fall into the trap of believing that by buying soy sausages they are doing better than they would by purchasing a piece of meat. This is true in terms of animal suffering; but not when taking the cultivation of soy, the rainforest, packaging and transportation into account. When looking at those other aspects, there is not much sustainability left. In addition, processed foods almost always have lesser nutritional values than fresh ingredients. But there are exceptions, which our recipe proves. The idea for the recipe came from Jo, who let herself be inspired by her Korean roots. Adapted to Austrian norms, the recipe looks a tad different. The traditional rice rolls are usually wrapped with nori seaweed leaves, but finely chopped seasonal vegetables are the better choice in this country. The tofu comes from small Viennese producers, handmade and unwrapped instead of packaged. The salad is chosen depending on the season. The cucumbers provide the perfect taste of summer. Only the peppers and the few drops of soy sauce still require further thought. Though this recipe will blow your guests out of the water at the next dinner party, we think the real ingredients for sustainable food are interest, curiosity and openness of people at the table, those who produce the food and the stories behind all of them. We also want to bring awareness to alternatives, options and experiments. As we have already mentioned, tofu does not necessarily have to come from a box- and seaweed doesn’t have to be seaweed. Search for sustainable alternatives that are fun – be curious and trust yourself. PS: I have provided vegan alternatives where needed. Do not be frightened by the many ingredients. Nimble hands can conjure up the work in just one hour. Photo © Amina StellerOur #Recipe4Change – Korean Rice Rolls, Reinvented. Ingredients RICE ROLLS 2 cups short grain white rice 1 carrot 1 cucumber 125g firm tofu 1 egg (egg replacer mixed with chia seeds) 1Tbsp sesame oil 2Tbsp vinegar (apple or rice vinegar) 2Tbsp water 1Tbsp black sesame HEALTHY CHILLI SAUCE 1/2 cup baked almonds 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (nutritional yeast) 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup chili oil Garlic (amount depends on preference) ½ tsp ginger powder ½ tsp peper powder 1 tsp paprika powder 1 red paprika GARNISH 1 bowl of any seasonal salad Red paprika, cubed White radish, cubed Almond flakes 1 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp pumpkin oil Preparation ROLL + Thinly slice the carrot and cucumber, season with pinch of salt and soak up any excess moisture with some kitchen towel. + Bathe the tofu in boiling water for 3-5mins, season with a bit of salt and sesame oil, this will also reduce any unpleasant aroma. Allow the tofu to dry, and then cut it into small sticks. + Whisk the egg and make an egg pancake in a non-stick frying pan, before the egg is fully cooked add a stick of tofu and wrap the egg around it. + Boil the rice, and add sesame oil, black sesame, vinegar and water into the cooked rice. Mix and allow to cool. + When everything is prepared for the rice roll, just roll it! Place a handful of the sliced carrot or cucumber, spread a layer of rice, and place prepared tofu stick and roll. + Place the roll in the fridge to set while you prepare the sauce. SAUCE + Grill the whole paprika until the surface is blackened. + Remove the burned part and cut it in big cubes. + Add all the ingredients for the sauce to the mixer and blend until smooth. FINISHING UP + Cut the cooled roll into bitesize pieces. (Tip! It’s easier if you use a wet knife blade) + Set the sauce on the bottom of the plate and place the rolls. + Add prepared salad on the side. + Prepare the garnish, and add the salad dressing (soy sauce + pumpkin oil). Our tips: Avoid processed ingredients as much as possible: try to use fresh, seasonal ingredients as the basis of your meals and to make use of processed food only in small amounts. Bring color and variety to your plate: Color brings not only happiness, but also healthiness. Basically, the more colorful your food, the more nutritional values it has in most cases. PS. only when talking about a natural color <U+0001F609> Check the ingredients: When buying processed foods, the easiest trick is to see if you understand each term on the list. If so, opt for those products with little additional additives and durability substances. Reduce the amount of salt and sodium: You would not believe all the things salt is in. Salt is fundamentally important for us, but the amounts which are found in processed foods exceed our daily needs by far! Instead, cook more by yourself and try to spice up the meal with spices and rich-flavored vegetables. Boil, grill and steam: These preparation methods will not only save you a lot of fat, but also get more nutrients and taste. They also consume less energy than frying. “Sustainable” cooking cannot only be entertaining as hell and taste incredible, but also brings people and the stories of the day together. Jo and I have learned an incredible amount about each other during cooking and photographing, and we have also learned to share another common trait – smiling in and out of the kitchen!

Barbara Windtner is a filmmaker and dance teacher. Her latest film, “Searching for Isolde“, a dance road-documentary about the search for choreographer and dance pioneer, Isolde Klietmann, is a heartfelt exploration of the life of its subject and a love letter to the art of dance. Barbara is currently developing her next film. We chatted about the Hub, what inspires her, and her love of chocolate. What brought you to the Hub? Barbara: A friend of mine, who does workshops here at the Hub, told me to come and check it out. At the time, I had already spent around two years at home editing “Searching for Isolde” and I was just fed up with my room! I needed to be around people. So I came over to look at the Hub—I immediately liked it and decided to join. Tell me a bit about your childhood. Where are you from? I grew up in Sankt Florian, a small town in Upper Austria with around 6,000 people. The main attractions there are the St. Florian Monastery and my family. We go back generations—my grandparents, my parents, my parents cousins, my cousins—let’s just say that there are quite a few people with my last name! It’s a nice place in the countryside, peaceful, relaxing, and I feel that it was a great place to grow up. My grandmother had a farm so there were always animals around which was a lot of fun for my sisters and I. How did you end up in Vienna? What do you love about the city? I came to Vienna to study Theater and Communications. I’ve always been drawn to larger cities and I really enjoy city life—the culture that’s created in a city with lots of people so I really love Vienna. I also lived in Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador for some time and loved it there as well! It was an important experience that made me realize that although Vienna might be less vibrant than these cities, I’ve learned to appreciate some of the things that we often take for granted like safety and a well functioning public transportation system. And culturally and artistically Vienna is a very enriching city. So I am back! What drew you to filmmaking? As a child, I liked writing—I really wanted to tell stories or be in stories. I also liked taking pictures, composing shots, but it was mostly a hobby. When I was a teenager, my dad gave me a camera and I just filmed everything. In between having fun making James Bond-like short movies, I made a documentary about my friend’s animals. That was my first documentary. And then I kind of forgot about it all for a few years until I saw a couple of TV documentaries that I thought were really well done. At that time, I thought I was going be a radio host because I had spent quite a lot of time doing radio work in Vienna and Upper Austria during the summer holidays. But then I thought about film and just got back into it. I went to Buenos Aires to study it and together with my great film companion Iván Marín from Columbia, we did our first short documentaries. Film is the combination of everything I was ever interested in: words, image, and sound. To me, it’s the most complete art form. What inspires you to tell stories? Curiosity. If I don’t know something, I just want to learn it. This curiosity fuels my projects because I want to discover more about a subject. Right now I’m working on a film about motherhood and family life—things I don’t know very much about from personal experience—but I’m interested because I want to know more. Social issues also light that storytelling fire inside me. I want to shine a light on these issues because it bothers me how certain groups are treated. I’d like to think that if I tackle an important subject through a film, capture the humanity of it, the audience will leave the film and realize that in the end, we’re all one and the same. How was the production of “Searching for Isolde”, your first feature-length film? What difficulties did you have to overcome? The difference between “Searching for Isolde” and my other previous short films was that I made the decision that I wanted to get this film financed and have it shown in cinemas. My short films were often just me, grabbing my own camera and doing it. This time, I thought that I would get some producers on board but they ended up turning the project down because they simply weren’t particularly interested in dance. So I ended up mostly producing it myself anyway together with Ulrike Hager, who had the initial idea for the documentary. That was probably the first stumbling block. Next was the financing. We never got all the money that we needed but I pressed on anyway and kept the production going. We were lucky that a great part of the production took place in Argentina which allowed what little money we had to go further. After filming was completed, I thought things would go a little smoother but then my editor suddenly dropped out of the production. He handed me my 1 Terabyte of footage and left for another job. So I ended up having to edit the movie myself as well which took way longer than I thought it would. Fast forward a couple of years, the movie’s done and then there were distribution issues. I couldn’t find a distributor! Even though we were the opening film of the Crossing Europe Film Festival and got a lot of press, no one was interested. So I ended up taking that on as well. Looking back on it all, there were quite a few difficulties. But when you believe in a project, you just have to keep going. Tell me about what dance means to you and what part does it play in your life? To me, dance is the most basic thing in life—it’s through your body. To move with music, to be in contact with what I consider to be your base and essence, the body, to get in touch with the physical world, to feel rooted to the Earth—dance has had and still has a positive impact in my life. It allows me to center myself and get out of my mind for a bit. I went to a session once with a dance therapist in Brazil and we had to dance one-by-one in front of everyone which can be very embarrassing. Towards the end, he made us all jump together over and over like I’ve never jumped before. I don’t think I’ve ever felt more energy than after that class. The intensity of it was overwhelming but in a good way. Dance can have that power. What are some films that you enjoy? “The Gleaners and I.” A great documentary by Agnès Varda. I love how it’s very much from her personal point of view. I like Woody Allen films, the older ones, like “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan.” I find his neuroses, which I don’t understand at all, very funny. “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” I just think it’s such a beautiful film. What food can you not live without? Chocolate. Any kind. But mostly milk chocolate with hazelnuts! What do you love about the Hub? I love meeting the other members! It seems like every other day I meet someone knew. I love how many of the members are social entrepreneurs looking to make a positive impact in the world and I find that inspiring. What else are you up to? The Shake Off! It’s the biweekly dance sessions that I run here at the Hub. All members are welcome! You absolutely don’t need to know how to dance and most importantly, there’s no wrong way to dance! It’s a lot of fun and the idea is to take a small break from sitting in front of the computer all day, to shake off all your tensions, and to fill your body with real energy instead of that third or fourth coffee. Don’t get me wrong, I love coffee, but I believe that there is a natural energy within ourselves we can activate through some simple movements. Check the events page for the next session!

The sun is shining and the birds are singing. And I feel an uncontrollable urge to clean my apartment. So, it must be spring. This year, I wanted to do things differently. Don’t worry, I still scoured my apartment but it got me thinking … was there a way to clean impactfully? And I do not just mean by using environmentally friendly cleaning products – like vinegar and lemon or eco cleaners. I mean by making lifestyle changes. Although, if for you making an impact is using eco-friendly chemicals then check out Lunzers Mass-Greisslerei. In our latest tradition of providing you with the tool kits to have impactful holidays (because spring cleaning is a kind of holiday, right?) we wanted to give you some tips on how to have an impactful spring clean and the changes that you can make along the way. Shared Spaces I wonder what it looks like when the window isn’t dirty? We share our homes with the people we love. We see them almost every day. Why not make spring cleaning a day to spend with your partner? Cleaning for a whole day sounds like the worst kind of date. However, there with little else to focus on except how much sunlight is not getting through the dirty windows, you can focus on your partner for a day. And at the end of it you can admire what you accomplished together. Breakfast of champions While you have cleaned weekly all winter we both know that you are planning to tackle a lot more with your spring cleaning. And it takes a lot of energy – so why not start out with a hearty breakfast. My partner and I made vegan strawberry oat bars for our spring cleaning adventure – they were delicious and filling. If you can get past the profanity on this vegan cooking site you are in for a real treat with these fruit-filled bars. And who knows, eating more vegan meals might be something that you adopt eventually – because these bars taste really good. A place for everything and everything in its place Getting more organized is something for which we all strive – and some of us are more successful than others. However, organization is not all it’s cracked up to be, according to Tim Harford (and you can catch up on that with this blog post). So you can use this an excuse if you really do not want to clean. However, sometimes it is nice to clear away all the clutter. Sometimes getting organized just means tidying up in a more mindful way (this means remembering where you put things). However, the disorganization of pantries, drawers, and cupboards is enough to drive one crazy (especially, if you are an organization maven). It is hard to create an organized space with different sized packages and boxes that contain sugar, flour, pasta, lentils, and everything else – not to mention terrible for the environment. Fortunately, Lunzers Mass-Greisslerei is here to help you out. Lunzers sells reusable containers for all the bulk food in the shop. You can buy a container, fill it with just the right amount for you, and then take it all home with you. When you return the next time, just bring your containers with you and refill them. It is simple. Suddenly, you have an organized cupboard that also has the added benefit of being better for the environment. Less is more The blue and orange clash – that is why I didn’t want your shirt. As we put away all our winter gear – from the snowboards to the winter jackets – we find ourselves looking at the array of clothing that we may not wear. Some of it is seasonal (we do live in Austria and that means winter) and some of it you are just don’t wear anymore because you are tired of it. And you find yourself wondering what to do with the shirt in your hands that you have not worn for a year. Well, you have a variety of options. You can use the clothing donation bins located conveniently close to the recycling bins in your neighbourhood. You can ask a friend if they want it – but they might not. Or you can come to the next clothing swap at the Impact Hub (and invite your friend who didn’t want your shirt – they might want someone else’s). So, you can refresh your wardrobe by swapping clothing with people here at the hub – get something new to wear and have no change in your ecological footprint while eating snacks and sharing a drink with the hub community. A penny saved Often, as I go through my closets and cupboards, I find things that need repair. My first instinct in the past has been to buy a new thing – whatever it was. However, I find myself repairing things these days. Partially, because I want to figure out how the toaster works but also because I really like that pair of sandals I just took to the shoemaker. Road works are a kind or repair. I am not the only one that has started thinking like this. Sweden is starting to offer tax credits for people who repair rather than buying new. In Vienna, you can take the item to any number of craftspeople who specialise in whatever you need repaired. However, there is a new trend hitting the market – the repair café – and Vienna has one. This innovative concept is where you take or thing that needs repair and you work with someone who is an expert to repair it together. It is a community initiative, hoping to bring people together and to prevent waste at the same time. At the end of the day It seems that you can accomplish a lot more than a clean home when you set about to clean more impactfully. From reducing your ecological footprint, creating more vibrant communities, making new lifestyle choices, and spending more time with your loved ones. It may seem like a chore at the beginning, but the rewards are well worth it in the end (except that I still don’t want to use my kitchen because it took too long to clean).

"110","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/24/8-entrepreneurial-lessons-by-tolkien/","ImpactHub","8 entrepreneurial lessons Tolkien taught us in ‘The Lord of the Rings’","Tomorrow, the 25th of March happens to be the 14th edition of Tolkien Reading Day*. Who doesn’t love some good quest against the inconceivable might, the same one the Lord of the Ring team embarked on, right? We decided the famous fantasy trilogy is not only an exciting read but also a real magical fountain of universal entrepreneurial lessons every changemaker should take to heart. Don’t by shy and read on to learn how to navigate the tricky entrepreneurial paths of your private Mordors! #1 Team up with People, who are Different Look at them all! The fellowship came in all sizes and races. Each of the team had unique unequalled skills – Legolas could see across terrains and never missed with his bow; Gimli’s axe and fearlessness (not to mention staggering self-confidence) kept the foe trembling; Aragorn knew fancy herbs and navigated as if he came equipped with a high-class GPS system and so on… From the outside, the group seemed like a random mix, but the glue of common enterprise for the greater good brought them together. The Fellowship of the Ring aka the well-performing powerhouse shows us how teaming up with people of different personalities, expertise and skills makes sense when exploring the unknown. A much needed voice of reason.>>> Tip: Even if you are a solopreneur, you still need input. Being a member of Impact Hub Vienna means you get access to experts, who live the social impact life. Check our membership packages here or, if you already are a member, check our current programs.Oh and we recently published a handy guide on how to make the most our of your membership. #2 Do not Build Teams of Orcs Having a team made up of people with the same set of skills or character can be a right downer on your productivity, effectiveness, idea-generation and harmony. Let’s take Orcs. Orcs are murderous, vicious, blood-craving and it’s safe to say that, just like mass-produced Uruk-hai, Orcs are pretty consistent in what they want (meat), what they like (kill) and how they get what they like and want (hack repeatedly). This is a great example of how meetings with orcs would go: Tip: Avoid pairing yourself with people with the same personality as yours. When you are an idea generator, make sure you get a doer. If you prefer to run analysis and reports, find a strategist who will implements data-driven solutions. #3 Have a mentor In the books, there will always be somebody smarter, older or more immortal than any character. The chain would just go up and up. And the way the hero and heroines went about it was to respect their mentors and learn from them. With all their might and (sometimes royal) status, the Fellowship would always look up to Gandalf. With all of his wisdom, Gandalf never feared asking Saruman for help (even though he turned out to be a righteous and, to quote Jennifer Cornick, ‘rainbow bastard because he went from “the white” to “many colours‘). Alrite.Tip: Search for a mentor within our global or local Impact Hub Community (to learn how to do it, see this post!). Mastermind groups are one of the best growing tools for entrepreneurs. #4 Know your ecosystem Remember the scene in the ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers’, when an Ent, Treebeard, takes Pippin and Merry towards Isengard? He steps out onto a plain, which once had been populated by his tree-friends, and sees tree stumps peppering the swidden around the tall tower and the soil blackened from the Orcs’ slash-and-burn. This is when it becomes apparent that Saruman did not factor peeved tree-men in to his mighty plan. Just like that, the ecosystem where you decide to nest your business plans should be scanned and scouted for threats and opportunities. Otherwise, one day you might find yourself in an unpleasant and unexpected situation. Had Saruman done his SWOT analysis, he wouldn’t have his house stormed by a group of Fangorns. “Damn, we did not factor assault into scaling risks”#5 Break the Rules Sometimes When Eowyn was sent away to rule in the king’s stead, we all thought she would succumb to the obedient role her elder had envisioned for her and her trip would be done just right and there. This is why some of us were left speechless when she broke the rules and chose her fate, riding into battle disguised as a man. She not only showed some prime sword work but also ended up killing the scariest enemies of all – one of the Black Riders. As an entrepreneur, there will be many moments you will be told to take it slow or skip on your dream because it seems too risky. Bah, you will be told you don’t have what it takes! But why should you back down, when the gut feeling is telling you that you can do it? Had Eowyn listened to her mentor, she would have never proved to herself she could fight the way her folks did. In the end, her courage gave strength to the troops and saved them from a much worse fate. #6 Don’t be a Solo Ring-bearer We all felt it – when Frodo succumbed to Gollum’s persuasion, and Sam was sent off, our hearts broke, and our fists wanted to connect with Mister Baggins’ face. The faithful companion came back to salvage the day, and the journey of two Hobbits continued. Don’t presume you have to do everything yourself, don’t think that sharing your workload will lower the value of your success. Luckily, here at Impact Hub Vienna, we do everything to make sure you know you are not alone! You are a part of a booming community of doers, who are itching to help you walk in and out of Mordor with all your fingers intact. Tip: Feeling lost? Go and talk to one of Impact Hub hosts or join one of the many community events Impact Hub Vienna organizes each month. #7 Venture into the Unknown You know Hobbits? The unadventurous breed of humanoids, who will eat six times per day, smoke pipe-weed and avoid attracting unwanted attention? Had it not been for Bilbo Baggins, with his unusual taste for adventure, Frodo Baggins would always live in literally the same hole, meet the same people and not save the Middle-earth when the time has come. Even though he acted against his nature, he ventured into the unknown and, in the end, became victorious. Action: Whenever you feel you are looking over the borders of your comfort zone, put yourself in the most uncomfortable positions of all. ‘You can’t grow when you’re comfortable’ said Dave Anderson. #8 Embrace Your Leadership Role Aragorn had long avoided his rightful seat at the throne of Gondor, which made his existence the allegory of hide-and-seek. The circumstances finally forced him to act and, boy, did he embrace the leading role his destiny had assigned him. Being an entrepreneur means being in the thick of things. When it comes to your business, your dreams, your ideas, you have to take the lead. Moreover, you probably will have people around you who will be looking up to you. You will hire employees, who will need your direction. Learn how to be a motivational speaker because when the time comes when you will have to convince and an army of undead to follow you, you have to know what you are standing for. Conclusion J. R. R. Tolkien’s fiction continuously amazes readers all over the world with how intricate the details of each character are. The web of fantasy tale acts as a hot glue binding the realm of Middle-earth, but the world he weaved is intrinsically and universally life relatable. * The 25th of March is the date of the downfall of the Lord of the Rings (Sauron) and the fall of Barad-dûr.

Aber sie sind nicht nur den ganzen Tag am arbeiten, sondern Familie und vor allem Freunde haben einen extrem hohen Stellenwert. Für beide ist der Freundeskreis ein wichtiger Nährboden für alle Ideen, Energie und auch Lebenslust. Sie sprechen oft mit Menschen die andere Meinungen vertreten um Ihre Denkweise zu verstehen und sachlicher an alle Diskussionen heranzutreten. Konstantin und Moritz diskutieren generell sehr viel. Konstantin spricht gerne mit vielen Menschen und sieht seine größte Chance in seiner Weiterentwicklung im Austausch mit anderen Menschen mit anderen Sichtweisen und kulturellen Hintergründen. Lobu vereint den Komfort des Online Shoppings mit dem des lokalen Einkaufens. Statt aus großen Lagerhallen weit entfernt wird aus Buchhandlungen in der Nähe des Konsumentens geliefert. Es wird noch am selben Tag mit dem Fahrrad ausgeliefert. Derzeit befindet sich das Projekt in einer Pilotphase im 18. Bezirk aber an der Weiterentwicklung wird schon fest gearbeitet. Was treibt Euch an? Konstantin: Ich glaube es ist enorm wichtig Dinge einfach anzupacken und zu machen. Ich möchte mir nicht nur Gedanken machen, sondern aktiv zum Positiven verändern. Ich habe nur ein Leben und ich möchte so viel bewegen wie nur irgendwie möglich. Wir sind die Generation, welche die nächsten 60 Jahre mit den Folgen der derzeitigen Entwicklung leben muss. Dazu zählt eine vollkommene Fehlentwicklung unserer Wirtschaft. Wir sind dabei unseren gesamten Einzelhandel einem großen Konzern zu überlassen und das ist ein Problem für die ganze Volkswirtschaft. So etwas führt zu dem Verlust von tausenden an Arbeitsplätzen und Steuerleistung, da viele Konzerne Ihre Steuern in anderen Ländern zahlen. Außerdem ist es umwelttechnisch sehr bedenklich Produkte quer durch Europa oder die Welt zu schicken, wenn sie schon in einer Stadt vorhanden sind. Was war vorher da? Die Liebe zu Büchern oder die Überlegung für ein regionales Lieferservice? Also die Liebe zu Büchern hatten wir schon als wir sehr klein waren. Damals wurde uns aus Büchern vorgelesen wurde und ab dem Zeitpunkt an dem wir selbst lesen konnten, haben wir Bücher regelrecht verschlungen. Habt Ihr ein besonderes Verhältnis zu gedruckten Büchern? Konstantin: Ich halte einfach gerne ein gedrucktes Buch in meiner Hand. Ich mag den Geruch und das Geräusch des Seitenblätterns. Welchen Stellenwert nehmen Bücher in Eurem Leben ein? Konstantin: Ich lese sehr gerne und viel, da ein Buch die Möglichkeit bietet sich für einen kurzen Moment eine andere Realität zu erschaffen und in eine andere Welt abzutauchen. Leider bin ich in letzter Zeit kaum zum Lesen gekommen. Mit der Auslieferung mit dem Fahrrad beschreitet ihr einen sehr ökologischen Weg. Welche Rolle spielt Nachhaltigkeit bei Euch? Wir sind der Meinung, dass Nachhaltigkeit nicht nur ein Schlagwort für Unternehmen sein sollte, sondern tatsächlich aktiv ausgeübt werden muss. Gerade wir als junge Menschen müssen versuchen unseren Planeten wieder aufzubauen. Jeder der sich die Entwicklung der Welt ansieht, weiß dass es nicht ewig so weitergehen kann. Wir können nicht alle Ressourcen aufbrauchen und Waren nur aus preislichen Gründen einmal um die Welt schicken. Manchmal erscheint uns unser nicht nachhaltiges Leben auf Kürze günstiger, aber langfristig werden wir einen hohen Preis bezahlen. Wo seht Ihr Euch den nächsten Jahren? Gibt´s Expansionspläne? Auf jeden Fall! Unser erstes Ziel ist es Lobu auf alle Bezirke Wiens auszuweiten und einen übersichtlichen einfachen Webshop zu entwickeln. In weiterer Folge wollen wir mit Lobu auch in mehrere Städte expandieren, um so vielen Menschen wie möglich einen schnellen und fairen Service zu bieten. Gibt´s Vorbilder die Euch geprägt haben? Nicht wirklich. Wir haben uns immer eher auf die Sache konzentriert und versucht eigenständig und innovativ zu bleiben. Wenn wir aber doch Hilfe brauchen, holen wir uns gerne Rat bei Österreichischen Start-Ups wie “Whatchado” oder “Talentify”. Was sind denn so die größten Hürden die es zu bezwingen gilt? Eine große Hürde ist die Finanzierung. Des Weiteren ist es auch nicht immer ganz einfach Lobu mit den Schulzeiten zu vereinbaren. Seid ihr neugierige Menschen? Wenn ja, wie zeigt sich das konkret? Sehr sogar. Moritz ist naturwissenschaftlich sehr interessiert und bastelt zum Beispiel derzeit mit Freunden an einem Prototyp eines neuartigen Mars-Roboters für einen Wettbewerb. Wir sind beide auch sehr neugierig, wenn es darum geht, andere Kulturen kennenzulernen und Abenteuer zu erleben. Aus diesem Grund haben wir beide auch mit dem ASSIST Programm ein Jahr in den USA verbracht. Was bedeutet Glück für Euch? Konstantin: Ich persönlich bin noch auf der Suche nach Glück aber ich erlebe Glück, wenn ich sehe, dass etwas, das ich mir ausgedacht habe, funktioniert. Aber ich glaube, dass es zwei Arten von Glück gibt – einerseits das mehr greifbare und der Erfolg mit Projekten und andererseits das emotionale Glück. Für mich sind meine Freunde unglaublich wichtig und Spaß zu haben. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Eine Perspektive auf eine wirkliche Änderung darin wie der Einzelhandel funktioniert. Wir haben hier eine riesige Chance, um langfristig für eine positive Änderung in der Gesellschaft zu sorgen. Das müssen wir nützen und so sind wir auch nicht ersetzbar. Worauf verzichtest Ihr, um für Euer Start Up zu arbeiten? In erster Linie Schlaf. Und da man den dann doch manchmal braucht, muss auch das Lacrosse Training und die Fitnessstudio Besuche ein bisschen gekürzt werden. Außerdem versäumen wir jetzt wegen Terminen “leider” ab und zu den Unterricht. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Eurer Arbeit? Das tolle daran bei Lobu zu arbeiten ist, dass man in Kontakt mit so vielen verschiedenen interessanten Menschen kommt. Jeden Tag schreiben uns Menschen, denen das Projekt einfach gefällt und das ist dann wirklich sehr motivierend nachdem man so viel Arbeit investiert hat. Wer sind Eure wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Der Hauptverband der österreichischen Buchhandlungen und die Buchhandlungen selbst. Sie sind begeistert von dem Projekt und ohne eine nachhaltige Kooperation mit ihnen hätte das Ganze auch keinen Sinn. Wer baut Euch auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Wir beide ergänzen uns so gut, dass häufig nur eine Person niedergeschlagen ist, weil der Andere es dann doch schafft das positive zu sehen. So können wir uns gegenseitig unterstützen. Sonst sind unsere Familie und unsere Freunde immer für uns da und so haben wir jemanden, mit denen wir über Probleme reden können. Wohin wird Euch diese Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Geheime Projekte gibt es keine, aber wir haben natürlich Pläne dafür, wie wir unser Projekt vergrößern könnten <U+0001F609> Was sagen eigentlich Eure Freunde, Euer Umfeld, Eure Familien zu diesem Engagement? Alle mit denen wir bis jetzt geredet haben, waren unserem Projekt gegenüber sehr positiv eingestellt. Wir haben auch tolles Feedback bekommen und schätzen und den Rückhalt den uns unser Umfeld gibt. Habt Ihr Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Ta – Nehisi Coates und Glawinic Habt Ihr einen Wunsch? Dass Lobu auch in 30 Jahren noch besteht und sich kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt hat. Habt Ihr für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen webtipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Jede Buchhandlung ist ein toller Platz, um sich Inspiration zu holen. Das entdecken von neuen Schätzen und das schlichte auskosten der ruhigen Atmosphäre ist viel Wert in unserer hektischen Welt. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Mariam Al-Ayash von “Wiener Portraits”! Sie macht die besten Videos in der ganzen Stadt (und über die ganze Stadt).","March 28, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Konstantin-Klingler-Moritz-Stephan-Es-ist-enorm-wichtig-Dinge-einfach-anzupacken-und-zu-machen-600x400.png"

Instead of throwing loads of books at you, we have decided to comb through our Netflix and AmazonPrime accounts to find the best documentaries for social entrepreneurs. We have found eight awesome films, including an Oscar winner. Throughout all the films you will see extraordinary heroes, social entrepreneurs who have made it to the big leagues, business people who are trying to create fair trade supply chains, and people who walk a mile in someone else’s shoes. And so, without further fanfare, here are our picks. Food Inc. From organic food giants to neighbourhood food movements, and from lobbyists to legislators this film has it all covered. Director Robert Kenner takes a close look at food – from policy, corporations, and entrepreneurs. Kenner weaves together multiple unconnected stories to create a varied tapestry with help from Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eKYyD14d_0 The True Cost Director Andrew Morgan approaches the fashion industry through the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013. The horrific tragedy is the impetus for his examination of the fast fashion problem. From environmental effects to human rights issues he does not shy away from any aspect of the sordid economic sector. Along the way you meet organic cotton farmers, a woman in India who is trying to make a life for her daughter, and several entrepreneurs trying to build better supply chains. Codegirl This one is simple – girls banding together to improve their communities and lives through technology. While computer science was undoubtedly founded by women (thank you Ada Lovelace, and all the amazing programmers, compilers, calculators, and codecrackers that came after her), the gender gap is widening within the employment segment. Watch this if you want to find out ways to create a more inclusive environment. The Startup Kids Two Icelandic entrepreneurs decide to travel the world to find inspiring stories of other start-ups and new, small businesses. The two women are in the tech business, more specifically gamification apps, and wanted to inspire others to pursue their passion and hopes to start their own businesses. Some of the biggest personalities in the cloud business are interviewed for this feature length film. Catching the Sun The film looks at the solar power industry – from dispelling myths to understanding the appeal of solar energy, as opposed to cheaper forms of clean energy. Naysayers and proponents alike are featured in the film, as the directors and producers hoped to provide a balance look at the industry. While the film features Americans heavily there are other entrepreneurs from around the world and their stories. The White Helmets This Oscar winning documentary short film follows those brave rescue workers on the front lines of the Syrian Civil Defence. Their day to day activities are captured well and the pace is fast, even for something this short. The run time is forty minutes but you will need some downtime once the credits have rolled as the film is quite intense. Living on One Dollar This documentary is made by a group of college students who try an experiment. They are going to, as closely, as possible mimic the conditions of those living in poverty in South America. They struggle through illness and hunger – living on one dollar a day. They meet their neighbours and learn how they have coped with some of the financial challenges they have faced. As well as entrepreneurs who are trying to make a better life for themselves and their families through micro-financing. Islands of the Future This is a documentary series featuring Europe’s coastal islands and how they are dealing with the oncoming energy crisis. Islanders use every eco-energy method available to them to power life on the island. There are five episodes total – so be prepared to binge watch. It is spring – there are bound to be some days of unpredictable weather. Hopefully, we have just given you something to do when it is rainy outside (or when you lack the inspiration to do anything).

"113","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/03/31/networking-savoir-vivre-become-networking-superstar/","ImpactHub","Networking savoir-vivre: how to become a networking superstar"," How many of us switch on an undistinguishable tiny panic button when hearing the word networking? It’s the idea that we have to go to this after work thing, dressed in a business or business-casual attire, sip on some kind of beverage and put our best attitude forward just so we can get noticed and create relationships out of thin air, connect with people we are not confident we can connect with, making sure we don’t miss an opportunity to be out there. But it doesn’t have to be like that. With the big Impact Hub Vienna 7th birthday’s celebrations looming on the horizon (it’s next week people! Details here ?) we thought we will help you out and teach you how to network with these 5 easy to implement tips on how to become a networking superstar. 1. Start the conversation The whole point of a networking event is to give attendees the opportunity to meet people that they would otherwise not get the chance to meet. Whether you are alone or attending with friends, business partners or colleagues, take the time to look around and introduce yourself to someone outside your familiar circle. Easy conversation starters like asking opinions on the organization of the event, remarks about the venue/food/drinks or simply complimenting someone’s choice of accessorizing are topics that can create a more relaxed environment and get people talking faster. 2. Be genuine Every networking event is frequented by smart, ambitious people that “hunt” for opportunities that only benefit themselves. It might seem that they get ahead in the short run, but in the long run, no one wants to work with or for someone who only thinks about themselves. If you want to create genuine relationships, don’t base your interactions solely on the thought of reciprocity. Smile, talk about your passions, identify what the other’s needs are and connect with them by trying to find a solution to their problem before you ask for something in return. Express your enjoyment, surprise or delight of meeting someone, only if you genuinely feel like the time spent together has provided you with those sentiments. People can generally feel and notice- whether consciously or not- when others are insincere and with networking you always want to aim for creating a positive impression. 3. Don’t be a snob for titles We’ve all been there: you need to make a fast sale or are looking for a new job, so it seems imperative you talk to “the person in charge”. However, a lot of people forget that an organization is not just run by one single person and that there is a connectivity that happens at all levels of the company. So don’t dismiss someone just because you find his or her title is unimpressive. Instead, try to see what the person you are conversing with has to offer. 4. Have a plan Planning ahead is generally a good application to life itself. Going with the flow might be an effective attitude if you are not sure where you want to end up, but when you want to reach a goal, having a plan or a structured idea can help you save time, avoid misunderstandings and uncomfortable situations. Knowing what you need to get out of the events you are attending is just as important as knowing what you can offer. If you get the chance, look up the people who will be attending ahead of time and structure your presentation accordingly. 5. Follow up To get the most out of an event, follow up quickly. After the event, the hype and adrenaline of meeting so many people and listening to tons of pitches and stories tends to decrease -on some level we have already satisfied our need of connection and sharing, so most ideas and plans that were discussed remain just that- ideas and plans. However, people that do follow up on their contacts and persist in creating outcomes after the event are the ones that successfully and efficiently use the resources that were put at their disposition to stand out from the masses and actually generate the results a networking event is aiming for.

"114","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/03/let-them-eat-cake-birthday-cake/","ImpactHub","Let them Eat Cake – Birthday Cake","Get your party pants on because we are serving up birthday cake. In honour of Impact Hub Vienna’s seventh birthday we made a delicious baked confection to share with you all, in the form of a recipe, because we ate it all. After waffling (baking pun intended) about how we should approach the recipe we opted to make a vegan cake. There are many reasons that we went with this option. First, and foremost, because Impact Hub Vienna is an inclusive group, we wanted everyone to be able to share in the celebration. Second, we wanted to adopt some of the principles of sustainable eating, one of which is eating fewer animal products. And third, we just thought it would taste super fantastic. Making the Cake We don’t often cook on the Impact Hub Vienna blog, let alone bake. So, this is relatively new territory for us. One of us (namely me), has been watching far too much Great British Bake Off and so volunteered to take on the task of making the cake. Which also meant finding the recipe and adapting it. After scouring the internet, and my shelves of cookbooks, I learned that there was a bit of a formula to vegan cakes. And so, we mashed a bunch of recipes together and created a brand new one – just for you. We gathered all the ingredients together – and you can find all of them quite easily, in this case, your local grocery store. As we went for a coconut flavour, we used coconut milk in the cake – which has a high proportion of natural fats. However, you can substitute this for one cup of any vegan milk with a half a cup of oil of your choice (coconut, walnut, whatever). Keeping in mind that this will affect the flavour of your cake – so chocolate soy milk and almond oil will taste a bit different than, say, hazelnut milk and hazelnut oil. You really ought to use a smaller tin for this cake – 22 cm is the ideal size. owever, if you do not happen to have a 22cm circular tin around your kitchen, then improvise. Like we did. We used a tin with a hole in the middle because it decreased the total surface area that the cake would have to cover, which meant it worked out just fine. Now that we have the basics covered – ready, get set, BAKE. The Good Stuff Without further ado, here is the recipe that we cooked up for you. We adapted this from Thug Kitchen’s first cookbook Thug Kitchen: Eat Like You Give a F*ck – The Official Cookbook. These are also non-metric measurements – so you may need to do some conversions if you do not have measuring cups. Ingredients: 2 cups spelt flour, with extra to dust the tin ¾ cup sugar (you can get organic and fair trade sugar – but I used what I had in the house which was from a local sugar refinery). 2 tsp baking powder ½ tsp salt 1 ½ cup canned coconut milk 1 tsp vanilla paste ½ tsp grated ginger Fun coloured sprinkles (optional, but it is a birthday cake, so you need to make it look festive) coconut oil, for greasing the tin Method Preheat your oven to 190° Grease and flour your tin using a vegan oil – we used fair trade coconut oil. Spread oil all over the tin and then dust flour on the tin; turn the tin to evenly distribute the flour. Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and ginger in a mixing bowl. Using a wire whisk, mix all the dry ingredients together (or use a sieve if you are a disciple of baking properly). Add the rest of the ingredients and mix with a spoon, wire whisk, or electric mixer until it creates a smooth batter – be careful not to over work otherwise your cake will not rise well. Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes – but check your cake often. It is ready when you stab it with a sharp implement of some sort and it comes out clean. Let the cake cool for a while in the tin – at least 15 minutes. Then turn out onto a rack to cool a little further. DO NOT put icing on the cake until it is completely cool. Some of us learned that lesson the hard way. Put sprinkles on the frosted cake. Cut and serve to friends and family who decided that cake was enough of a reason to celebrate with you – regardless of the occasion. We frosted the cake using a standard sugar and water icing and some sprinkles – because every cake needs some sprinkles. However, you can use coconut whipping cream to frost this cake or decorate with fresh fruit. There are so many options. #gallery-0 { margin: auto; } #gallery-0 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 49%; } #gallery-0 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-0 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } $(document).ready(function() { /* * Simple image gallery.

With the anniversary just around the corner, here are seven good reasons to celebrate with us. 1. Members The Hub wouldn’t exist without me, you and your fellow members. Therefore, let’s celebrate each other and how great it is to simply be part of the Hub. Don’t be a stranger. Share your stories and get advice from members who are all wonderful people, each with great insight, ambition, and experience. View the list of Impact Hub Vienna members here. 2. Support Support goes a long way to success. Nobody who ever made it, made it there alone—everyone received some help along the way. At the Hub, there aren’t just support programs for your entrepreneurial needs, there’s also the fantastic people you meet every day who support you and your ideas to change the world. If you need any help, just ask. 3. Iss mich! Can’t forget about the iss mich bistro at the Hub itself! We all rely on their coffee to fuel us throughout the day. Besides serving great coffee, iss mich uses high quality fresh produce, that does not meet retail standards due to aesthetics, to create delicious vegetarian dishes. The food is always amazing and eating from one of their jars reduces both food and plastic waste. 4. Events There’s almost always something going on at the Hub and the events are great opportunities to learn, engage, and connect with others. From Sexy Salad Tuesdays to Yoga, to skillshare breakfasts to dancing, to community cooking to internal and external events that can help your business; every day is another opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. With the birthday party promosing big turnout, make sure you attend it to reap the benefits. Scared of networking. Read our guide on becoming a networking superstar. 5. The Hosts The Hub would be nothing without the wonderful hosts who take care of everyone and are key to the running of the Hub itself. Without them, the Hub wouldn’t be what it is today. Let’s celebrate them for their dedicated hard work! 6. Vienna Let’s not just celebrate the Hub, let’s also celebrate the wonderful city that it’s in. Vienna is consistently voted one of the best places in the world to live. There are so many wonderful things to see and do. Check out the museums, eat at the restaurants, and marvel at the stunning architecture. So let’s take a moment and celebrate how lucky we are to live here. 7. Family The Hub is a family—a family of social entrepreneurs working together trying to make a difference in the world. We should celebrate that fact because you don’t find that just anywhere. With open hearts and open minds, we want to make the world a better place. It’s a beautiful thing. Join the party! April 6th, 2017 from 16:00 – 21:30 at the Hub. There will be a fun recap of the last 7 years, great food and drinks from iss mich, Brotpiloten and Vollpension, live music, and a Members’ market where you can buy products and services and support your fellow members!

The 7th birthday of our Hub is tomorrow so a look back at the timeline of Impact Hub Vienna moments was inevitable. We sifted through the memorable events, turning points in the history of our Impact Hub and lots of photos. And they were all awesome. How to pick only seven of them to celebrate the 7 years cycle of Impact Hub Vienna’s existence? We gave this almost impossible task to IHV co-founder and director, Matthias Reisinger. Here are his best seven moments of Impact Hub Vienna! #1 2010: Opening of Impact Hub Vienna with Muhammad Yunus #2 2010 Hosting the Social Entrepreneurship Seminar at the European Forum Alpbach In August 2015 Impact Hub Vienna welcomed the Social Entrepreneurship Seminar at the European Forum Alpbach, an interdisciplinary platform for science, politics, business and culture established in 1945. The seminar explored the concept, idea and phenomenon of social entrepreneurship with particular focus on its form and relevance in the Central European context and on gaining insights into the personal lifecycle and development path of social entrepreneurs. Check out the photos from this event on our Facebook page here, here and here. #3 2013 Merger of IHV and IHV Incubation Center + Implementation of Holacracy Since September 2013, Impact Hub Vienna employs a holacratic structure of governance after a long quest for the right organizational structure. Alexis Eremia, co-founder of the Impact Hub Vienna shares her perspective on the process: “I’ve been passionate and concerned with leadership and organisational development for over 12 years, to realise that most of the theories can not thrive without a radical shift in structure. Holacracy is the only system I found that creates engagement and authority equally balanced with self-accountability. It is fascinating to observe the insecurity people feel once they realise the leader is not there anymore. It opens up a space for learning. Few months later in the process, the organisation looks completely different. The system just functions, independent of specific individuals, independent of changes.” (Source: Can Holocracy improve your social venture?, published on the Impact Hub Vienna blog on 24th February 2014) #4 2013 Organising Design for Impact + Hosting the Global Impact Hub Gathering On October 15 2013, 300 impact practitioners from all over the world gathered in MAK in Vienna, to look at best case practices of systems transformations and distill principles of “design for impact”.

View more photos on our Facebook page.#5 2015 Opening of Second Space The Impact Hub Vienna acquired the ground floor of the building at Lindegasse 56 in 2015 and expanded by 1200m²! It’s incredible to think that once the Hub lived only on that second floor of Lindegasse 56 behind the code protected doors. But the community grew and grew, and soon it became evident the Hub needed to expand to make all the amazing people comfortable. Take a trip back in time and read this official announcement of Impact Hub Vienna growing in size posted on the 16th of March 2015, which also includes vidoes of what the ground floor used to look like. #6 2016 Being in Forbes Magazine among the top 20 incubators world-wide#7 2017 Number one in Member Survey responses for the second year in a row In other words: you crushed it! Thank you for taking part in the survey and helping Impact Hub Vienna become better and better every year. Celebrate with us! Join us this Thursday at 4pm to kick off birthday festivities.

As opposed to working from home alone and in your pyjamas. This is true for most of the people who choose to work in coworking spaces, and also the reason why people thrive in such places as said on Harvard Business Review. But how to get to know all these amazing people? Come to the party and talk to them! And P!NK’s famous song goes: “Makin’ my connection as I enter the room Everybody’s chillin’ as I set up the groove Pumpin’ up the volume with this brand new beat Everybody’s dancin’ and their dancin’ for me I’m your operator, you can call anytime I’ll be your connection to the party line” But what if I don’t know how to break the ice at a party? Let’s face it, how comfortable are you in approaching strangers in a party? Or even going to a party for the sake of mingling with people you don’t know? If you are like me, your answer is probably “not so much.” But you know you want to! Here is a hack to beat awkwardness, get out of your comfort zone, and win at this week’s party, and every social event that follows: The Dinner Party Download podcast. “Dinner Party Download is an hour-long celebration of culture, food and conversation designed to help you dazzle your friends at this weekend’s get-together. In every episode, you’ll learn a joke, bone up on an odd bit of history and then wash it down with a themed cocktail. Plus, unconventional wisdom from hosts Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam.” Since the first time I listened to the Dinner Party Download, a couple of years ago, I have become a devotee and a huge advocate of the show. The podcast is structured in segments like a real dinner party. Although an hour-long, it feels much shorter, as it is always witty and fast-paced. To get things started, there is an Icebreaker, a celebrity tells a short and embarrassingly cheesy joke. Then there is the Small Talk, which is a piece of quirky news that most probably has been overlooked, while we were paying attention to the headlines. Followed by Cocktails (A History Lesson with Booze), where the hosts tell us “something fascinating that happened this week in history” then they invite a bartender to create a drink inspired by the historical event. My favourite segments of the show are The Guest of Honor and Etiquette. There is always a Guest of Honor, a super entertaining, informal, in-depth and, sadly, super short interview with one of the world’s top filmmakers, actors, writers, artists or musicians. The last episode they talked with film director Danny Boyle about his most recent movie, T2 Trainspotting. In this same episode, they invited no one less than drag queen- superstar-diva, Ru Paul, to answer Etiquette questions, submitted by listeners. Questions are usually on how to behave politely in awkward situations. Sr. Ian McKellen , Gandalf himself, has answered these burning questions on the show before. The result is a mix of good advice and big laughs. In short, with its blend of pop cultural current events, food trends and alcohol, this show has everything you need to win your next dinner party. I hope you take advantage of my secret weapon and come prepared to have some great conversation and connect with all the amazing people that will be at our party. Check it out!

However it looks like the IT team didn’t properly erase the data on it. Curiously the following is the only thing they left. I could not find any Mark Thomson currently at the company so I attach the message to you. Kind regards, Pete. From: Mark Thomson Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 18 February 2017 at 09:07:29 GMT+1 To: Tara Harris Hey, I’m sorry for this long delay. I had a crazy couple of months and I did not have time to keep to our agreement. I’m loaded with thoughts and certain sensation of hopelessness. I hope this message will not be a drag on your days… but isn’t that the reason why we decided to write instead of talk in the first place? Go, get a cup of coffee, sit down, open your umbrella and get ready to get wet under my dark grey cloud. There are so many stories, events, opportunities, trainings programs. So many options for me to feel as if I still need to do more in order to finally become successful. I tried it all, and in the end I would always find myself in the same place: without money and struggling. I just don’t know anymore if trying to do something meaningful, walking the difficult path is worth the effort. I don’t even know what is the purpose of all of this. The only thing I know is that I need money in order to move forward. You know, I am aware I should feel grateful because I live in a country full of opportunities with access to all the basics and blah blah blah. However, I do not feel that way because everything is so freaking difficult anyway. If I get a job I can last a month but I will feel forced; If I go the startup way, I’ll have to work very hard and, most likely than not, I’ll not earn enough money either. Yes I know, I’m trapped in a pessimistic whirlpool. I’m ready for your rainbow <U+0001F642> — From: Tara Harris Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 18 February 2017 at 13:21:43 GMT+1 To: Mark Thomson You are not the only one lagging in our correspondence. My seeds of success were sown a few months ago and I started to see some of them growing. I dedicated myself to “water” them to see if they would grow any faster. In the meantime my daytime job is paying the bills. I made some time to enjoy a couple of days hiking with Tom. They were amazing. You know, I understand how you feel. Isn’t almost everybody in the same situation? I gave up the idea of becoming the best architect ever; that rat race is futile. I just decided to be extremely pragmatic, realistic and manage to free enough time to enjoy my weekends to the fullest. I don’t care if my dad thinks I wasted my architecture degree and my mom thinks I’m getting too old to get pregnant. I got a job to pay the bills and have my weekends free. I dedicate a few hours per week to keep illustrating, which makes me forget the world around me. And you know what? A friend of a friend just asked me to illustrate her new phantasy book! She is also just starting so she offered me a small payment – I’ll use it to surprise Tom one of these days. — From: Mark Thomson Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 19 February 2017 at 01:17:11 GMT+1 To: Tara Harris Yup, I must keep it simple and focused and I need to reward my efforts with enjoyable weekends. I was thinking to build an aquaponics system to support my organic production of herbs. Sounds as a great weekend project, doesn’t it? If I understand correctly, you are trying to tell me that instead of focusing on what I need to improve I should pay attention to what is possible at the moment? And when you say that you gave up your career as an architect, you mean you changed your expectations of an amazing professional future for the satisfaction of keep illustrating without the pressures of a traditional job? Aren’t you afraid of staying with your current small job, and never achieving your potential and economic success? — From: Tara Harris Subject: Re: f2f secret messaging Date: 19 February 2017 at 16:23:28 GMT+1 To: Mark Thomson Well yes, it worries me a bit. I’ve heard that if I don’t try to strive for the top, I will never get there. But if everybody else is trying to do the same is there going to be enough space for all of us at the top? Is ‘the top’ the only place to arrive at in order to enjoy a normal life? Although I never thought to work as an assistant for a small logistics company, I’m doing a good job and maybe I’ll even get a promotion. It’s the kind of potential I wasn’t even considering. My art happens when I’m at peace at home and I truly hope it manages to inspire others in unexpected ways. At the end of the day what is your full potential? Isn’t it the unexpected result of a life with meaning?

"119","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/12/nonviolent-communication-improve-interactions-others/","ImpactHub","Nonviolent Communication: Improve your interactions with others","We always tend to think we’re good communicators and believe it’s someone else that’s the problem. It’s something we think we’ve mastered and that’s why we’re often confused when it blows up in our face. How many times have you stood there scratching your head, bewildered about what just happened? More than enough is my guess. And you know what you can’t afford when relying on working with other people as an entrepreneur? Being misunderstood. It’s counterproductive, expensive (time is also a valuable currency) and frustrating for you and your team members. This is where Nonviolent Communication (NVC), also known as Compassionate Communication, comes in. Developed by Marshall Rosenberg, an American psychologist, NVC provides a framework to understand each others’ needs and promotes a way of using language to improve how we talk to one another. It has been successfully applied all over the world in a variety of areas including education, mediation, and organizational and business settings. What is Nonviolent Communication? NVC works under the theory that we all share the same needs and conflicts arise when we miscommunicate and fail to address the needs of others. It advocates the use of positive language and that we be non-judgmental and empathetic towards others. The goal is to communicate compassionately, to find out what people’s needs are and to work together to satisfy the needs of all involved. There are 4 components to NVC. In brief, these are: Observation: We observe only the facts of what was said and try not to apply meaning or significance. Feelings: What we are feeling in the moment. Expressing these feelings can help resolve conflicts and misunderstandings. Needs: We all have needs. Our lives and what we do and say are in service to those needs. Request: After observing and recognizing feelings and needs non-judgmentally, we request an action that is not a demand using clear and positive language. Watch ‘Vulnerable honesty’ by Yoram Mosenzon, a Certified Trainer in NVC, at TEDxAmsterdamED NVC can be quite different to how we typically communicate with one another. The primary thing to keep in mind about NVC is that it’s about compassionate communication through a connection with yourself and others, while trying to express yourself honestly. The ultimate goal is to communicate better. If you want to implement NVC in your own life or in an organization, know that there will be a transition period and it’s something that takes practice like any skill or sport. Very few of us, if any, get it right on the first go. Just remember, practice makes perfect. Where to learn more about NVC? To find out more about NVC, check out The Center for Nonviolent Communication. You can also read the book Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by theman himself, Marshall Rosenberg. To connect with the local NVC community, find seminars or workshops, check out Gewaltfreie Kommunikation Austria. Want to know more about Impact Hub?

You’ve probably used those services just like I have. But what is the sharing economy? The definition of it is fairly broad but basically, it’s the peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services through an online marketplace. Access instead of ownership. You don’t always need to drive a car so why own one if you can simply pay for one or borrow one when you need it? At Impact Hub Vienna, we have a few members that we’d like to shine a spotlight on who are leading the way in the local sharing economy. FragNebenan FragNebenan is a social network for urban neighbourhoods. It’s a place for neighbours to connect and share knowledge, resources, organise mutual aid, or they can just chat about local issues. FragNebenan also empowers neighbours to organize and interact with property managers, community initiatives and local authorities. Its goal is to help remove some of the anonymity of living in a city, lower the barriers between neighbours, and get people who live near each other to connect. They’ve also got a great blog that highlights and discusses certain issues that tend to come about when people live next to each other in a community. hey! The Sharing Community hey! Vienna is a local sharing community where people can offer products for rent and services for hire. You can rent bikes for a weekend outing in the countryside, a GoPro to record it, or if you don’t want to organize any of these things yourself, you can sign up for a bike tour instead. If you’re in the mood for it, you can hire a personal trainer, a photographer, and you can even take a basket-weaving workshop. Skillshare Breakfast Skillshare Breakfast is a monthly mini-workshop event series hosted by and for members of Impact Hub Vienna, aiming to provide a platform for skill-exchange among the members of the community on a crowdsourced (bring-your-own-breakfast) basis. It is a great way to meet inspiring members, learn some new skills and even share your skills. For more info on the upcoming Skillshare Breakfasts get in touch with Alex [[email protected]].

"121","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/04/19/impactful-summer-holidays/","ImpactHub","Impactful Summer Holidays","Spring will shortly give way to summer, which means that I start thinking about planning my summer holidays. My options are apparently endless. There are the sun-drenched beaches throughout the Mediterranean, taking in the lengthy days in Scandinavia, or hiking in the Alps. However, there is a new question to add to my usual holiday booking checklist. Can I have an impactful summer holiday – to feel good and to do good? Perrine, at Shades Tours, inspired me to go looking at the various cities in which I wanted to vacation. Her post for Vienna includes a whole range of options like shopping at a local upcycling boutique to cake at an intergenerational café. Need a place to stay? Perrine has that covered too, a hotel that employs refugees. Using Perrine’s criteria, I spend time looking on the internet to see what I can find in the places that I most want to visit. And because I know that I am not the only one looking for this information, we put together a tool kit to help you book your own impactful holiday adventures, no matter where you end up. Where to stay Socially responsible hotels take many forms – they can employ refugees like Vienna’s own Hotel Magdas, they can be environmentally friendly, they can spearhead charities looking to decrease poverty or hunger. There are dozens of lists available on the internet with responsible hotels, our favourite was Make Time to See the World (it was also the longest and most complete). However, a quick internet search for any city can pull up numerous hotels based on your criteria. Like boutique Ibsens Hotel in Copenhagen where you can pay in ArtMoney or Hotel Park in Split that started a recycled soap factory that employs disabled persons. Or, you can tap into the sharing economy. Airbnb is a popular website for booking apartments, rooms, or bed and breakfasts in any city. Where to eat Finding restaurants and bakeries that meet dietary needs and preferences, as well as provide sustainable food and are socially responsible is a herculean task – even on the internet. However, keep an eye out for local businesses. Generally, there are always a few vegetarian and vegan restaurants in every city. Sometimes, you run into a few gems, like The Social Bite that provides jobs and meals to the homeless in Edinburgh. You can choose to buy a meal for a homeless person by just doubling your tab. Dans Le Noir in Paris offers dining and spa experiences in the dark, to provide the guest with a small notion of what it is like to be blind. Their guides are all blind and all product ambassadors across Europe. Or take cooking classes from local schools and institutions. Most small course providers offer market tours along with the cooking class, giving you an idea of the flavour of local cuisine and allowing you to cook with a larger group and eat with people that you have never met before. Where to Shop This is completely dependent on what you wish to purchase. If you are looking for trousers in Amsterdam, I would suggest the eco-friendly and socially responsible Denham, with three boutiques in the Nine Streets. If you are looking for clothing and accessories in London, then head to People Tree, necessary for every socially responsible fashionista. There is another opportunity to support local businesses. Look for craftspeople and locally made items that you cannot find anywhere else. Don’t skip on freshmarket experience- where else the true colours and aroma of the city reside if not at the fruit and veg open markets? Research, which ones are the real deal with local people, local produce and the unparallaled atmosphere of truly getting to know a place through local cuisine. What to do There are always art galleries and museums in every major city as well as a bevy of iconic sites. But are there other things to do? Of course, there are! You just need to look. Take a street art walking tour in Paris. Find all the comic book murals in Brussels. Take a running tour in Amsterdam. Walking tours are always a good bet – not only are you getting an intimate view of the city with a local tour guide you are also saving carbon emissions and doing something positive for your health. Check out the extensive network of Free Walking Tours here, here, and here. They are guided by qualified tour guides, who share their favourite spots in the city together with captivating stories from the past. The tours operate on pay-as-much-as-you-want basis. Set yourself up for a spot of “tree bathing”, the new trend, in any city. Parks, hiking trails, and cemeteries offer tree lined and contemplative spaces. No matter where you decide to go – there will always be options. All it takes is a modicum of planning and using your already keen sense of social responsibility.

It’s by your side all the time. Your life, social and professional, is in this device. A day without it makes you feel disoriented and lost. It’s that important. But have you ever thought about how your smartphone is made? What’s in a smartphone? From the minerals that are necessary for the components to the working conditions of those who assemble the phone, the production of smartphones is fraught with conflict. Essential minerals for smartphones such as gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten are sometimes sourced from parts of the world that have extremely poor labor conditions for workers. The purchase of these minerals, depending on the area from where they are sourced, may also help provide financial support to serious conflicts. The entire supply chain of smartphone production from beginning to end contains a minefield of serious issues that many major manufacturers choose to ignore. But there’s one company out there looking to change all that. Fairphone Fairphone is a social enterprise company based in Amsterdam whose mission is to develop, design, and produce socially responsible smartphones. From the supply chain through to production, their goal is to ethically source the materials necessary for production while also ensuring that labor conditions are fair. While they acknowledge that it is not yet possible to produce a 100% fair phone, their goal to do so has the aim to raise awareness among consumers and the mobile phone industry about the issues that they face. Alongside their achievement of sourcing conflict-free tin and tantalum, Fairphone has managed to build the first-ever Fairtrade gold supply chain in the consumer electronics industry. They operate with a commitment to transparency and you can find things such as a list of their suppliers as well as an explanation as to how they decided to pick their production partners on their website. The phone itself The latest phone from Fairphone is the Fairphone 2. It is the first modular smartphone available for consumers and it is designed for a longer than average lifespan of 5 years. The modular nature of the phone allows for parts to be easily replaced by the user extending the lifespan of the phone, reducing the need to replace the entire device thereby reducing the user’s environmental impact on the planet. So if you’re in the market for a new phone and are looking to support a company that supports social change, look into a Fairphone. Impact Hub Want to know more about Impact Hub?

Which means that inspiration can come from being curled up on your couch watching your favourite movie with a bowl of popcorn. So, we have curated a list of the nine best movies for entrepreneurs. The Intern Anne Hathaway plays an internet start-up leader with a growing company and brand. Robert DeNiro plays an unassuming retired phone book executive (you read that right). With nothing to do at home, as retirement has stripped him of his social and intellectual identity, he takes a “senior intern” opportunity at the expanding start up. You absolutely will love the opening sequence of the film. The trials and tribulations of being a woman in a leadership role and having to balance life and work are examined lightheartedly in some cases and with great emotion in others. Sunshine Cleaning Company Well, cleaning up crime scenes sounds like a good way to make money and that is what these two sisters, played by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt find out. They struggle with unknown regulations, certifications, and relationship issues along the way. Alan Arkin plays their quirky father with his own entrepreneurial bent – which is often misdirected. This quirky comedy will have you cheering for the one-armed man. The Pursuit of Happyness Starring Will Smith as Christopher Gardner, a single dad in harshly impoverished circumstances trying to create a better life for himself and his son. The film follows Gardner through his flagging sales career, the dissolution of his marriage, his eviction, and homelessness with his son in tow, attaining a coveted unpaid internship, and later his triumphant achievement of a full-time position as a stock broker. This film will give you the inspiration to persevere against any challenge to achieve your goal. Moneyball Brad Pitt stars in this film that shows the usefulness of data to achieve glory. Pitt’s character, Billy Beane, uses an unconventional approach to scouting prospective players for the Oakland Athletics – data. In the sport that covets statistics more than anything else it seemed that, until recently, teams were built on instinct. The difficulties of getting this new methodology accepted and tracked is at the hear of the film, as well as the successes of various teams who have adopted it. This film is necessary for any entrepreneur who is breaking new ground. Office Space Sometimes we must define things by negation to truly understand them. That is what Office Space gives the entrepreneur. Following the antics of Peter Gibbons at Initech the film is a biting satire of life in a large corporation – from cover pages on reports to issues with the printer. This film will make you thankful that you do not work in a traditional cube farm. Joy Joy Mangano, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is the inventor of the self-drying mop. The idea strikes her after cutting her hands by wringing out a mop filled with broken glass. The film follows the trials and tribulations of bringing a new product to market. Joy’s personal and professional lives intertwine to create a tale of treachery and deceit in business. Sometimes, you need to know when to learn from the mistakes of others instead of making them yourself. The Angel’s Share The socially conscious director Ken Loach brings us the story of a troubled young man who has recently become a father. Robbie’s life is fraught with violence and the addition of his partner and son have only created new difficulties. The entrepreneurial spirit of this young man mean theft and reselling stolen goods at the beginning. He still manages to get himself straightened out in the end and lands his dream job working for a whiskey distillery without the threat of violence in his hometown. While these films do not all show the happy side of entrepreneurship, they do provide plenty of inspiration to persevere against all challenges.So, for the next movie night choose one of these and feel productive while eating your giant bowl of popcorn.

No, really – we mean visiting multiple countries and getting a taste of their culture without travelling beyond the borders of our beautiful city. Don’t believe us? Let’s talk about a colourful initiative by Impact Hub Vienna members, Route28. Route28 is a one-day event happening on the 6th of May at Museumsquartier, which offers the Vienna’s residents an opportunity to travel across the continent in creative and ingenious ways, right in their own backyard. By choosing one of the seven creative routes you get to experience Europe’s feeling in an entirely different way: compete in a Dutch “slow-biking” competition, make Polish pierogi, participate in an Irish pub quiz, celebrate a Swedish birthday complete with Pippi Longstocking, and many others. Europe is a feeling Created by Katharina Moser and her colleagues at the creative agency MOSAIK, Route28 helps people get excited about being European. They are convinced that ‘a personal experience increases the interest in another country and personal contact strengthens empathy’ (source). This is especially important given the wave of populism that has swept through the world and makes us feel disconnected from our nearest neighbours. Moser and her team wanted to highlight that differences between countries do exist – but that this diversity is rather a source of mutual inspiration, exchange and fun instead of fear or distance. ©Luiza PuiuCreating connections via Route28 What links Belgium, Ireland, and the Czech Republic? That is easy – they are all collaborators. A travel guide will take you to several countries that are linked in new and interesting ways. What about aperitifs and small talk in France, a cooking course in Poland, and a poetry slam in Germany? While participating in exciting activities, the travellers will get to know not such well-known aspects of different cultures and immerse themselves in authentic experiences. Each station will be staffed with people coming from the countries you will be visiting at the event, which connects further and removes the stigma of unexplored lands through personal contact. ©Sascha Osaka Where: Route28 kicks off at the MuseumsQuartier at 1 pm on May 6. You can find all the details on the official Route28 website. What: There will be an opening concert in the courtyard and then the travellers are on their way. There are 15 stations along seven travel routes, there is even one for the younger travellers. The event is in German and also a great event for the whole family. Register for Route28 here.

"125","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/02/david-witzeneder/","ImpactHub","David Witzeneder: “Ein einfaches und zufriedenes Leben mit einer spannenden Arbeit hat Qualität.”","David Witzeneder blickt gerne auf seine glückliche Kindheit am Land zurück. Nach der Ausbildung zum Techniker in einer HTL wollte David die Welt bereisen und lebte anschließend in Lettland und Costa Rica. Das war für Ihn eine sehr wichtige Zeit. Mindestens genauso wichtig ist bis heute das Meditieren um fokussiert zu bleiben. David ist Imker und lebt in Andorf (OÖ) sowie Wien. In den stylischen Wurmkisten aus Holz leben Kompostwürmer welche geruch- und geräuschlos Biomüll in wertvollen Wurmkompost umwandeln. So eine Kiste kann man in die Küche stellen und als fahrbaren Hocker verwenden. Dort fressen sie den gesamten Biomüll. Was treibt Dich im Leben an? Spaß an der Arbeit, Herausforderungen und ein einfaches Leben. Wann hast Du genau dieses Projekt entdeckt? Es hat alles damals angefangen wie ich nach Wien gezogen bin zum Studieren. Ich war entsetzt von der Tatsache, dass Biomüll in den Restmüll landet. Mir ist es wichtig in kleinen Kreisläufen zu arbeiten wie es auch in der Biolandwirtschaft im Optimalfall praktiziert wird und da war mir einfach der Biomüll im Restmüll ein Dorn im Auge. Durch einen Mittagsschlaf bin ich dann auf eine Wurmkiste gekommen. Die Idee gibt es schon seit über 25 Jahren doch ich habe sie für mich neu entdeckt und war voll begeistert. Es dauerte keine Woche und die erste Wurmkiste war gebaut <U+0001F642> Wieviel Leidenschaft und persönlicher Begeisterung steckt in der Wurmkiste? Es ist mein Baby. Das ist natürlich auf der einen Seite gut, weil man viel Leidenschaft und Liebe hineinsteckt. Jedoch manchmal kann es auch zu viel werden. Des Öfteren ist es dann präsent beim Essen mit der Familie, beim Fortgehen mit Freunden und in meinem Kopf. Da ist es wichtig auch Abstand zu bekommen. Sport und Ausflüge zu machen. Ein unausgeglichener Geist kann nicht fokussiert arbeiten. Hat es dafür einen bestimmten Auslöser bzw. Grund gegeben? Biomüll im Restmüll zu akzeptieren ist eine moralische Frage. Er gehört einfach dort nicht hin und Menschen die eine Wurmkiste haben sind auch begeistert von ihren neuen Haustieren. Bei mir kam anschließend die Erkenntnis, dass ich weiß wie man Wurmkisten baut, wie man gesunde Würmer sicherstellen kann und wie man es optimal präsentiert damit die Menschen lange eine Freude daran haben. Auf einmal war ich “Wurmkisten David” und bin auch happy darüber. Die Wurmkiste ist ja auch Teil von Kreislaufwirtschaft. Wie wichtig ist dieses Thema für den urbanen Raum? Der urbane Raum bekommt praktisch alle Ressourcen von außen. Autarkie gibt es keine. Ob bei den Lebensmittel, Energie oder Wasser. Da wird es natürlich immer wichtiger unabhängige Kreisläufe zu bilden. Dass Wien alle Lebensmittel nicht selbst produzieren wird ist mir schon klar. Doch in Havanna klappt es ganz gut. Eine andere Motivation steckt bei den Kubanern dahinter aber technisch wäre es möglich und das ist wichtig. Was sind denn das so die größten Ängste, Zweifel die dir begegnen? “Stinkt das nicht?” ist wahrscheinlich Frage Nummer 1 gefolgt von “Stell dir vor alle Würmer kommen raus und sind in der Küche”. Bei beidem kann ich Entwarnung geben <U+0001F642> Wie schauen mögliche Entwicklungsstufen aus? Wie schauen deine nächsten Schritte aus? Ich bin derzeit im Prozess hineinzufühlen was optimal für uns ist. Auf der einen Seite möchten wir das Thema Wurmkompostierung Menschen näherbringen, was Wachstum bedeutet und anderseits möchten wir nicht in diese marktüblichen Abhängigkeiten fallen wie Kredite, Verkaufsprognosen für die nächsten 5 Jahren einhalten zu müssen, eine Werbeagentur beauftragen,… . Wahrscheinlich wird es ein Spagat werden müssen. Welchen Stellenwert nimmt das Themenfeld Entrepreneurship bei Dir ein? Es ist an sich ganz spannend doch interessieren mich das Arbeiten mit Holz und das Züchten von Würmern mehr als Bücher zu LEAN-Start-Ups zu lesen. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Stylische Wurmkisten die auch als Sitzhocker funktionieren <U+0001F642> Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Meistens in der Nacht, wenn ich alleine in der Werkstatt bin und an neuen Prototypen bauen kann, Versuche mit dem Wurmkompost anstelle oder mit Ideen herumspiele. Das ganze Gepiepes und Geblinke untertags, wenn Mails zum Beantworten sind und Fragen auftauchen lässt keinen Raum für die Leidenschaft. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Oftmals auf das Treffen mit Freunden oder einen gemütlichen Abend mit meiner Freundin. Es hält sich alles jedoch im Rahmen. Was mir auch viel Zeit erspart und mir eigentlich gar nicht abgeht ist Alkohol zu trinken. Sonntag Früh ist eine gute Zeit. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Das Schönste ist natürlich schwierig herauszupicken. An einem ökologisch sinnvollen Produkt zu arbeiten und die immense Lernkurve die ich seit dem Start erfahren habe sind die beiden schönsten Aspekte meiner Arbeit. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Ganz klar meine Freunde. Ich bin sehr dankbar dafür. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? In den Kompostwürmern steckt so viel Potential um gleich mehrere ökologische Probleme unserer Zeit zu lösen und irgendwie fühle ich mich bereit mit ihnen gemeinsam ihre “Talente” für die Umwelt zu nutzen. Würmer können nicht nur Biomüll zu hochwertigen Humus umwandeln, sondern auch kontaminierte Böden reinigen. In diese Richtung wird es auch gehen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Themen zu begeistern? Das Potential der Würmer begeistert an sich schon. Wenn jeder Mensch 1000 Würmer in einer Wurmkiste hätte gebe es keinen Biomüll mehr und alleine diese Idee fasziniert schon mal. Und außerdem sind es feine pflegeleichte Haustiere. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Sie finden es ganz gut und fiebern richtig mit. Falls mal Not am Mann ist helfen sie auch gerne mal mit und das zeigt, dass sie auch begeistert sind. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Eine ¼ h Spazieren in der Früh und ein paar ruhige Minuten sollten sich immer ausgehen im Tagesablauf einzubauen. Der Tag gewinnt immens an Qualität. Hast Du einen Wunsch? Dass viel mehr Menschen ihre Leidenschaft entdecken und diese auch leben. Es wäre zu schade Geld und Verpflichtungen nachzulaufen. Ein einfaches zufriedenes Leben mit einer spannenden Arbeit hat Qualität <U+0001F642> Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …?

Sie kommt aus Salzburg und lebt seit 2003 in Wien. Während eines Europäischen Freiwilligendienst in Madrid entdeckte sie ihre Liebe zu Europa in all seinen Unterschieden. 2009 veröffentlichte sie während ihres Studiums in Wien das Buch „Servus, Bussi und Baba – und was Europäer sonst noch ‚typisch österreichisch’ finden“. Nach Stops beim Österreichischen Außenministerium, dem British Council London und dem Europäischen Forum Alpbach, wagte sie sich 2015 ans Unternehmertum und gründete ihre eigene Agentur MOSAIK: Der Name steht für viele einzelnen Teile, die ein großes Ganzes bilden – so wie Europa. MOSAIK setzt sich mit unkonventionellen Produkten und Projekten für eine positive europäische Identität ein. Nach dem Storytelling-Kartenspiel zu Europa KOMM ZU MIR!, arbeitet sie aktuell an dem Großevent “Route28 – die Europareise mitten in Wien”, das am 6. Mai 2017 in Wien stattfinden wird und Europa für einen Tag in die Stadt holt. Nebenbei schreibt Katharina Artikel und Kolumnen für unterschiedliche Zeitungen. Die Agentur “MOSAIK – European Communication Projects” wurde 2015 gegründet und entwickelt Produkte und Projekte, die eine europäische Identität stärken sollen. Beim Storytelling-Kartenspiel zu Europa KOMM ZU MIR! hat man mit skurrilen Fun Facts zu europäischen Ländern Spaß an Europa. (Aktuell auf Deutsch, Englisch und Französisch erhältlich). Neben Route28, sind Projekte, die in Kooperation mit MOSAIK entstanden, die Motivationsbroschüre für Jugendliche in Europa “Who, if not us?” oder die Deutsch-Lernplakate für Flüchtlinge Wallpaperforrefugees. Was treibt Dich im Leben an? Die große Freude, Dinge zusammen zu bringen, die sonst in dieser Konstellation nicht zusammen wären und die gemeinsam etwas Neues ergeben. Mit motivierten und inspirierenden Menschen arbeiten zu können und gemeinsam etwas zu kreieren. Und eine Art Grundvertrauen ins Leben und die Menschen. Wann hast Du genau dieses Projekt für Dich entdeckt? Beim Mittagessen mit einem Freund vor gut zwei Jahren. Er hatte mitbekommen, dass ich mich schon lange mit dem Thema Europa beschäftige und wir haben uns gefragt, warum wir uns eigentlich europäisch fühlen und was das ausmacht. Die Antworten waren sehr persönlich. Da geht es um Erlebnisse, Geschichten, Menschen. Darum, dass man im Ausland gelebt hat, auf Reisen war, sich verliebt hat, andere Sprachen gelernt hat, sich in der Fremde zurechtfinden musste. Daraus ist die Idee entstanden, dieses Erlebnis auch Menschen zugänglich zu machen, die nicht so viel unterwegs sind – indem man die Reise in ihre eigene Stadt bringt. Das war der Anfang von Route28. Warum ist es MOSAIK geworden? MOSAIK hat mir irgendwie unter den Nägeln gebrannt. Es war und ist mein Versuch mein Leben kreativer und eigenständiger gestalten zu können und meine Zeit und Energie in Projekte zu investieren, die für mich – und hoffentlich auch andere – sinnstiftend sind. Was fasziniert dich denn so an Europa? Ich war schon immer angetan von der Idee, dass viele kleine Elemente, die an sich sehr unterschiedlich sind, gemeinsam ein stimmiges Ganzes ergeben können. So sehe ich Europa auch. Was mich an Europa daher schon immer fasziniert hat, waren die Unterschiede. Schon allein in Wien braucht man ja nur ein, zwei Stunden fahren und schon ist man in komplett unterschiedlichen Ländern, Sprachräumen, Kulturen. Wenn Du Europa hörst, was sind da so Deine Gedanken, was kommt Dir da in den Sinn? Viel. Am besten lässt es sich wohl zusammenfassen mit dem Motto der Europäischen Union – auch wenn es mir wichtig ist, zu betonen, dass ich mit meiner Arbeit nicht die EU erklären oder promoten möchte, sondern die ihr zugrunde liegende Basis der europäischen Identität stärken will. Aber ja, “Vereint in der Vielfalt”, trifft es in dem Fall am besten. Gibt´s für Dich einen typisch europäischen Platz in Europa? Ich glaube, Europa liegt so viel näher als wir immer glauben. Ich schreibe regelmäßig über Spuren europäischer Länder in Wien. Und in den meisten Fällen muss man nicht lang suchen. Sei es die venezianische Tapas-Bar mit dem herzlichsten italienischen Besitzer, eine urige polnische Spelunke mitten im 15. oder die Pub-Quizzes in einem der unzähligen Irish-Pubs. Europa liegt weniger an einem Ort, als in unserem Blick, den wir dafür öffnen müssen. Erzähl uns Deine drei ganz persönlichen Wünsche für Europa? Mehr Interesse aneinander. Mehr Empathie füreinander. Mehr Kooperationsbereitschaft miteinander. Wie schauen so die nächsten Schritte mit MOSAIK aus? Am Samstag, dem 6. Mai stellen wir die Route28 – Die Europareise mitten in Wien zum ersten Mal in dieser Dimension auf und wollen unseren TeilnehmerInnen die Möglichkeit geben an insgesamt 15 Länder-Stationen europäische Länder hautnah zu erleben. Du bist ja mit Deiner Initiative im Impact Hub angesiedelt. Was fasziniert Dich so an der Arbeit im Hub? Der Hub ist nicht nur Arbeitsplatz, sondern auch Support-Netzwerk und inzwischen sogar Freundeskreis geworden. Es gibt jede Menge Menschen im Hub, die mich inspiriert, motiviert oder unterstützt haben. Und auch ich teile meine wachsende Erfahrung immer gern mit den vielen kreativen und engagierten “Hubbern”. Bist Du ein neugieriger Mensch? Oh ja! Wozu sind wir auf der Welt, wenn nicht dazu, sie kennenzulernen, sie uns anzusehen, möglichst viel über sie zu erfahren? Zwei Dinge, auf die ich immer neugierig bin, sind Menschen und neue Orte. Ich mag es, mich in unterschiedlichen Kreisen zu bewegen und finde das Gespräch mit einer Klasse 15-Jähriger Berufsschüler genauso spannend wie ein Abendessen mit hochrangigen Politikern. Und neue Orte erfüllen mich selbst in Wien immer mit einem Anflug von Lebendigkeit – wenn ich durch unbekannte Straßen gehe oder Lokale besuche, in denen ich vorher noch nicht war. Dann ist mein Puzzle der Welt wieder um ein Stück reicher. Was würde der Welt abgehen, wenn es euch nicht geben würde? Die Route28? Das werde ich unsere TeilnehmerInnen am 6. Mai fragen und hoffe, dass ihre Antwort sein wird “Ein einzigartiger und unvergesslicher Tag in meinem Leben, an dem ich Europa tatsächlich ein Stück weiter näher kommen konnte.” Wo findest Du den Raum um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Dort, wo ich Menschen finde, die meine Leidenschaft mit mir teilen und sie mit mir gemeinsam umsetzen. Worauf verzichtest Du, um Deine Leidenschaft ausleben zu können? Auf das gute Gefühl, Freitag abends das Büro zu verlassen und in den wohlverdienten Entspannungsmodus umzuschalten. Im Moment antworte ich, wenn mich Leute fragen, wie es mir geht, meist damit, wie es der Route28 geht. Aber ich weiß, dass es im Leben unterschiedliche Phasen gibt und diese intensiven Arbeitsphasen auch etwas ganz Spezielles und Energetisierendes haben. Was ist eigentlich das Schönste bei Deiner Arbeit? Die Menschen. Beispielsweise mein Kernteam, mit dem ich im Moment die meiste Zeit verbringe und die mich zumindest zu Mittag von meinem Laptop wegscheuchen. Die unglaublich tolle Erfahrung, mit Menschen, die man einfach richtig gern mag, wirklich produktiv zu sein und dabei auch noch Spaß zu haben. Der Gedanke mit dem, was man tut, andere Menschen zu erreichen und ihnen etwas mitgeben zu können. Und die Menschen, die über die Zeit dazu kommen, und uns in dieser Vision unterstützen. Wer sind Deine wichtigsten und stärksten Unterstützer? Ich wiederhole mich, aber: die Menschen. Jede und jeder einzelne aus meinem Kernteam, der und die sich über alle gängigen Arbeitsvereinbarungen hinaus für dieses Projekt engagieren, weil sie selbst daran glauben und ein Teil davon geworden sind. Und die vielen Menschen, die uns dabei helfen, wie zum Beispiel die rund 50 Leute in unserem “Circle of Friends”, die uns am 6. Mai als Guides, Stationsbetreuer und Event Angels zur Seite stehen. Wer baut Dich auf, wenn es einmal nicht so klappt? Ich habe eine Handvoll an Menschen, die mich schon lange begleiten und meinen Kern ganz gut kennen. Die sind zwar von Sydney bis London verstreut, aber wenn ich um 3:00 Uhr in der Früh nicht mehr weiter weiß, gibt es dennoch Nummern, die ich anrufen kann. Das ist wohl eines der wertvollsten “Güter”, die man haben kann – gerade als Unternehmer, wo man im Tagesrhythmus mit Herausforderungen konfrontiert ist. Wohin wird Dich deine Arbeit noch bringen? Gibt es noch geheime Projekte? Irgendwann wird sie mich wohl nach Europa bringen. Im Moment hab ich ja den blöden “Fehler” begangen, dass ich mir Europa nach Wien geholt habe. Aber eigentlich hätte ich schon Lust wieder mehr zu reisen, herumzukommen, eben, mir die Welt anzuschauen – und letztlich auch die Route28 hoffentlich in andere europäische Städte zu bringen. Wie gelingt es Dir Menschen für Deine Themen zu begeistern? Die Frage der Motivation ist für mich eine der schwierigsten und ich habe oft Angst mit dem, was ich tue, allein zu bleiben. Was ich aber glaube, ist, dass Begeisterung begeistert. Und Authentizität. Darum versuche ich ehrlich mit dem umzugehen, was mich bewegt und freue mich über jeden, der einen Teil des Weges mit mir gehen will. Was sagen eigentlich Deine Freunde, Dein Umfeld, Deine Familien zu diesem Engagement? Ich würde sagen, dass ich ein sehr unterstützendes Umfeld habe. Das Wissen darum, dass Menschen an einen glauben, ist sicher eine der größten Energiequellen, die man im Leben haben kann. Hast Du Tipps für unsere LeserInnen? Na klar, schaut am Samstag, 6. Mai bei der Route28 – Die Europareise mitten in Wien vorbei! Gratis einen Tag lang europäische Länder in Wien erleben, gibt es so schnell nicht wieder. Es gibt noch Plätze unter www.route28.eu Hast Du einen Wunsch? Dass wir am Samstag, 6. Mai um 13:00 Uhr vor einem mit TeilnehmerInnen vollen MuseumsQuartier Hof stehen und ich nicht vor lauter Nervosität vergesse, ihnen eine schöne Reise zu wünschen. Hast Du für unsere LeserInnen eine Buchempfehlung, einen Web Tipp, einen Tipp für einen inspirierenden Platz, …? Eine Empfehlung in eigener Sache ist die Broschüre “Who, if not us?”, die ich gemeinsam mit elf anderen jungen Europäern geschrieben habe und die im Juni auf deutsch im Knaur Verlag erscheint. Und ein Buch, das vielleicht nie an Aktualität verliert, ist Stefan Zweigs “Die Welt von gestern”. Ja, ich glaube, das kann man gerade heute wieder empfehlen. Wen sollten wir noch für „way to passion“ interviewen? Jemand, deren Worte, Ideen und Taten guttun und inspirieren, sind die einer der wortgewandtesten Frauen, die ich kenne und die ich glücklicherweise zu meinen engsten Freundinnen zählen darf: Lena Raubaum.

"127","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/05/supporting-social-entrepreneurs-sustainable-eating/","ImpactHub","Supporting Social Entrepreneurs: Sustainable Eating","As social entrepreneurs we have a certain responsibility to the world. We need to lead the change and take charge of educating ourselves before we strive to make a social impact. This is why we all should look down and inspect the contents of our plates. Everywhere I look these days it seems that there is a new documentary or a book on sustainable eating. Everyone is telling me that I can look good, feel good, and do good just by eating. Despite all this information, I still had no real idea how to eat sustainably. Is sustainable eating vegan? Organic? Local? Farm to table? Gardening? When confronted with the myriad of options in the grocery store how do you make the best choices? Do you buy organic avocados from Spain? What about tinned kaferbohnen from Styria? Does fresh pork loin from Radatz count as sustainable eating? Do you, as a thriving entrepreneur, take time to examine how a box of out of season strawberries impact the world around you? What is eating sustainably? At its very core, sustainable agriculture means production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare (Source: Sustainable Table). This means that everything that lands on your plate is healthier, environmentally friendlier and created without compromising our ability to produce food in the future. Sustainable eating is supporting conscious food production by buying products – meat, eggs, cheese, dairy, vegetables, etc. in a responsible fashion. Meaning less food waste, more locally grown organic food, less packaging and educating yourself constantly about your actual impact. Dan Barber and Michael Pollan each present a working sustainable farm. For Dan Barber, a high-end New York chef and restaurateur, it is his family farm Blue Hills in upstate New York. Barber and his staff serve up creative and seasonal dishes from all the produce on the farm – and this includes the animals as well. Pollan, in The Omnivore’s Dilemma, presents Polyface Farm where the everything operates in a nutrient loop; the cows graze in the field, returning valuable nutrients to the soil, chickens remove pests and insects that cause crop failure and spread cow manure, later when the field is planted the crops grow better in the nutrient rich soil. This also means planting crops that are not monocultures, that are indigenous or grow best in the conditions, and using fewer pesticides and chemical fertilisers. Now, in both examples animals are part of the farm. This is because these organisms work together in nature. The most sustainable form of agriculture replicates the systems found in nature. If you think of a forest there are plants and animals and all of them work together to make a healthy ecosystem. That is what sustainable producers do on their farms. How to eat sustainably? So, sustainable eating means purchasing and making food that comes from these systems, farms, and producers. And this means educating yourself about what you find in the grocery store, markets, or anywhere else you shop for food. Obviously, the easiest way to do that is to speak with people. Strike up a conversation with the person selling your apples – find out what orchard they are from, who grew them, and how they farm. Gardening is also a very sustainable way to eat. You know exactly what you put in your window boxes, your allotment plot, or your share of the community garden. And you can ask yourself all sorts of questions about the herbs, cherry tomatoes, and gem lettuces that you are growing. If you do not think that your three pots of an indoor garden are enough, try building a living wall or a wall farm. There is a cool European manufacturer of indoor gardens called Click and Grow. Check out their website to see if their smartphone connected planters and wall farms are right for you. Eating more plants is good for you and good for the environment. In fact, prioritizing plants in your daily eating is a big part sustainable eating. Plants take less time and resources to grow than meat, eggs, and dairy. Other options for eating more sustainably are to: choose food with less packaging prioritize local products choose imported foods only when you know the people and the network involved choose foods that would normally have been wasted Will you be able to eat a perfectly sustainable meal each time you sit at your table? At first, no. It will take time to build the network and resources that are necessary to eat sustainably. Will it get easier over time? Yes, it will. Why does sustainable eating matter to entrepreneurs? That is a simple answer to a simple question. While you are out shopping and asking questions, you are helping entrepreneurs and local producers. You are helping local coffee importers bring in coffee from their family farms and local mushroom growers expand their market. So, let’s help each other out and use the ready-made network that we created here at Impact Hub Vienna to eat sustainably. You can learn how to prepare a sustainable meal by attending one of our weekly Tuesday events, Sexy Salad, which invites all Hubbers to bring their leftovers or fresh food and prepare a healthy meal together in the community kitchen. Check out our ‘Events’ section for more details. Who works in sustainable food? We found some businesses in Impact Hub that deal in sustainable food. Find out more about them and get inspired to make your journey towards sustainable eating easier! Iss Mich: makes delicious dishes from food that would have otherwise been wasted – like ugly carrots and misshapen apples. Check them out at Impact Hub Vienna. Hut & Stiel: grows mushrooms in coffee grounds from other local businesses. They are grown in the Vienna area and you would be surprised how many restaurants serve their tasty mushrooms. Lunzers: works with local suppliers and producers to sell food with reusable packaging. They have created a network of growers that you can tap into and start on your sustainable journey.

We read about them, we hear about them, we are influenced by them. Our wishes and expectations for them may differ heavily, but this doesn’t stop them from writing history. In recent years, the importance of being authentic as a leader is being constantly emphasized. But what does being an authentic leader really mean? We all have our different ideas on how an ideal leader should look like. These ideas are mostly based on our own psychological needs, character traits and skills. If we have high levels of anxiety, for example, we may feel the need to have a charismatic and authoritarian leader, who would provide some sense of security. Feeling a bit more confident may result in a wish to have a leader, who boats more humble approach, which in turn enables a rather collaborative environment. Even if these ideas contrast with each other, they are all shaped by our perceptions of the world we live in and by the life experiences we have made so far. Different leadership styles will meet different needs and they all come with their own benefits and disadvantages. How do these life experiences and perceptions occur? By taking chances! When we take in our life experiences and let our intuition guide us through them, we get in touch with our core-self. The more we experience and make mistakes, the more we find out about ourselves and what we really want in life. In this process, some of us will realize, that they too, want to take the matter into their hands and become leaders. By letting their intuition guide them, they will also be able to find their own authentic leadership style. However, authentic leadership is much more than just a style. It is based on a person’s character, it is based on the person as a whole. It may not make you the best leader, but it will enable you to stay true to yourself and honor the person you are meant to be in this life. At the Impact Hub Vienna, we feel lucky to have some of the most proactive and influential leaders as our members, who are striving to change our community for the better.This is why we decided to dedicate time to explore their experiences and learn from them together. In this upcoming series of articles, we will seek the answer to the question of how did our leaders at Impact Hub Vienna find their unique leadership style. We will ask them: What experiences brought the Hubbers to their current leadership style? How did they get in touch with their own intuition? How did their leadership influence our community?

"129","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/10/ecosia-plant-trees-as-you-search-the-internet/","ImpactHub","Ecosia: plant trees as you search the internet","There are many things that we do automatically every day and we never stop to consider their environmental impact. Take internet searching. Whatever the question, we first turn towards search engines to serve us multiple answers in milliseconds. Little do we know that searching does not go unnoticed in our environment. Have you ever wondered how much power and resources are required to serve the massive data centres of Google, Yahoo, Bing or other tech companies? For example, Google, the main ‘culprit’, which only last year hosted over 92% or world searches, entered ‘water wars’ last month when its thirst for 1.5 million gallons of water needed to cool down the servers was reported in a newspaper. Realistically we can’t unplug and start visiting libraries when in doubt, but does it mean that there is no green alternative to technology, which revolutionised our lives and made them (let’s say it out loud) tremendously more convenient? Luckily there is Ecosia. How Ecosia works Ecosia is an internet search company based in Berlin, which donates at least 80% of its surplus search ad profit (income after costs) to support tree planting initiatives around the world. It started in December 2009 and received a B Corporation status five years later, making it one of the 1600 companies around the world to meet the rigorous standards of sustainability, accountability and transparency by non-profit B Lab. Holding true to their words, in December 2016 Ecosia donated €137,000 which was 49% of its total income. €12,000 went to The Masarang Foundation in Indonesia, €15,000 went to The Eden Projects in Madagascar, and €110,000 went to Ecosia’s Tree Planting Fund, which is money that the company’s tree-planting partners do not currently need. The funds are reserved solely for tree planting initiatives and will be released when there is enough planting capacity. Due to Ecosia’s commitment to transparency, all this information is openly available on their website. You can read their monthly financial reports and tree planting receipts and follow their goal to finance the planting of 1 billion trees by 2020. Much needed alternative As one reads online about Ecosia, voices of scepticism appear here and there, challenging the view that bringing yet another search engine can be counterproductive to our goals of saving the environment. Yet, the prevailing opinion is that having a green alternative to internet search, a tool which we will definitely not give up easily, is a confident step towards igniting a sense of personal responsibility in socially conscious internet users. Despite Ecosia being way too far from offsetting the effect of 15 billion trees cut down each year, there is no debating that before Ecosia, there wasn’t any other alternative to Google that would be so dedicated to environmental causes. What can you do? If you want to contribute, it’s really simple. Switch completely or partially to searching on Ecosia. When you click on an ad or purchase something online, the company earns revenue. To use Ecosia on your phone, you can install the Ecosia App on your iPhone or Android. You can also add the Ecosia extension in your Chrome or Firefox browser. If this sounds like something you want to support, start searching and help plant trees! Impact Hub Want to receive updates when a new Impact Hub Vienna article is up?

Yet not every startup or entrepreneur uses this platform for marketing purposes to its full potential. With its recent features, such as carousel posts available to everybody and Instagram Stories, marketers are creating great content and getting great results. With over 400 Million people using Instagram worldwide on a daily basis, 70 percent of Instagrammers follow a business profile on Instagram. Taking under consideration that: over 150 Million Instagrammers use stories every day, over 500K advertisers use Instagram stories to drive business results and 75 percent of Instagram users take action inspired by a post, I do not know why you haven’t recorded your first Boomerang video yet. With this post we will give you a couple of tips on how to use Instagram to boost your marketing efforts and making the most of the platform. Keep on reading! Set up a business profile If you haven’t switched to a business profile on Instagram, do it now. All business profiles are granted access to Instagram analytics, can post to Facebook Business Page, and based on the contact information you included, can show easy access buttons for telephone, e-mail and directions to your store on your profile. This mean you can monitor how effective Instagram is in your content marketing strategy and if it is bringing you the results you anticipated. In addition, while business profile is not a requirement for creating Instagram ads via Facebook Ad Manager, having one gives the people you advertise to an opportunity to find out more about you without leaving the platform – Facebook adverts for brands, which do not have a profile on Instagram, do not have a clickable username leading to a profile page, which sometimes discourages users from seeking out information on the brand. Advertise on Instagram Instagram helps over 8 Million businesses reach their corporate goals. There are over 1 Million active advertisers each month, resulting in 80% increase in followers on Instagram for advertising accounts. Creating an ad on Instagram is very straightforward, fast, and easily done in just four clicks. And if your brand is targeting millennial consumer segment, then Instagram is the way to go. A study conducted by Pew Research Center revealed that 18-29 years old represent the highest demographic of Instagram, accounting for 59%. Source: Based on data from Pew Research Center, 2017 Photo ads Tell your brand story with beautiful, high resolution photos in square or landscape format. You do not even need a professional camera and equipment for quality pictures – all you need is your smartphone and a good light, the rest can be done with Instagram’s additional apps such as Layout and Boomerang – these features offer possibilities to post pictures and videos in different formats and try out something new every time. For example, Storets is a Korean online fashion company that attracted new customers through Instagram and Facebook photo ads promoting its unique fashionable designs. The company aimed its marketing efforts towards women aged between 20-34 worldwide. The campaign successfully achieved 48% increase in unique visitors, and increase sales by 4x as compared to their previous campaigns. Carousel ads This feature can combine up to add 10 photos and videos in just one post, allowing you to tell a story in a compelling way. Carousel ads enables the audience to view ads and swipe left to see more images, click on the link to a website for further information or a Shop now button that directly drives users from Instagram to your app or landing page. This creative feature lets you share your business experience from behind the scenes to a step by step tutorials showcasinng your product or service. Video Ads Using Instagram videos to display your products, ideas, and services is a great way to combine the power of sight, sound, and motion.Make sure you optimise the ad for muted viewing – add subtitles or text, which will encourage your audience to tap on the ad and listen to it. Diplom-Is is a Norwegian ice-cream company that used Instagram video ads to launch its six new flavours targeted at millennials. This well-recognized, yet a small-business company in Norway, reached out to six influencers and entertainers for the ad campaign. The influencers posted live videos on Instagram during the making of ads, which created a buzz even before the campaign officially rolled out. The series of Instagram video ads increased the brand awareness by 53%, ad recall by 34%, and generated 634,000 video views. Dynamic Ads Instagram recently launched dynamic ads which enables brands to market their products to the audience, who have browsed your website or mobile app. In other words, custom audiences. Several e-commerce and retailer businesses have used them to increase conversion rate and lower their cost per acquisition across each device. MeUndies, an underwear and loungewear brand, had success in increasing sales of its product line during Black Friday and Cyber Monday by using dynamic ads to retarget audience that had visited their website but not purchased. This resulted in 5x return on ad spend, 25% decrease in cost per purchase on Instagram, and 30% decrease in cost per add-to-cart action on Instagram. Stream live videos and tell stories Another excellent feature on Instagram, which you can use to connect with your audience, is Instagram Stories. Stories is an ephemeral video function, meaning that once you post the story it will disappear after 24 hours. In addition to that there is Instagram Live streaming option, great for showing how to videos, Q&A or just for checking in with your audience. Why you should be exploring Insta Stories? Because this year video content will represent 74% of all internet traffic (Source). What moreover, Instagram Stories give you the rare opportunity to share valuable content with your audience, run short promotions, publish content, which otherwise does not fit with your account’s style and show the backstage of your start up. Market Land revealed that “15 to 25 percent of the people who see a link in an Instagram Story are swiping on it, according to a handful of brands and publishers that have been experimenting with the feature.” The head of Digital Marketing of Mulberry said: “We’ve been early adopters of Instagram Stories and were impressed by the reach and engagement. Our recent campaigns which included a stories link, received 5x more clicks to site and engagement when compared to the average seen across our other social channels” UGC aka turning your audience into brand advocates In the past brand advocacy could not be measured as easily as it is today. By encouraging users to tag you and hashtag their photos of you/your product with a dedicated hashtag, you create plenty of free PR, which can be recycled to leverage your reputation even further. Ever heard of UGC, which stands for user generated content? You can both appreciate your faithful followers by featuring them on your accounts and also show other viewers that your brand is worth trusting and values its customers. With 88% of people trusting online reviews written by other consumers as much as they trust recommendations from personal contacts (BrightLocal), an Instagram post is nothing else but a visual representation of somebody endorsing your brand. Ask your customers to use your branded hashtag to easily find them and make sure your username is easily connected with your brand. You can also feature a fan of the month, repost users’ photos or create a graphic with your customer’s testimonial. Want to stay updated with Impact Hub Vienna?

"131","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/17/spotlight-wge-gemeinsam-wohnen/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen","WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen is establishing a model of shared multigenerational living in Vienna. They arrange and supervise shared living between elderly and young people enhancing mutual activities and support while keeping the rent lower than the market average. Their services include a platform for single and institutional clients. Marlene Welzl is in charge of Communications, Sales & Marketing for WGE! We chatted about how it all started, some of the difficulties the organisation has faced along the way, and the vision they have for the future. How did WGE! start? Marlene: It started with the idea of bringing young and old people together. We felt that there was a growing lack of interaction between generations so we wanted to create something that would foster intergenerational dialogue and solidarity leading to mutual learning and understanding. In order to put this idea into action, we identified some socioeconomic issues affecting the young and the elderly and thought about a possible solution. Young people from all over Austria and other countries move to Vienna to study–there are around 200,000 students here and they face rapidly increasing rent prices. At the same time, there are also elderly people who might need some help with daily activities or who just enjoy company, who live in big apartments and have a free room to offer. We put two and two together and WGE! was born. What brought WGE! to Impact Hub Vienna? WGE! started arranging mixed generation housing 18 months ago and we’ve gotten to a point where we feel that we’re ready to develop the organisation further. We applied for this year’s RE: Wien development program and were selected which is great because it gives us the opportunity to get different perspectives, to develop and improve our business model, to explore different sales and marketing strategies while also allowing us to tap into the existing Impact Hub community with all their talent and experience. We love the environment here. How do you find the RE: Wien development program so far? What does that mean for your organisation? The program is great! We’re in the third month and we’re all extremely excited. So far, we’ve taken part in acceleration workshops and have received business coaching. It’s also given us the opportunity to connect and collaborate with other start-ups. We’re a small team of 6 people and we all feel that we’re getting the support and the outside input that we need for WGE! to grow further. It’s just such a wonderful opportunity for the organisation.The program lasts for 6 months so it’s a set period of time and that means the next months will be an intensive period of development for WGE! By the end, we’ll be closer to if not exactly where we want to be. It’s a great incentive that’s motivating the entire team. Can you tell us about some of your successful projects? One of our clients is a 75- year old woman who lives in the 8th district on the third floor of an apartment building with no elevator. Managing her day-to-day-life became increasingly challenging, so her son got in touch with us to help find a suitable roommate for his mother. We matched her with a 30-year old young professional who is now happily living with her and helping her with her day-to-day needs. There is also a 55-year old single mother who works in Prague during the week. She lives in a big house in the 23rd district with her 16-year old daughter. While the daughter is fully capable of taking care of herself, the mother felt that she needed an older sister-like figure from a different cultural background so that there would be someone at home for the daughter to have conversations, breakfast and dinner with as well as have an intercultural experience. We arranged for a 22-year old student from Armenia who is studying English to move in with the family. There’s one more that I’d really like to share because he’s a really cool guy! He’s a retired professor of architecture in his early 60’s who has a 200 square meter apartment in the 4th district. He is now sharing his flat with three other students. It’s great because he enjoys being surrounded by young people and the students benefit from his professional and life experience. Everyone is very happy with their respective arrangements. Has WGE! experienced any major challenges? It took us some time to understand the needs of some of our clients, particularly the elderly, and the fact that every client has a unique situation. In order to address these issues, we are continually redesigning and evolving our services to provide better support for our clients. Developing the proper legal framework for our clients was also a significant obstacle to overcome. Finding the correct balance that benefits both parties while providing adequate security was a bit tricky. There is also understandably a greater demand for rooms as there are rooms available. This is the main challenge that we continue to face: finding open-minded people who are willing to offer a room. For some people who do have rooms, they are hesitant to allow a stranger to live with them, which we can understand. But we continue to push our message and try to find open-minded people because we believe, and from the feedback we’ve received from our clients, that this experience is worthwhile and enriching for all involved. For people who might be interested in joining WGE!, what are some of the benefits? The benefits for people using our services is actually everything beyond the living arrangement that we facilitate–it’s the environment and the experiences that are created when people from different generations spend time doing activities together and learn from one another. We help create this opportunity but it’s the people that create the magic that can only exist between them. Think about the retired professor of architecture that I mentioned before. He has a lot of knowledge and experience in his field and one of his roommates is studying architecture. She is learning a lot from him while she is helping him with IT. Another benefit of WGE!, especially for young people, are the lower rental costs. For example, WGE! is able to offer a 20 square meter room for less than €300 (all costs included) in the 3rd district. This is almost impossible to find otherwise. What would you like to see WGE! become? Our goal is for WGE! to become a sustainable social business that offers a viable alternative to the traditional housing market. Our long-term goal is to take our platform to the next level: everybody who is looking for a roommate, whether they just want some company or need some help in their daily life, can find the right roommate, and where everyone looking for a room can find comfortable and cosy rooms, regardless of their financial situation. It won’t matter whether you’re a private person or an institution looking for the perfect match. Through this process, we hope to create new communities who support and benefit from each other. What effect do you see WGE! having on Vienna and/or society at large? Our hope is that we create the opportunity for a greater understanding between generations. Our service is also designed to transform unoccupied living space into occupied living space, helping to reduce the need for new living space. Our hope is that this helps create a more sustainable housing market. We also would like to prolong the time that elderly people can live in their homes while also lowering the rental costs for young professionals and students. How can Impact Hub Vienna members help WGE!? Ask your parents or grandparents whether they would be interested in joining! While we are currently more focused on intergenerational housing, we understand that there are other living situations that merit our services as well. So if you happen to have a room and are interested in what we do, please let us know! Want to stay updated with Impact Hub Vienna?

We’re not just watching, we’re binge-watching. That’s how good TV is nowadays. It’s so good, you’re probably watching a TV show right now as you’re reading this. Hopefully, they’ll be one of the following 5 great TV shows for entrepreneurs. Halt and Catch Fire This show is a fictional retelling of the development of personal computer and the growth of the internet. It tells the story of Joe MacMillan, an ex-IBM executive who tries to reverse-engineer the company’s technology for his new firm, Cardiff Electric. Greed and ego affect all those involved as they try to give the giant of the computer industry some healthy competition. The Wire A seminal piece of television that over its five seasons gave a stunning portrait of the city of Baltimore. Learn how to deal with the law, politicians, and how to expand your empire. Yes, the empire in the show revolves around the business of drugs and crime but the lessons aren’t that dissimilar. Business is business, and it can be unforgiving. Silicon Valley Start-ups are all the rage and Silicon Valley clearly depicts all the absurdity and the surrealism that can be found in the start-up world. From the creator of the classic “Office Space”, which I remember seeing on its opening weekend in an empty theatre, Mike Judge turns his comedic focus onto the tech scene to show it in all its crazy glory. Black Mirror A great show, a compelling show, and a horrifying show of a very plausible future. A show that is great for the social entrepreneur because it clearly illustrates some of the ideas that we’re probably better off not pursuing. Whether it’s the ability to record your every experience or the social rating of you, the implications and consequences of these ideas are explored in fascinating ways. Every episode is self-contained so feel free to jump in whenever. Girlboss The newest show on this list, Girlboss is loosely based on the autobiography of Sophia Amoruso, who went from an eBay store selling vintage clothes to founder of Nasty Gal, a clothing retailer that at its peak was valued at $200 million. And she did it all before the age of 30! As much a lesson of what to do as it is of what not to do if you want to succeed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-U2G280kmI And there you have it. Five great shows, each of a different genre, that’ll give you lessons on successful and not so successful entrepreneurship. Want to stay updated with Impact Hub Vienna?

"133","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/05/30/socially-impactful-apps/","ImpactHub","7 Socially Impactful Apps","There are countless number of links you can find on the internet warning us about the possible side effects of smartphones and technology: social isolation, decrease in communication skills, decrease in sleep quality… But this time let’s focus on the apps that can make this world a better place. This is about technology done right. Too Good To Go You have probably heard of dumpster diving – collecting free fresh food that is thrown away daily by supermarkets – but what would you think if I told you there is a way to enjoy a great meal at a bargain price? „Too Good To Go“ makes this possible. Just like dumpster diving, the aim of this app is to help the environment and reduce food waste by enabling restaurants to sell their surplus food in eco-friendly takeaway boxes just before the restaurant closes. Download the app to see which restaurants are participating in Vienna or anywhere else your travels may take you. ProDeaf Mobile As the name suggests, The ProDeaf Mobile app is here to make communication easier between the deaf and hearing. The app provides you with instant translations from Portuguese to Brazilian Sign Language, or from English to American Sign Language. FiveApp Like the ProDeaf Mobile, FiveApp is also aims to support the Deaf community by providing a messenger that suits their needs. The Five CEO, Mateusz Mach, designed the app with the help of a group of freelance coders. At the beginning, Five was an app that lets you send custom hand signs and gestures to your friends, just like rappers do! With constructive feedback from the Deaf community and the cash influx from various venture capital firms, Mach was able to turn the app into something that has great social value. Charity Miles Walk & Run Tracker Did you know that you can walk your dog, and create impact at the same time? This app makes it possible for you to support charities while you are walking, running or cycling! Step by step, you will not only get fit, but also help create a society where more needs are met. If you want to turn your steps into money for charities too, all you have to do is start using this app. Talk about inspiration! Sea Hero Quest Finally, a game that fights dementia! Given the fact that it is very hard for doctors to differentiate between the symptoms of dementia and the symptoms of natural aging, this app helps create an anonymous database by tracking the navigational data you create while playing this game. As loss of navigational skills is one of the first symptoms of dementia, the game requires you to chase creatures around magical seas and swamps this is how it gathers information on human spatial navigation. The game makes it possible for you to have fun and contribute to the development of new diagnostic tools and treatments for dementia at the same time. Who wants to forget all those beautiful memories you made in life, after all? ShareTheMeal – Help children Hunger kills and this is what it takes to feed a child for a whole day: $0.50. This app by the United Nations World Food Programme gives you the chance to share your meal with a child in need. Although we have vaccinations for various deadly diseases, no vaccination can stop world hunger… but you can! Download the app to stop the suffering of hungry children. Peek Acuity If you are having problems with your eye sight, this is the right app for you. The app helps you measure your visual acuity and determine if you need any further examination by a professional. The app was created by eye care professionals, so it’s worth a try for sure!","May 30, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/socially-impactful-apps-600x400.png"
"134","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/06/impact-investment-rodney-schwartz-interview/","ImpactHub","Impact Investment- A Rodney Schwartz Interview","“Impact Investment is on the rise”, says Justin Fox in a Harvard Business Review article from September 2014. And according to the report on Impact Investment Trends carried out by thegiin.org, with numbers and data as recent as December 2016, Justin Fox was right! But what exactly is impact investing? Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to not only generate financial return but also a visible social or environmental impact. On June 22nd and 23rd, Impact Hub Vienna will host the CEE Impact Day. A conference that brings together Impact Investment players to inspire, connect and enrich the impact ecosystem within Central & Eastern Europe. Rodney Schwartz, an impact investment expert and the CEO of the UK based company ClearlySo, will not only be a speaker at the CEE Impact Day, he will also host a masterclass and be part of the panel. I had the pleasure to chat with Rod on a few of the impact investment topics and here are his thoughts on the matter. What was the first job you had out of college? How did that shape you to get where you are now? It’s not such a great story. The truth is that ever since I was young the expectation in my family was that I would go into the family business, so I had no expectation my whole life of doing something else. However, things don’t always go as planned and in December of the last year of my business school, on the 31st of December 1979, I remember vividly, I woke up and said “What the hell am I doing? I can’t do that, that would be crazy!” so I went back to business school and I said “I need a job!”. By that time almost all the interviewing had finished and there were only 3 interviews left: one was Marine Midland Bank and I was terrible in the interview. The second interview did not go well either (a chemicals firm) and then the third interview was with an investment bank called PaineWebber and I really liked the guy and I wound up working there. I hardly knew about the firm or the sector—investment banks were not as well-known as today! My first job was very interesting though. It was a job in the finance department of PaineWebber, where I was essentially a spy for the department: I was looking into different businesses we were involved in. I didn’t realise at the time, but PaineWebber was falling apart. I knew very little about the company, so I had no idea about what was going on and what they were trying to do. The way they were trying to get back control of it was by sending young MBAs like me into different divisions to get some information about the company and report back and make some suggestions as to how profitability could be improved. So my first job was kind of an internal spy at PaineWebber. And because I didn’t know anything about what I was doing, it was really fun. I think nowadays people just have so much information, they know so much about things, and they have such high expectations…. I was only expecting to work for my dad and I was just relieved to have any other job anywhere, doing anything, but the thing that was most important to me was the person I worked for and he turned out to be somebody who was kind of an alternative father figure to me throughout my career. Why did you choose impact investing? Yes well, a combination of guilt and age. Guilt for? Having been successful. I guess it was 1999 when I first started getting involved into impact investing, so I was 42. I have 4 children, and when your children get to be a certain age they ask better questions about why you do what you do and my answers were, you know, incomplete. Like every parent, you tell your kids things about life that you think are important and then they would ask, “OK and what do you do?”. I worked at Lehman Brothers, I worked at Paribas etc. And the growing gap between what I did and what I said was important was just getting to be very painful, so I wanted to do something that made me feel better about what I was doing–something that would make my children proud of me. There wasn’t impact investment as a field so it’s not like I chose to do “impact investing”, I just chose to leave investment banking and do something more socially useful and what happened in the process was that I came upon, and in some respects helped with the early creation of the impact investment community in the UK, together with many others. It wasn’t an industry yet, but I just had a strong sense that I was getting to an age where I wanted to do something that was more meaningful. Would you say you were there right from the beginning? From when impact investment started? It depends when you consider impact investment starting, but my journey began in 1999. And I know that the phrase “impact investment” was only developed in 2007 by the Rockefeller Foundation, because they claim credit, rightly so, for having invented the term. The reason is that Americans hate the word “social investment”. They couldn’t live with the word “social” so they had to create a new phrase. You know Americans have to own things, so they wanted to own this concept and the only way they could live with “social investment” was to re-brand it as “impact investment”. I wouldn’t say I created this field and anyway, you could say that high-impact enterprises go back to the Body Shop as the first very visible modern “social business”. You could also say the modern impact investment movement started with the steps around boycotting South Africa in the late 1970s – early 1980s when people did not want investment capital to support activities that were supporting the regime in South Africa. So that is really when it started and I have no responsibility for that. Can you tell me about your most successful venture? Your biggest successes and failures in the industry? Biggest challenges? The biggest success: The most successful high-impact business I got involved into was also the first. It is a company called JustGiving and they had a very simple idea, which was that they would help people to give money to charities online. In the old days you had to write a cheque and that was very expensive for the charities, because they would have to take the cheque and process it, send it to the bank. It was just a messy bureaucratic process and JustGiving would enable you to do this online…and that was really quite revolutionary. And I thought “Oh this is a really interesting thing, using the Internet to help charities.” Unlike a lot of other businesses at that time, it was, and still is run by 2 women (that is unusual in and of itself—there are too few female entrepreneurs): one was born in Pakistan and one was born in Belgium and they came together in the UK and started this great company. It started with about £5 million and now it is probably worth over £100 million, so it is very successful financially- but most importantly it changed the whole way charities raised money, it massively reduced their cost to fundraise – from 23% to 5% – and in the process they’ve raised over $5 billion for charities and that makes it the largest crowdfunding platform in the world. The biggest failure: In the early days of ClearlySo we wanted to create a business like JustGiving– that was our Motto, but the one thing that I didn’t want to do was investment banking- it was something I’d done my whole life and I thought I’d like to do something different. So I put a lot of my own money into raising funds and starting a company and all that- and there was just one failure after the other: we couldn’t raise a fund, it was just too early, nobody understood what impact investment was about, nobody would accept the idea that you could make money AND create some good, they thought you would either have to do one thing or the other, that you either had to do good or do well but you couldn’t do both at the same time. It wasn’t just one failure but a series of failures, trying to figure out how to help companies, that wanted to change the world, be successful. We tried to raise a fund and we failed and then we tried to raise another fund and failed, tried to offer consulting services and failed, we tried to do an online platform for fundraising- that failed, we tried to do a headhunting activity-that failed. From 2008 to 2011, we kept failing and finally I was running out of money so we met internally and started asking our clients (this was long overdue!), “Actually what do you really want?”. They said, “All this other stuff is great, but we won’t ever pay for it. We’d like you to help us raise investment”. The irony was that after years and years and years of not wanting to do investment banking, what ClearlySo became was an impact investment bank. So it was a series of failures because we couldn’t figure out what our clients, which are high impact enterprises, actually needed. What does a successful venture look like for you and your firm? How do you define success for the ventures you take on? Well, every venture that we take on has to generate a significant amount of social, ethical or environmental impact- this is an essential aspect of every firm we choose to work with, this doesn’t make it successful, it just means that if they aren’t about creating significant impact we don’t take them on as clients. Success is then, I’m afraid, all about financial success. It doesn’t mean that they have to be immensely profitable, some are, some are not, but they have to be sustainable. So a successful business is one that generates enough revenue so that they can survive on their own, without donations, without grants and without further investment. So all our clients are impactful – they should be both impactful and financially sustainable. What are the characteristics that you look for in the founding team? Well, they should have, I think, 2 things:A. One thing that a founding team needs to have is relevant track record in a relevant domain, so if they are in the consumer field they need to have had expertise in the consumer field; if they are in the alternative energy space they should have relevant experience in the alternative energy space. This isn’t a very sophisticated point to take, but they or some member of the management team or the board should have relevant domain expertise. If they don’t have that, it’s a bit crazy.B. A second thing they need to have- and this is harder to judge, they need to be functional as opposed to dysfunctional. You can tell when a team is working like a team and you can tell when it’s just a field full of individuals. A good management team is one where the individuals all work collaboratively to achieve more than what they can each do as individuals. Many teams on the other hand are dysfunctional: where they work against each other, where there is tension, where they are arguing all the time…That isn’t likely to lead to success. Can you identify any investor trends that have been developing in the last years? What do you see as emerging trends in the next years? In the beginning, people were investing a lot in things that sounded great and inspiring. So they went more for the inspirational ideas, ideas such as feeding the hungry and clothing the needy, ideas that would inspire you to think the world would be a better place. In the beginning there was a lot of hope and things that largely appealed only to the heart. Seven-eight years on people see that many of these ventures have not achieved their ambitions—some have failed. So now there is much more attention to the viability of the organisation – “Will it succeed or will I be wasting money that I could just give to charity if I wanted to give it away?”. So I would say that the main change that I’ve seen is one from “Aww, aren’t they nice” to “I think they can really make a difference and I think they can create something sustainable”. So I think investors are shifting from things that sound nice to things that can really be sustainable and make an impact. I would say that that is the biggest change. As more and more investors are getting into this, the businesses that offer good returns are easier to sell than businesses that don’t. Let’s be honest, if a company goes broke it doesn’t create any on-going impact. Many people used to think that impact and return were like a see-saw, so if you had more impact you had less return and if you had more return you had less impact – but that is baloney. The things that are most successful like JustGiving, generate the most impact, and the things that are less successful generate the least impact and why? Cause they went broke. So impact and return are positively correlated and investors are starting to figure that out. How do consumers see the shift? Consumers pay on average 27% more on fair-trade good than they do for other goods that are exactly the same from a value standpoint, e.g. chocolate or coffee. So obviously consumers are willing to pay even it if isn’t a better product, consumers are voting with their wallets and saying, “I care about demonstrating my ethical preferences”. The evidence is clear. The point is that companies that are in sync with the way the new generations are thinking are going to do better and they will get into less trouble. Think of Volkswagen for example, it’s a perfect example of a company that behaved in the old world way and there was a time when people thought they were going to go broke. You have to adapt or you’ll die, no matter how big you are. What is the one thing that you would like to tell every impact venture/ impact investor? I’m just really trying to spend my time doing things that are useful and fun and I think frankly everyone should do that, because if you are not doing that you are just wasting your life. Really. Especially the fun bit. Some people care about making the world a better place, some don’t. That doesn’t bother me. I’d rather that they don’t make the world a worse place, but I think that you should do what is fun for you, what is in your heart, what is your passion. Probably if you do something that you are passionate about you will be doing it well and probably if you do it well you’ll be ok financially. But not to do something that you feel passionately about is tragic. Not as tragic as starving and all that, but we always have to get our perspectives straight. Just because you are an impact venture does not give you the excuse to be incompetent, sloppy or lazy. You still have to be professional and commercial in how you go about things. It’s even more of a reason for you to be commercial and practical because you have much more at stake than just making money, you have beneficiaries at stake. So there is even more riding on what you do and a greater need to take what you are doing seriously and behave professionally. A lot of impact entrepreneurs torture themselves with questions like what is my carbon footprint and what about my supply chain and when they worry so much about everything under the sun they are going to let their businesses run aground. Instead, just recognise that with one venture you cannot solve all the world’s problems. Just think of the one that you are going to solve and solve that. For impact investors, I really do believe that doing good helps you do well financially and that any extra angst that you have around things is offset by how much better you will do by doing well. I think you will get a reward for doing good things.","June 6, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Impact-Investment-A-Rodney-Schwartz-Interview-600x400.png"
"135","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/09/spotlight-conversation-klaudia-bachinger-wisr/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Klaudia Bachinger of WisR","WisR is a networking platform that matches job-seeking, talented elderly people to young entrepreneurs and innovative employers. The goal of the project is to re-integrate the elderly into the working environment, facilitate experience sharing, and bridge the generation gap. Klaudia Bachinger is the founder of WisR and she is really active. If you are a frequent visitor at the Hub, chances are you have seen her hustling about. She took time out of her busy day to talk to us about how her venture came to be, the obstacles along the way, and the vision she has for the future. How did WisR start? Klaudia: WisR started with an idea, which was to create a platform that pairs elderly people, who still want to work and have a lot of knowledge, with young innovative companies, who need that knowledge. The goal is to re-integrate skilled elderly people into the working environment and enable a knowledge and expertise transfer to the next generation. I believe that this is something that is missing in today’s society. I told one of my best friends about the idea and he said, “That’s a great idea! Go do it!”. WisR was selected to be part of the RE: Wien development program. How do you find it so far? What does it mean for WisR? The program is great! We’re in this wonderful group with other startups and we’re all exchanging ideas, which has been fantastic for WisR. The experts and mentors that are part of the program have also been incredibly supportive. They are giving very helpful insight on how we can get to the next step. What are some of the difficulties WisR has had to overcome to get to where it is now? I feel that there are difficulties every week or every two weeks–let’s just say, there’s a lot of ups and downs in starting your own venture but I’d have to say the greatest difficulty so far has been finding the right team. Finding the right people who share your vision, who complete you on both a personal and professional level, and who are willing to jump into the entrepreneurial world has been a challenge. Many people in Austria are understandably not prepared to give up their steady jobs and a certain standard of living to work in a startup. The other big challenge is that WisR is a two-sided platform–we want to fulfil the needs of both groups at the same time. That can be difficult in reality. Let’s say we have a highly skilled senior with a particular expertise. It’s entirely possible that in our current portfolio of companies, there’s no need for that skill and vice-versa so we’re working hard right now to fill those two talent pools to increase the number of both seniors and companies in order to increase the chances of a match. Who should join WisR? What kind of people are WisR looking for? We’ve got two sides. The elderly and the young innovators. So on the elderly side, we’re looking for people who are future-oriented, who want to share their experience but are open to learning new things, who like innovation, and who are interested in connecting with young people. On the company side, we’re looking for startups, innovative companies, companies of any size who are open to the idea of benefiting from the skills and expertise of underutilised elderly people. What would you like to see WisR become? I’d like to see WisR become a community and an inter-generational movement, where people start rethinking the concept of age, and where ideas, knowledge, wisdom, and experience can flow back and forth between generations. Like I said before, this is something that is lacking right now. As I was growing up, it was perfectly normal for multiple generations to live in one house and there was more of a connection between the young and the old. People are now moving away, living alone in large highly populated cities where it’s easy to become anonymous and isolated. While people might think that it’s only the elderly who are isolated, there is however an increasing number of young people who feel the same. This is why I’d like to see WisR become a community, not just to connect skilled people, but to have these people come together, making the world a less lonely place. How can Impact Hub members help WisR? Approach us if you’re looking for a specific skill or somebody, who can support your venture! Or if you are a freelancer looking for support in whatever way!

Over two months later after Impact Hub Vienna’s birthday party celebrating the 7 years of its impactful existence, we invite you to relive this momentous event with us. Please, feel free to exclaim ‘What a wonderful party that was!’’ now and then while reading this post. We kicked off at 16:15 opening the doors to members and their friends. The usual working buzz was replaced with light-hearted conversations and occasional shouts of ‘Place it there, please!’. Tabletops were set up with delicious cakes courtesy of the multi-generational cafe Vollpension, and sandwiches buffet prepared by Brotpiloten using unsold bread, which – despite being still a tasty treat – would have otherwise landed in the trash. At Impact Hub Vienna we party socially-impactfully. As the party unwound around us, conversation flowed and Iss Mich! kept serving alcoholic beverages and soft drinks, you occasionally got a stranger poke you to ask one of the random questions from the Impact Hub Party Bingo. You laughed unabashed about your IHV shenanigans (‘Have you smooched somebody at the Hub?’ following by knowing smiles) and parted friends. The pre-party atmosphere is the perfect setting to be introduced to what Impact Hub members were up to. We set up a small Members’ Market where you could buy scarves that tell a story from Younited Cultures; talk bloody things with Erdbeerwoche and see sustainable sportswear developed by one of the Impact Hub employees, Sophie Thalhammer, who established Fitico Sportswear. After visiting zimtfilm’s little movie studio, you could learn more about going on a yachting trip with Dominik Sarapata from Naleia Yachting International, support multi-generational housing WGE! and try on a unique shirt from mamamu by Magdalena Muszynska. Impact Hub did not forget about making the shopping more fun than it regularly is and each visitor could do one at each stand to get a free drink. Oh, Impact Hub, you know us so well! At 6 pm we were treated to a beautiful and moving piano concert by Matthias Lichtenthaler and everyone stopped and stared. This was probably the only moment in the history of the Hub when it was filled with so many people and still, you could hear a pin drop. A precious moment to treasure. What followed was a combination of hilarious, moving, inspiring and simply historic – we heard emotional talks of gratitude and gratefulness from the top of IHV, our director Matthias Reisinger, as well as Simon from aWATTar, Laura from CARamel, Ahmad, a former host and now part of the IHV team, Katharina from Route28, Gabriela and Betti from Impact Hub Global and Nikolaus, one of our experts and the Co-founder of the Investment Ready Program. They shared their personal Impact Hub stories and magical moments. See for yourself! By the way, you can watch the whole stream of the speeches here. All of us will also never forget this rendering of one of the best moments on British TV – think self-confidence, sweet dance moves and walking in on your father giving a live interview, adult version. After we recovered from what felt like being a victim of a collective ROTFL condition, we returned to mingle and chat, eat delicious food, visited the market couple of times, and had our photos taken in the most unexpected moments. The night went on to the rhythms of music played by B3 und Ulrike Tisch and we celebrated the 7 years cycle together like the family we, Impact Hub Members, are. Special thanks to zimtfilm for taking this video at the party and streemed for setting up and running Facebook Live Stream so those, who couldn’t be with us in person could still be with us virtually. You can view photos from the event on our Facebook page. ","June 12, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Party-like-its-Impact-Hub-Viennas-7th-Birthday-A-Recap-600x400.png"

"138","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/14/spotlight-talking-sustainable-fashion-fitico-sportswear/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: Talking sustainable fashion with Fitico Sportswear"," While fair fashion is increasingly in demand and the awareness of responsible wardrobe becomes more evident in today’s customers shopping patterns, new sustainable brands come across variety of challenges in a bid to establish themselves. Sophie Thalhammer, the founder of Fitico Sportswear, a sustainable performance clothing brand for sports lovers, would know a thing or two about that. We met at the Impact Hub Vienna accidentally during an event organised there (a common occurrence) and after a short conversation, I knew I wanted to find out more about entering the demanding realms of fashion industry when one is a complete newbie in the field. Sophie’s inspiring story is a testament to the support of people who believe in you and the drive to go one step further in making an impact being key to fostering growth. Photo courtesy of Fitico Sportswear What prompted you to create Fitico? I established Fitico because, first of all, I wanted to create something of my own. And I wanted it to be something sustainable,something to make the world a better place. Second reason – out of personal necessity because I am trying to live a sustainable lifestyle and at the same time I like to do sports. I realised that especially in sportswear there are not many labels operating in a sustainable way. How did you go from wanting to live a sustainable life to founding a brand? I mean, a lot of people say they are going to live more sustainably, which translates to ‘I am going to eat organic’ or ‘Buy more things that are not packaged in plastic’. So how did you decide to go a step further? Because I wanted to take it one step further and create more impact than just buy sustainably or make sustainable decisions. Secondly, you know you spend so much time in your work and your work is such an important part of your life, so I wanted to do something meaningful with my work, something that matters. How did you become interested in sustainable sportswear? Again, there are so many other choices for social entrepreneurs. Why did you choose fashion industry? Like I said, out of necessity because I couldn’t find sustainable sportswear brands I really liked. Also because the fashion industry in particular, and within the fashion industry especially the sportswear industry, is operating in such a horrible, harmful way. The factories are mostly sweatshops in South East Asia; workers there suffer from often inhumane working conditions. The companies don’t use sustainable materials or use very very little of them, and there is just so little environmental consciousness about saving resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that I thought I am going to start there and bring change in this specific industry. Tell me about the journey to establishing a social venture. First, you had the idea, what followed then… After I had the idea, I started talking to people, reaching out to people, to fashion designers, graphic designers, textile designers. Very soon I approached people from the industry: the material suppliers, the producers, the manufacturers, to get the basic idea of what I needed and what was possible. And then I also did a lot of research of course, on the Internet, about the fashion market, other sportswear brands, social media strategies – many different things. What were the most challenging parts of establishing your company? There were many challenges but so far I could overcome them all. To find the main material and the additional parts were the first challenges. Then the manufacturer. People in the industry say it is always the manufacturer that is most challenging when you try to create a new label. So that was quite challenging but in the end, I found one in Portugal and I am very happy, very satisfied with the cooperation. The next challenge is to enter the market. And to become heard and become recognisable because, as everyone in the fashion industry and sports industry knows, there are thousands of labels. It is not so easy to stand out. When we met at Impact Hub Vienna some time ago, you mentioned the challenges of entering the market. How is it going now, what are you doing to get people to talk about it? Well, the first priority right now is to establish a web shop and once in place I can start with all the marketing activities. Also, trying to bring people to the web shop. I still need to put more emphasis on social media. I think social media is really crucial for fashion in particular. Was creating your own sportswear more difficult than you thought initially? I would say yes, because I started as a complete beginner. I was new to the industry, I wasn’t working in fashion before, which, on the other hand I think is an advantage because I was not aware of all the challenges I would be facing. (laughs). I did face more challenges than I thought, there were more things I didn’t think of in the beginning. When those things come up, how did you deal with them? Did you do it singlehandedly or did you use support from people, who already had experience? Depends on the challenge. Some of them I had to refer to other people with more experience. In general, I think it always helps to talk to people, even to those who do not have experience in the industry because they can still be supportive. Sometimes I just talk to my boyfriend, or friends, or my family about a problem, and talking about it already helps a lot. Singlehandedly… Very seldom. In the end, I always try to solve problems in a team or through talking to people. Is sustainable fashion industry very specific? It’s very very different to the fast fashion industry, which is almost an industry on its own. Because the prices and the conditions are so different to all the other, smaller and bigger labels and the luxury labels. I think the sustainable fashion industry and the conventional fashion industry are not so different. And I also see the trend of the conventional fashion industry to go more in the direction of sustainable fashion. Photo courtesy of Fitico SportswearWhich sometimes is fake.. Sometimes, but some of them really make an effort. I can see mid-size labels putting more emphasis on the materials they use and on the factories they use. Also, becoming more transparent in their activities and trying to communicate to their customers that they do care. Your first collection spring/summer 2017 collection is reusing fishing nets… How did you come across the idea of using this material? I was looking for a sustainable material for sportswear and of course I came across organic cotton and Tencel [lyocell is a sustainable fabric, regenerated from wood cellulose.]. They are natural fibres which are good for the environment but sometimes not so ideal for workouts because they are not so stretchy, they don’t deliver the support you need, and they sometimes absorb the sweat. Then I found Econyl®, a material which is made of recycled fishing nets. This material had exactly the characteristics I was looking for. Abandoned fishing nets are regenerated into nylon which is then knitted into high-grade polyamide fabric, with a little bit of elastane added for compression. When you do sport you obviously sweat so you need a material that wicks sweat away from the body to help you stay cool and dry, a material that fits and stays tight with every movement and a lot of other requirements for sports. Especially for sports I do, which is Crossfit®. It was perfect, exactly what I was looking for. As a sustainable brand, what are the different challenges in conventional fashion, to get customers? I would say the biggest challenge, but not only for sustainable fashion but for everyone else except for the fast fashion companies, is to get the physical space in big shopping malls, big shopping streets. People still do most of their fashion shopping there and all they can find is fast fashion. Fast fashion brands are the only ones that can afford the rent so in terms of physical space that is a big challenge. Online… I think the challenge is to stand out, to become heard because there simply are so many fashion brands.Sometimes, people have to specifically look for the sustainable brands and this means a lot of extra effort. The online market places are full of conventional brands, and the ones who focus specifically on sustainable brands are much less known. How long have you been at Impact Hub Vienna? It’s exactly one year now! Do you think that being part of Impact Hub Vienna inspired you to go forward with Fitico? Definitely. As I said before, the people around you really matter and during this year at IHV I met so many interesting, inspiring people. It’s really amazing. Without that I don’t know if I would have always kept on going. What would be your advice for people who want to start their own socially impactful venture? First of all, go for it. And just try and start wherever you are. A friend once told me something, that influenced me a lot, namely that so many people think the idea is everything and you have to have a good idea to start. But the idea is only 10%. The rest of is the making. 90% is taking it forward one step at a time.

That’s right – you heard me. No giving up your beloved steaks. No skimping on heat in the frosty winter (well, you know, maybe eat just a little less meat and stuff). Just. Keep. Drinking. Collective Energy, a start-up in Vienna, is offering all wine lovers a chance to be a part of the renewable energy transition, one bottle at a time. It all started with two young Austrians, Julian & Christoph, and their passion for environmental studies at the Universität für Bodenkultur in Vienna. With complimentary Master’s Degrees in Environmental and Biological Resource Management as well as Energy Management and Environmental Politics, the duo came up with an idea to speed up the energy transition. Their motto? “Energie. Gemeinsam. Denken.” Or, Thinking of energy, collectively. After swapping ideas with multiple stakeholders, they developed a business model that could contribute to climate mitigation for generations to come. “The idea is that significant climate change mitigation is only possible through wide-scale, individualised contributions. Our model offers everyone the opportunity to take part in the movement towards renewable energy, which is ultimately necessary to the movement’s success.” Christoph told us. “With that in mind, if we make it so that people’s regular purchasing patterns can directly finance a business’ transition to renewable energy production, we’ve helped everyone in the process – big and small.” Julian explained. Their first project – helping a local brewery make the transition to solar energy production – was a big hit. The two then set up fort at Impact Hub Vienna in 2014 and, winning both the Social Impact Award for 2014 as well as the Social Impact Start Stipendium, were well on their way. You Get Fresh Air! And You Get Fresh Air! And You Get Fresh Air! Their model? Pre-sales crowdfunding with a goal: you help fund the energy transition today, and as a token of appreciation, you get locally grown wine delivered to your door for the next 5 years. Not a bad deal, huh? Take Walek Winery for example – one of Collective Energy’s three original projects. The Waleks live and breathe (and probably drink) wine. Their winery, home to their three children and nestled in Poysdorf (Lower Austria), specialises in white wine. Their latest project? Building a solar-powered cooling system for the warm summer months. Their challenge? Footing the bill for the photovoltaic cell installations. That’s where Collective Energy came in. “We set up their web page, threw fundraising events, consulted them on their marketing methods, and put together a system of pre-sales vouchers that enabled their customers – some regulars and others newly attracted by our campaigning efforts – to contribute to the costs of the PV installation in return for Walek’s specialty wine,” Julian told us. Then, Collective Energy connected Walek with local installers and providers, and next thing you know, Walek just financed their own transition to renewable energy through their most available currency – wine. In a matter of weeks after consulting Collective Energy, Waleks’s wine cellar was being kept cool by 30kWp of PV solar panels that would save an annual 8.4 tons of CO2 emissions for the next 25 years. Isn’t renewable energy magical? And the best part for us, the wine-lovers (besides prolonging the existence of the only planet that can sustain human life)? The packages offered are arguably affordable! For Collective Energy’s current project with Pölz, another family of Austrian winemakers on the green edges of Vienna, an upfront payment of 150 euro gets you 200-euro worth of wine delivered to your door once a year for five years. Or your best friend’s door. Or your mom’s door (is it too early for next year’s Mother’s Day present?). “It’s really about including everyone in this energy revolution – from students to wealthy businesspersons who harbour environmental concerns and an appreciation for local businesses,” Christoph told us. “The only way to effectively tackle climate change and pollution is, after all, on a wide scale. Every effort counts.” Moving Forward – Literally So what’s next? After collaborating with wine and beer makers thus far, Collective Energy will soon be implementing their newest adventure: e-cars! “At the moment, we’re setting up our first venture into e-mobility in Landshut, Germany. The model is similar – the local municipality and a local business cover the upfront costs of installing an e-car sharing hub, while the local community pays those costs back as they partake in the pre-sales e-car sharing scheme over the next years,” Julian explained. The result? An attractive and cheap e-mobility solution for the local community and local businesses. A higher usage rate and a lower risk for the operator. Less greenhouse gas emissions. More space for Landshut residents. Less car maintenance costs for residents. And an extra car always available for those weekend adventures that justified storing an extra hunk of costly, gas guzzling metal in the garage in the first place. “We still want to continue with smaller PV projects, but we figured e-mobility plans could really help out families in smaller cities and towns that have a 2nd or 3rd car they don’t really use that often but are reluctant to give up. Now, they’ll always have access to an extra environmentally friendly car, should they need it, without having to pay upkeep or store the car on their own,” Christoph told us. So, are you craving a nice, chilled, locally grown glass of Welschriesling and a strong gust of crisp, fossil fuel-free summer air yet? Well do I have good news for you!

"140","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/06/22/joadrehubcouture/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: HubCouture"," The Austrian Development Agency (ADA) called for a Social Entrepreneurship Challenge in December of 2015. The idea behind the challenge was to encourage the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in other countries through new ventures. 1 million euros in grants were allocated to the winners, who participated in workshops helping them develop their ideas for 18 months. The winners also pitched their businesses to Impact Hub Vienna recently as part of the ADA program and we caught up with one of them – HubCouture. We spoke with Joana Adesuwa Reiterer, CEO, and Pauline Kolm, Network Director, of HubCouture, to discuss how the venture started, the key lessons learned along the way, and the next steps for the venture now that the program at Impact Hub Vienna is about to come to an end. What made you start your venture? Joana: I had been supporting victims of human trafficking in Austria with my NGO, EXIT, for more than 10 years when I realised that there must be more one can do to prevent people from being trafficked in the first place. The strongest push-factor in regions affected by human trafficking is the lack of job opportunities and dire future prospects. If young people have enough money to take care of themselves and their family, and are able to see a bright and promising future, the risk of being trafficked diminishes so the issue is: how can we improve their livelihood? In these regions, there are many vulnerable people who have excellent handcraft skills and can make amazing products such as leather, fabrics, fashion, and jewellery. However, the problem is that due to structural and financial reasons, it is almost impossible for them to bring their beautiful products to the global market. So the solution to me was clear: I needed a platform that would directly connect these eager and dedicated producers to the consumers, which would then give them access to the global market. Today, I can proudly say that I am the CEO of HubCouture. What were the difficulties you encountered during your entrepreneurial journey? Trafficking is a complex issue and developing a business model that improves the lives of vulnerable people while generating the funds to keep the venture going was a significant challenge. Our platform is not one that will generate significant amounts of revenue in the first few years so finding financial backing is critical to get us from one stage to the next. On the long journey of setting up a business, you come up with many ideas about how to do better and what to improve. While working through these ideas, the easiest and cleverest way becomes difficult to grasp and you are unable to see the wood for the trees. The greatest difficulty for our team has been to stick to one solution, to believe and to fully commit, and to pull it off instead of trying to integrate too many ideas at once. What made you apply to the program? Two reasons: financial support and expert guidance. And I am happy to say that these are two things you surely get once you are accepted into the program. The goals of the program were exactly aligned with what we wanted to do. It gave us the space we needed to experiment and to properly develop our business. How has the program helped you? Thanks to the helpful guidance of the many experts throughout the program, we have been able to come up with a few ideas that are now firm components of our business strategy. What are the 3 key lessons you took out of the program? Pauline: Put your social impact in concrete numbers. How to pitch. It’s extremely difficult to get it right but so important. Good marketing strategies and specific business growth strategies. We’d also like to add that the community at the Hub is fantastic. Speaking with the other ventures during the program and listening to their difficulties, there’s a great sense of community here and it motivates us and keeps us going. What are your next steps after completing the program? Joana: We will continue working as hard as we are now. The fact that so many people are dependent on HubCouture makes the team want to be even more successful. We are excited to take HubCouture to the next level. What is your advice for somebody wanting to start a venture targeting the SDGs? Keep the focus on the social impact. Never forget why you started!

It can seem overwhelming given all the elements and resources that need to be organised. But organising a successful event? That’s a completely new level! Don’t worry, we are here to help with this list of 8 things to keep in mind to have people rave about your event management skills for years to come. In the photo: Impact Hub Vienna’s 7th Birthday Party #1 Make sure you understand the event Not all events are the same. Make sure that you understand the requirements of the event and provide what’s needed. Different events require different resources. A daytime corporate event will be different from a casual evening networking event. Know what your audience is expecting and work closely with key stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. #2 Work with reputable vendors There’s nothing worse than thinking that everything is going along swimmingly only to suddenly find out that the event you have carefully planned is going to be ruined by an unreliable vendor. To avoid the possibility of this even happening, you have to take the time to vet your vendors carefully. Ask around for referrals from people you trust, ask a vendor about guarantees, and/or if they can provide client references. Managing an event is hard work. Minimise your risk as much as possible. #3 Plan for the unexpected If you’re a believer in Murphy’s law, what can go wrong, will go wrong. Events, big or small, have a lot of moving parts and the unexpected can always happen. In order to not be caught off guard, it’s important to sit down and do a run through of all possible crisis scenarios so that you are prepared in case these things happen. Unforeseen issues always cause a panic because nobody knows how to react. Don’t let this happen to you. Have a plan and know how you’ll react. #4 Create a solid, reliable team You’re likely going to need help managing your event so it’s important to surround yourself with a good team. Assemble a team that you can trust and rely on because you will be relying on your team members to do their part while you’re managing the event. Support your team members and they’ll support you. Create the dynamic that you would want to be a part of. #5 Pay attention to the little things How’s the lighting? How are the acoustics of the space? What does it sound like with one person? What does it sound like if a hundred of people are all talking at the same time during a networking session? How’s the air-conditioning? Is anybody seated directly under a vent where it will be too cold? Even if you manage a successful event, people often remember the little things that rubbed them the wrong way. You can’t lose sight of the big picture, but by paying attention to the little things you will add that extra finesse that will take your event to the next level. #6 Get the word out What’s a great event if nobody knows you’re having one. With all the distractions that are available on any given day, you want your event to stand out and be place that people want to be at. There are different methods and approaches to choose from but whatever method you choose, you’ll want to target and get core supporters on board. Once they come, the network effect will kick in and others will follow. #7 Create a good positive energy We’ve all been to these kinds of events. Everything is going fine but nobody seems to want to be there. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that there’s a good positive energy flowing through your event. How do you do that? It starts with you and your team. You set the tone so make sure you greet every attendee with the positive energy that they can then convey to others. In the photo: CEE Impact Day 2015 #8 Select the right event space It’s essential to select the right event space. Would outdoor be more suitable to the event or indoor? Is it in an easily accessible location? Once you’ve selected a space, how can you enhance the experience of the event by maximising the potential of the venue? It’s not enough to simply find a space, you need to find the right space.

We were very frustrated and we just thought that there was a better way to work, and that that we could do it better so we started wir.agency to put our ideas into practice. We had no money but we were used to having no money since we were still students at the time so we thought, why not? It’s not going to change our lifestyle that much. We also didn’t have any experience of starting our own business so there was a lot we learned over the years. But, I think it was the best decision we made, which was to just go for it. How did you meet Thomas and why did you decide to work together? We met at Die Graphische. It’s a visual media college here in Vienna. He was studying Photography and I was studying Graphic Design. We started collaborating while we were in school and it went really well, which was a bit of a surprise because we were and still are a couple. There’s a lot of potential for friction but it works for us. Sometimes we have different opinions but we discuss it in a very healthy way. wir.agency specializes in illustration, animation, and video. At the heart of all these services is storytelling. What do you think is the most important element of an effective story? Thomas said something about this the other day and it was so succinct and perfect. He said that the most important element of an effective story is the emotional engagement of the viewer. They need to care about the story you’re telling. What are some of the difficulties wir.agency has had to overcome to get to where it is now? One thing that was quite difficult in the beginning that you probably wouldn’t expect was putting a monetary value on your work. We looked at our competition for some guidance but prices ranged from a student charging 400 euros for a two and a half minute video to a major agency charging tens of thousands for the same service. Where should we be on this scale? We then tried to estimate how much work would be required on an hourly basis but that guesswork was sometimes wildly inaccurate. With the hindsight of experience, we feel it’s about the value we’re offering the client so today, we offer packages. Small, medium, and large. It’s very clear what each package includes so a client knows what they will be getting. They can then assess which package best suits their needs. We feel it’s much better and fairer for both parties and it’s working out really well. Another difficulty, especially in the early stages of the agency when we needed the money, was turning down certain projects that we didn’t agree with. We were lucky in that we got a good number of requests, but some requests were for projects where we didn’t feel comfortable with the politics of the associated parties. Storytelling is a powerful tool and we don’t want to misuse it or use it for negative purposes. We feel very strongly about that. Cash flow was another issue. It’s always important to have some money set aside for unexpected expenses like a medical issue, or equipment failure, or the Ministry of Finance requesting something. It got bad enough where I had to take on a part-time job for a while to keep the business going. I was straddling two different worlds at that time: I was an employee and I was also my own boss. It was a bit strange. How do you approach a project? What are your first steps? The first and foremost step is to create a relationship of trust and honesty with the client. We are extremely client-focused and we want to do what’s best for the client so sometimes they want certain things but we ask them whether they need it. We help them find what’s best for their situation regardless of which package they choose. Sometimes it’s a smaller package than what they wanted because it’s not what they need. To me, fulfilling their needs is more important than the money. The next step is to form a communications strategy appropriate to the client. This could be one video or a series of videos, or graphic design elements–it’s all dependent on the needs of the client. Sometimes we provide a series of different versions and try them all. It’s not bad to try things out in the digital age to see what works best. There’s no harm done. I think this is a part of the process that is often overlooked. How involved is your typical client in the process? What are some of the things you do to guide a project to a successful end where both parties are satisfied? It depends on the client. For example, with clients that are new to online communications, we will involve them more in the process. As far as some of the things we do, we make very clear timelines, set strict deadlines, and we never miss a single one. It is one of our core values: to meet every single deadline. We take project management very seriously and we are very clear about what needs to be done, by when, and by whom. We make communication with the client an absolute priority so they know what stage the project is in at all times and when they need to be more involved. We also make a point to document all communications, requirements, feedback, and expectations so it’s clear to everyone what needs to and will be done. What would you like to see wir.agency become in the future? We are currently expanding and have created flexible teams to react more appropriately to different projects. I think this is an absolute necessity to compete in the modern age and it is probably the future of the creative field. This arrangement is built on trust and I’d like to see everyone trust each other more and be more honest. I would like to see wir.agency become the number one digital agency for trust and online communication. How can members help wir.agency? If you’ve got stories you want to tell, let us know. I love to collaborate and Impact Hub Vienna members are incredibly inspiring!

"143","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/07/04/spotlight-conversation-mario-milakovic-yugodom/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A Conversation with Mario Milakovic of Yugodom"," Yugodom is a stay-over museum that’s redefining the hospitality experience. Located in the heart of downtown Belgrade in the Dorcol neighbourhood, Yugodom gives visitors and locals the opportunity to travel back to the times and country that no longer exist: mid-century Yugoslavia. Mario Milakovic is the Founder, Designer, and Creative Director of Yugodom, and a member of Impact Hub Belgrade. He took some time out of his last days in Vienna to talk about how he came up with the idea of his venture, his experience at CEE Impact Day, the Investment Ready Program, and the plans he has for Yugodom’s future. Photo by Monika Pavlovic How did Yugodom start? Where did you get the idea for it? Yugodom is the result of a very natural process that started small and gradually grew bigger and bigger. It wasn’t the standard process of getting an idea, sitting down and writing a detailed business plan. It all started when I had just returned to Belgrade after living in Japan, and I had a spare bedroom, which I was unimaginatively using to store my bike. The apartment was a bit big for me, especially after having gotten used to living in a 13 square meter apartment in Tokyo. At the time, Airbnb was getting more and more popular so I thought: why not make a proper guestroom in my home and see what happens? If it becomes a success on Airbnb, great! If not, I would have a proper guestroom for friends and family. So I started to design the room. I didn’t have very much money so I focused on vintage things that I actually liked, which was and is still quite cheap and available in Serbia. When I was finished, and put the room online, people came! I got a lot of positive feedback and I also unexpectedly got some international media exposure, which led to more demand and that led the way to a second room, which was my room, and then the whole apartment. That’s when the concept of Yugodom all came together. And then I realised that the concept of Yugodom needs bigger space than what it is now so I got involved with Impact Hub. What’s your background? I’m a designer. I have a Bachelor’s in Costume Design and a Master’s in Cultural Studies and I love to do interior design so Yugodom is the coming together of all my interests. I’ve spent quite a bit of time abroad and I think that’s given me a different perspective on things. Why did you choose this particular period of history for Yugodom? I really like mid-century modern design. I think this period of design is just beautiful, natural, and significant. In Serbia, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is authentic given our history and we often only value things that are made abroad. I thought, why not focus on and value the things that are already here. We don’t need to always look abroad for high-quality objects, we have them already. Photo by Monika Pavlovic What is it about mid-century design that appeals to you? It’s the aesthetics, the functionality, and how the pieces are timeless. Even though they were made in the fifties and sixties in Yugoslavia, they’re still very contemporary. Things are not big or heavy so they can be easily moved around and rearranged. These objects fit incredibly well with a contemporary style of living. Also, what I really like about vintage finds is their ability to deliver a unique story of past times. Yugodom took part in the CEE Impact Day. What did you learn? What are your next steps? CEE Impact Day was the culmination of the Investment Ready Program that we’re a part of. It was an incredible learning experience, especially for me because since I’m more on a creative side, I don’t often think of the all the practical aspects involved when it comes to scaling a business so being exposed to those elements was very educational and worthwhile. The network of Impact Hub is also fantastic. I can’t overstate the value of being able to discuss ideas and to reach out to people when you have questions. It’s the crown jewel of the whole experience for me. For someone who’s just making steps into something new like myself, CEE Impact Day and the Investment Ready Program were amazing from A to Z. And the team at Impact Hub Vienna is so supportive and very lovely. As for the next steps, it’s all about scaling up and growing bigger. For that we need to find the right partner. Since hospitality is not the typical industry that people think of when they think start-up, some people get what we’re trying to do, and some people don’t. Therefore, finding the right partner is also another big next step–someone that shares the passion and the vision we have for Yugodom. What are some of the difficulties that Yugodom has had to overcome to get to where it is now? Since it was an idea that grew quite naturally, there weren’t that many growing pains. I just always took the next logical step. Plus, I’m a natural optimist so I tend to forget challenges after they’re solved. I guess the one thing that I’ve realized on this journey is that if I want to grow the idea of Yugodom, I will need to include other people. Even if I’ve been a solopreneur up until this point, if I want to grow, personally and professionally, if I want to spread this idea, it’s important to surround myself with the right team and have a network that I can reach out to and be there for others too, to support and to help. Photo by Monika Pavlovic How do you see Yugodom and your business model affecting society at large? The idea behind the business model is to promote the culture and history of a specific place while upcycling undervalued historical furniture and objects. The social impact and ecological impact we want to have is a core value of our business. In addition to this, we would like to employ a minimum of 30% of our workforce from marginalized groups. In Serbia for example, this would be the Roma people. So if you stay at Yugodom, it’s not just a place to sleep. You’re giving back to the community by helping preserve and celebrate culture while supporting progressive and inclusive work practices. I think it’s important to break stereotypes and demonstrate how ostracized groups are an important and underutilized resource of talent, capability, and potential. What would you like to see Yugodom become? First I’d like to further prove the concept of Yugodom by expanding it into a mid-sized boutique stay-over museum in Belgrade. Long-term, I would like to franchise the idea of Yugodom, which is to take the local history and character of a place, wherever that is, and recreate it in a stay-over museum that runs as a social enterprise. I want Yugodom to set the example of how the hospitality industry can be beneficial for everyone involved: the visitors, the locals, and the workers. In Serbia for example, some hotels are only for visitors and not for local people. I’d like to change that. How can members help Yugodom? I’m open to and very interested in all feedback and love discussing all aspects Yugodom so if you want to talk about it, please, let’s talk about it! And if you can, spread the word and check us out on Facebook and Instagram! And, of course, visit Belgrade and stay at Yugodom!

"144","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/07/07/sustainability-stay-viennese-perspective/","ImpactHub","Sustainability is Here to Stay – A Viennese Perspective","Time and again, Vienna ranks as the city with the highest standard of living. Yet, how does it hold up when it comes to sustainability? According to the World Economic Forum, we might not be the alpha of the pack, but still going pretty strong, coming fourth. Why? Of course, sustainable city policies play a huge part but what really shakes things up is the vibrancy of the Vienna start-up scene. Whether you are a tree-hugger or more of a pragmatic spirit, to most of us it’s clear that taking better care of our planet would essentially be a good thing. If it only weren’t so damn difficult without the right infrastructure and incentives. Fear not, because this is where sustainable entrepreneurs and their start-ups come in to save the day: new shops and projects keep popping up like mushrooms, which makes it increasingly easy for the environmentally-minded to turn their principles into practice. In this post, I will take you through Vienna’s inner districts, showing you that so much of what your green heart desires is already here. And rest assured – this is only the beginning! First district – Innere Stadt The first district synonymous with luxury, posh clothes and shoes. Fancy bars and restaurants. Yet, luxury doesn’t need to be a one-way street. With the growing number of sustainable restaurants, why not treat yourself while simultaneously indulging the earth for a change? Eating more plant-based is a delicious way to help save the planet. After all, animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of pollution and global warming. What better way to stand up for Mother Earth than relishing in the delicacies served at the many vegetarian or vegan restaurants of the first district? Yamm is exactly as yummy as it sounds. Many think it is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in town – I can certainly not argue with that. Whether for breakfast, lunch, coffee or after-work drinks, you will always find creative combinations that ignite fireworks on your taste buds. All of which include lots of fresh vegetables and herbs, sweet-dripping fruits as well as a rainbow of different spices. The vegetarian creations at Tian taste as delicious as the name of the restaurant itself: Tian means ‘heaven’ in Chinese. Maybe that’s because they get their ingredients come from their own organic nursery in Greifenburg. Their art of cooking even got them a Michelin star. While the price tag might be a bit hefty for a common day, it is certainly a wonderful place to go to on a special occasion. Alternatively, you could try their lunch menu, which tends to be a bit cheaper. Hidden Kitchen is also a hotspot for vegetarian and vegan lunches. It boasts daily changing scrumptious salad variations that will make you salivate just by hearing them: quinoa salad with yellow courgette, artichokes, lemon, arugula, and capers, or arugula salad with apricots, roasted walnuts and raspberry balsamic vinegar. Oh my. While we are at it, why not finish off with a bang? If you have a sweet tooth you will surely rejoice at the plant-based, organic treats sold at the Simply Raw Bakery. Considering that they are even made without added sugar, why not grab a second one – guilt-free of course! Second District – Leopoldstadt As you cross the Danube Canal to the second district, you enter the habitat of the nouveau hip Leopoldstädter. Whereas only a couple of years ago, this district was not too appealing to visit, now start-ups, coffeeshops, world food restaurants and of course, sustainable projects keep popping up in ever-increasing quantities. For instance, Lunzer’s Maßgreisslerei has made zero waste shopping easy. Fresh fruit and vegetables, milk, bread, cheese and meat are equally obtainable without packaging as shampoo and laundry detergent. No poor plastic bag had to die for your products here. Moving on from buying food to eating food: the company Iss Mich fights food wastage by using perfectly healthy veggies that did not meet aesthetic retail standards for their delicious organic vegetarian dishes. They offer a delivery service for those lazy days on the couch or catering for special events. Third District – Landstraße The sustainable entrepreneurs in the third district also care about zero waste living and battling wasteful consumerism. Similar to Lunzer’s Maßgreisslerei, the Warenhandlung Wenighofer und Wanits offers regional and organic pantry staples, fresh fruit, veggies, bread, meat and dairy without packaging. They thus play a pivotal role in making zero waste feasible in daily life. Because let’s be honest: how many third district dwellers will take it upon themselves to journey to another district for the sake of saving plastic if the standard grocery stores are just around the corner? Convenience wins. Now, with shops like this, sustainability finally becomes convenient. Once you banned plastic from your kitchen, next comes the bathroom. Package-free toothpaste? Eco-friendly lipstick? And not to forget plastic-free sanitary pads? These things are harder to come by. Unless you visit the cheerfully decorated Sonnengrün store, where all these products stand in rank and file next to tin boxes filled with chemical-free deodorant, beard balm or face cream. As if this weren’t already enough, animal lovers can even get soap for their pooch and a special cream for its sore paws. If you amble down just another street, you find a store dedicated to high-quality and skin-friendly eco-soap. Not all soaps were created equal – and the manufacture Wiener Seife makes, if you like, the queen of all soaps. For over 10 years, these sensual pieces for hair, body and beard have been hand-made using coconut oil as a basis. They protect the skin with the power of nature, devoid of chemical additives, mineral oils or preservatives. And boy, do they smell good! Thanks be to the natural oils, plant extracts and fragrance essences they use, many of which are from controlled organic sources. Bonus fact: Did you know that solid soap lasts you for much longer than liquid shower gels? Fourth District – Wieden Moving on from the beauty department to the fourth district, Wieden. Here you can find Gabarage, an upcycling design store, where trash gets a makeover. Ageing skis and snowboards, clothes hangers, bracelet and rings are given a new, stylish life. Old folders are transformed into trendy bags and escalator stairs arise from the dead in the guise of sofas. Nothing is thrown away. The team of Gabarage takes it one step further though. In the truest spirit of social entrepreneurship, they offer vocational qualifications and workplaces for disadvantaged groups of people who have a hard time (re-)entering the regular labour market. Fifth District – Margareten Quick, quick, moving on to the next district, because there is so much left to explore! Looking for a piano? An antique chest of drawers? A fancy armchair? A racing bike? A food processor? A drilling machine? A ballgown? Look no further than Margareten, Vienna’s fifth district. Here, you can find everything you need (and don’t need) in two fantastic thrift stores. Carla Mittersteig is the downtown branch of Carla Wien, a charitable organisation, where people can donate stuff they don’t use anymore. In four massive halls with 4,000 square metres, you can go on a veritable treasure hunt. Didn’t find that Egyptian belly dancing belt you so desperately needed? First let me say, I’m quite surprised because Carla really gives you the impression they stock everything. Nonetheless there is another equally fun thrift shop called 48er Tandler just a block away. They pick up items at the local dump, the lost property office and items no longer needed by employees of the City of Vienna in the name of waste prevention; vintage furniture, tableware, clothing, books, sports equipment and real bargains are then sold at the store. Their proceeds go to the TierQuarTier, the local animal shelter, as well as other charitable institutions, including a care and integration centre for refugees and a homeless shelter. Sixth District – Mariahilf So after you decided to buy that delightfully retro city bike you found at Carla Mittersteig, what are you going to do with it? Are you one of those people who abhor leaving their beloved bike in the courtyard of your residential building? Do you also drag it into your flat share on the fifth floor (no elevator) for fear of it being stolen? Then the Rad WG, the ‘flat share for bikes’ is what you need. The founders of this start-up realised the potential of empty ground-floor premises and turned them into regular bicycle parking spaces. For a monthly contribution, you can give your bike a safe home, instead of it being knocked over by that drunken student friend at one of your infamous house parties. In addition, the bike flat share is a space that brings bicycle lovers together. You might even find new friends at one of their bike workshops. That’s a bingo! Seventh District – Neubau Next stop, Neubau! Summer is coming and you need new clothes. You should definitely check out the many sustainable clothing stores in Vienna. Especially as stylish eco-fashion is no longer an oxymoron. Gone are the days when sustainable clothes looked like shabby potato bags. Today, not only do clothes make you look good, you can also feel good since you know that the factory worker behind your jeans got fair pay and the environment wasn’t harmed either. This is what I call a genuine retail therapy. There is a host of shops you can check out in the seventh district. At Combinat, they sell recycled fashion, at the ethical concept store ebenBERG you can find ladies’ collections, Zerum sells GOTS certified clothes, Maronski sells sustainable and fair fashion for men and women, Minimal sells children’s apparel, and at Rotknopf, the progressive gentleman of today can even get a tailor-made, GOTS certified suit that was produced under fair working conditions. The list goes on and on. Ethical, fair-trade, and ecological fashion retailers are sprinkled all over the city. Eighth District – Josefstadt Has the shopping tour worn you out yet? Sick and tired of buying ever-increasing heaps of STUFF? Sustainability not only means buying the right things, it also means buying fewer things. Luckily, Vienna already offers many opportunities for breaking out of the consumer-culture cycle. Are you ready for getting your hands dirty? In the mood for producing something yourself? Then maybe you’d enjoy joining an urban gardening community. Since May 2015, the Albertgarten in the Josefstadt offers you a social experience on top of crispy lettuce and crunchy carrots. By ballot, a motley group of people is brought together to tend collectively to one garden patch. At the Pfeilgarten and Tigergarten, a third of the yearly plots are dedicated to greenhorn gardeners eager to join the crew. Ninth District – Alsergrund If you have a hard timekeeping even your cactus alive, gardening might not be the most advisable option for sustainable consumption. This is where food co-ops might come in. They are a self-organised collective of people or households who source products directly from local farms, nurseries, beekeepers and so on. The food is usually seasonally, regionally, and ecologically sustainable as well as socially just. Food co-ops are more than healthy food choices. They are an expression of criticism of the current agricultural industry, characterised by polluting practices, mistreatment of animals, long transport routes and inequalities. The Kukuruz co-op is one of many in Vienna and is currently open for new members. Another way of escaping consumerism is the Open Bookshelf initiative. Here, people can leave their unwanted books for somebody else to enjoy for free. Do whatever you want: take them out, bring them back, love them forever. Anything goes, as long as you don’t sell them. That is just….not the point. And the last rule of sustainability is – never purchase what you can repair. Even if you aren’t an adept craftsman (or craftswoman), there are many options for mending instead of spending. In the ninth district, the Fahrrad.Selbsthilfe.Werkstatt will get your broken bike moving again – with 100m² workshop space, lots of spare parts, tools and people who can show you how it’s done. Cost factor: €4 for an entire afternoon’s use of the workshop. So after having come full circle on our sustainability tour through Vienna’s inner district, we are still nowhere near done. Why? First, because the initiatives listed in this post are only the tip of the iceberg – there are so many more awesome projects to check out in district 1 to 9. Second, because we only explored about half of Vienna so far. So if you are interested in what else awaits, stay tuned for part two of the Vienna sustainability series in which we’ll meet the eco-pioneers of the outer districts. We’ll get to know the team of Wohnwagon, who build off-the-grid and self-sufficient Tiny Houses on wheels in the 16th district. We’ll visit the boutique hotel Stadthalle in the 15th district, a zero-energy hotel with a lovely garden. In the 18th district, we’ll look at Good Goods who sell sustainable and affordable designer ware from sheltered workshops for the handicapped. See you next time!","July 7, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Sustainability-is-Here-to-Stay-A-Viennese-Perspective-600x400.png"

What is it that makes content worthy of the incredible power of viral word-of-mouth? If you want your idea or product to spread then this book will help you to do that. The author lays down six principles of content contagiousness, namely: 1. Social Currency 2. Triggers 3. Emotion 4. Public 5. Practical Value 6. Stories “By “contagious”, I mean likely to spread. To diffuse from person to person via word of mouth and social influence. To be talked about, shared, or imitated by consumers, coworkers, and constituents” writes Jonah Berger. Having your content go viral can be many marketers’ dream, and using the elements of contagiousness when crafting your next piece of content will help achieve your goal. #3 Connected: How Your Friends’ Friends’ Friends Affect Everything You Feel Think And Do by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler Christakis and Fowler describe the power of networks and their influence on various parts of our lives such as health, quality of relationships, politics, economy, emotion, and the digital world. We are unconsciously influenced by people around us. A social media manager should know the power of connectedness and how quickly an idea can spread through the crowd and influence people’s lives. #4 Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content by Ann Handley The soul of every social media marketing is the ability to write excellent copy.

The author puts emphasis on delivering valuable, exciting content while listening to your customers and prospects, and engaging them in order to spread the word. #7 Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman Understanding human behaviour is essential to improve your social media and create a lasting impression. Kahneman, a Nobel prize winner for his work on decision-making, explains how people go about decision making and why they engage in particular behaviour. If you want to persuade your customers by bringing up rational arguments, you might be missing on a very important aspect of decision making which is intuitive thinking. Kahneman explains how both intuitive and rational thinking works together to persuade your audience. #8 Purple Cow by Seth Godin The marketing icon Seth Godin envisioned Purple Cow to be the hands on guide to making a brand remarkable through innovation. He argues that the traditional way of marketing through advertising and distribution has become obsolete and that innovative ways of marketing are required to cut through the clutter of products and advertising. Godin believes that we are in a post advertising era where word of mouth works more effectively than plain advertising. And thanks to social media platforms reviews about products and services spread more quickly. As a social media manager, one needs to understand how to stand out in the crowded world of mass advertising and make their products and services more likeable and shared. Did you like this post?

She is a key member of WGE! Gemeinsam Wohnen, an organisation that promotes and facilitates mixed generational housing in Vienna. We chatted about what she loves about the Hub, what inspires her, and her love of Schwarzbrot. How did you find out about Impact Hub Vienna? Marlene: Actually, it’s a funny story, I’ve known about the Hub since the very beginning. 7 years ago, I was a student and a member of AIESEC which is the world’s largest non-profit, student-run organisation, and I attended a conference here at the Hub while it was being renovated. In fact, I’m actually in one of the pictures that’s hanging on the wall! It’s the photo where there’s a gathering of people sitting around and the photo is taken from behind so you can’t see anyone’s faces. I was sitting at the dining table the other day and was looking at the photo and had this sort of déjà vu and realised that it was me! I recognised my shoes! Where did you grow up? I grew up in Linz which is in Upper Austria. I grew up in an inter-generational environment which has greatly influenced my desire to be a part of WGE! My grandmother, who I’m really close to, lived with us for a few years and she’s been such a huge influence on my life. I’m pretty sure that one of the main reasons I have a good and disciplined work ethic is because of her. She always set such a good example. I learned so much from her and she in turn got a lot of joy out of taking care of me and going with me to the playground–it kept her young and it kept her healthy. I really loved the time I spent with her when I was growing up and feel very lucky to have had that experience. What do you love about Vienna? What’s your favourite spot? I love the mixture between the city and the countryside. Don’t get me wrong, Vienna is a metropolis which I do enjoy but you can also take the tram and be in the woods where you can go for nice walks surrounded by nature. I guess I like how accessible the countryside is which is important for me because I grew up in Linz surrounded by nature. My favourite spot in Vienna is a glade on top of Pötzleinsdorfer Schloßpark. There’s a terrific view of Vienna and it’s a great place to take some time and think. I go there when I have a lot on my mind. How did you get involved with WGE!? I’ve been involved with WGE! since almost the very first days of the organisation. I remember how I heard about WGE! very clearly. It was the day after I handed in my Master’s thesis during the summer. I was at an open-air swimming pool with a very good friend of mine when she told me about the idea for WGE! There was no doubt in my mind. I immediately loved the idea and wanted to be a part of it. Why did you become a social entrepreneur? I’ve always wanted a career where I would have a positive impact on society and social entrepreneurship allows you to do that. I like the independence that goes with it, how I need to be creative in solving problems, and the satisfaction of achieving goals that I know have social benefit. What do you love about the Hub? I like that the Hub is filled with like-minded people who are willing to support and help your project. I love the opportunity it offers me to improve my skills and to further develop WGE! I’ve also never left the Hub without having a fair amount of food for thought for my bike ride back home. You meet so many great people with so many different skills and talents and I love hearing all their different points of view. What are some books or movies that have inspired you? Stefan Zweig’s “Die Welt von Gestern” (The World of Yesterday). The book conveys an idea that I try to live by which is that you can’t just let things happen. You have to be the change you want to see. “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.” It’s not just because the movie is so thoroughly enjoyable and a lot of fun, but there’s this quote by Oscar Wilde in it that’s perfect: “Everything is going to be fine in the end. If it’s not fine it’s not the end.” “Little Miss Sunshine.” It’s hilarious and I love what it’s about: the most important thing is to pursue your dreams, whether you realise them or not. “Toni Erdmann.” I guess I like comedy-dramas so this is another great one. Again, I love the message of the film: focus on the things you enjoy in life and don’t get distracted by fulfilling the expectations of others. Do you get stressed? How do you cope with it? What do you do to relax? I do get stressed. Everybody does so I’m no exception. To cope with stress I like to do physically active things so I go swimming. When I do anything physical like gardening or sports, it helps clear my mind because I don’t think about anything, I just focus on what I’m doing. I also like going to the movies as opposed to just watching a movie at home or on my computer. I like the atmosphere, the audience, the big screen. What food can you not live without? Schwarzbrot. Especially from Upper Austria. It’s quite honestly one of the best things in the world. What else are you up to? I’m trying to develop some of my artistic skills. I absolutely can’t draw anything so I’m trying to learn how to draw. I’m also currently learning to play the piano. I’ve always wanted to learn, and I’ve been meaning to do it for a long time but it’s still kind of strange how it all came together actually. My grandmother had a piano that she no longer wanted and at the same time, my flatmate, who is studying to be a music teacher, was looking for a student. Perfect! Sign me up!

Practices were rained out. Schedules conflicted. But Rugby Opens Borders (ROB) didn’t quit until young boys and girls – refugees and locals – found new families on and off the pitch. How to Make Friends: Tackle Them In summer of 2015, people from all over the world were arriving at Vienna’s train stations. Some were escaping war-torn countries; others were seeking new opportunities for growth – but all were in need of a sense of belonging to their new city. That’s when ROB founder and player at Rugby Union Donau, Udo Richson, had an idea. “Rugby builds families.” He told me when we first met last spring. “You engage in a collective sacrifice for one another. There are no differences between you and your teammates – nationality, language, religion – it’s all the same on the pitch.” So Udo put together a team of individuals experienced in coaching, pedagogy, social work, economics, and media relations, and gave life to ROB – an organization aimed at integrating young refugees in Vienna. It does so not only through gathering refugees and locals on the pitch, but also around the dinner table, in the movie theaters, and in free tutoring sessions. In other words, the young boys who joined ROB had found their new family and, within months, ROB had gathered a team of committed young refugees who showed up for training at the Rugby Union Donau sports center in the Prater every week. Speaking German on and off the pitch so as to encourage linguistic development, ROB’s coaches have since taken on the role of mentoring the youth in their athletic, educational, and personal endeavors – a role that is arguably necessary for anyone in such formative years. Something is… Missing But there was a glaring gap in ROB’s model when I first met Udo last spring. “And the girls?” I asked. “We’re trying.” Udo responded, clearly having already noticed and been troubled by the fact ROB was missing a girl’s team. “But it’s not easy.” Getting the girls involved in ROB meant a different set of obstacles. For example, where many of the girls come from, their communities had told them that sports were only for the boys. For girls, playing sports, especially one as contact as rugby, was unusual. But noting that the girls already had schedules packed with yoga, football, skiing, and German courses, it was clear that trying something new wasn’t their main obstacle. “You could see the excitement on the girls’ faces when we were explaining ROB to them,” Ana Ruiz, or “Mini” as she goes by, told me. Mini has taken charge of ROB’s initiative to build a girl’s team in the last year. “They’re just children, excited to get out and try new things. So you could really feel that they wanted to get involved.” She told us of her visits to Vienna’s refugee centers, from where ROB’s young players are recruited. So where did their hesitance for ROB come from? “One of the biggest difficulties was recruiting enough girls so that the boys’ and girls’ practices could be kept separate yet substantive,” Mini told us. “When we proposed mixed training sessions, the girls were a bit hesitant to train together with the boys.” She recalled. “They were much more eager to establish their own team first.” So ROB worked towards establishing a girl’s team with persistence. “We just kept going to the refugee housing facilities and tossing the ball around with the girls. We picked the girls up for trainings, and we accompanied them from the facilities to the field. We showed them videos of women’s teams from their regions playing rugby to normalize the image in their mind. We supplied them with the necessary clothing to take part in trainings. We got their phone numbers to keep them informed on the dates and times of trainings and matches. We personalized the connection between us and them so that we were laughing and chatting whenever we did meet. And finally, we established separate practices for the girls so that the ones who were uncomfortable around the boys could have their own space.” Mini explained. “It was a process, but it worked!” Today, a team of committed girls consistently show up to training every week. Mini, who coaches the team alongside Sophie Koller and Charlotte Schönherr – all members of the Rugby Union Donau Women’s Team – helps put together fun, interactive trainings for the girls to build their skills while ensuring an enjoyable process of becoming a rugby player. And after each training, the boys, girls, men, and women of ROB get together over a meal cooked by ROB volunteers as laughs and smiles fill the room. Rugby & Ramadan As such, the girl’s and boy’s programs continue to grow both in numbers and cohesion with each month. Even Ramadan, which can be exhausting for some members who are fasting from sunrise to sundown, was seen as an opportunity to celebrate collectively. Rather than cancel the trainings, ROB moved them to the evenings, so that afterward, volunteers and members could break the fast together—a truly bonding experience. While the boys’ program won the 2016 World Rugby Award for Character and recently attended the United World Games in Klagenfurt, where they were able to play teams from all over the world, the girls’ team envisions a similar trajectory of success and recognition over the coming years. The next step is to incorporate the ROB girls’ team with the Austrian girls’ teams so as to further encourage integration and skills development. While the boys’ program has come so far in its relationships and success, the girls team is on its way to doing just the same. If people looking to create positive social impact can learn anything from ROB’s journey to where they stand now, it’s to keep getting up and moving forward, no matter how many times you get tackled.

Thanks to globalization, the rising trend of fast-fashion makes it easier for people to reflect their personal style by purchasing cheap and trendy clothes. People can browse clothing options from around the globe sitting in the comfort of their own home. But how often do we ask ourselves where our clothes come from, who made them, and how were they made? There is, of course, no harm in trying to look good. There is no shame in feeling better after you buy a shirt that fits you perfectly. The problem is that when we are not conscious of how our clothes were made, what type of fabrics were used, and who made them, we may inadvertently be supporting bad practices, unfair trade, child exploitation, animal cruelty, and pollution. And that is a big price to pay for a trendy outfit. The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world with one of the largest carbon footprints of any other industry. Harmful pesticides are often used in cotton farming and the waste created by clothing disposal is growing exponentially every year. So is there a way to keep your fashion on trend and avoid contributing to this harmful industry? Yes! The growing trend of sustainable fashion offers consumers an alternative to the harmful fast-fashion products. Several local entrepreneurs in Vienna have based their business on their belief that fashion can be sustainable without human and animal exploitation. Here are a few of our favorite retailers selling sustainable fashion in Vienna. Green Ground Located in Porzellangasse 14-16, Green Ground sells “organic fashion that does not look like eco fashion.” While many organic fashion stores sell clothes that seem more “hippy” and not as on trend as clothes you would find at Zara or H&M, this store focuses on selling stylish and chic clothes that fashion-forward consumers will love. Featuring many sustainable and fair trade brands such as Coccoon, Brainshirt and Green Bomb, if you are into modern designs this is the place to be. Zerum Located in Kirchengasse 13, Zerum is a store with high-quality standards and totally sustainable. They offer Bio-shirts, bags made with recyclable materials, bio shoes, fashion for men, women, and children. Everything green and made in Austria. Kakao Another store that is worth mentioning is Kakao, a children’s clothing located in Strozzigasse 25. Like the shops previously mentioned, their clothes are all made of organic cotton, which in case you didn’t know, benefits farmers, traders, retailers, consumers and of course our precious environment. So join the conscious-consumer movement and give sustainable fashion a try! About Daniela F. Lazo Daniela F.

But in the pursuit of building a customer base, we shouldn’t forget the importance of customer satisfaction. Getting people to buy is critical. But getting people to buy, and then buy again, and to encourage friends to buy is fundamental to long-term success. As your company grows, it is important to measure customer satisfaction and recognize how high customer satisfaction which results in customer retention puts you on the path towards profitability. Customer satisfaction through customer service is not a vague or abstract concept—it is tangible and measurable. When products are recommended by friends or family, people are 4 times more likely to buy it. Customer satisfaction is essential for referrals so in order to ensure a high-level of customer service in your organization, make it an integral part of your company culture. Save money The cost of acquiring a new customer vs. retaining a customer varies between 4 to 10 times. However you’d like to look at it, it always costs more to get a new customer than to keep one. The right balance needs to be struck between the two and it is worth looking into what works for your company. Measuring and allocating the appropriate resources and implementing customer satisfaction strategies will save you money in the long-term by increasing customer loyalty while decreasing customer turnover. 6 customer service essentials It starts with your company culture. If you don’t make top-quality customer service a part of your culture, you won’t get the customer satisfaction you’re looking for. It’s as simple as that. If you’re looking to improve your customer service, it’s important to do the following 6 things. Ensure that you’re clearly conveying the value you provide customers. Make sure that your employees understand and can accurately describe the benefits your company offers to current and future customers. Talk to your customers after the sale. Check in with one of the most important parts of your business and create a feedback loop. Get on the phone and ask them about their customer service experience and whether they are satisfied. Did you meet or exceed expectations? Use what you learn to optimize the relationship. Take your customer relationship to the next level. Be the solution to not just one of your customer’s problems, but all of them. Work with them to understand their goals and try to align your products accordingly. If you can become integral to their business strategy, they will be a lifetime customer and they will open new opportunities through referrals and organic promotion. Their success will be your success. Invest in your employees. It’s not just about the customers. This Harvard Business Review study said it best: “Profit and growth are stimulated primarily by customer loyalty. Loyalty is a direct result of customer satisfaction. Satisfaction is largely influenced by the value of services provided to customers. Value is created by satisfied, loyal, and productive employees.” Go beyond culture and make it a key performance indicator. Evaluate customer satisfaction at least once per quarter. Get feedback through surveys and interviews instead of just reacting to problems. Be proactive instead of reactive. Set clear goals on how to consistently improve customer satisfaction and make it part of your growth strategy. Conduct an exit interview. Not every customer stays onboard. They leave for all kinds of reasons but it is important that you understand why. Can you identify any trends from leaving customers? Is it a cost issue or something you overlooked? This may be the best time to get critical and honest feedback. It may be difficult, but don’t miss this opportunity to improve your business. It’s never too early or too late measure and improve customer service and customer satisfaction. Following these steps will allow you to reap the rewards of high customer satisfaction. It is essential to the long-term viability and success of your company. Remember, acquiring new customers is a skill. Retaining them is an art.","August 21, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/StockSnap_6BUTCIEUN6-600x400.jpg"

Karin Lachmann is one of the creative leads at wir.agency, a design agency that specializes in visual storytelling. Karin took time out of her busy day to sit down and talk about where she grew up, her life, french fries, and how she handles a lot of work. Where did you grow up? I was born in Linz and grew up in the Mühlviertel. I actually grew up in the middle of a forest. There were three houses and a bunch of trees surrounding us so it was quite literally in the middle of a forest. My neighbors were a bunch of boys around my age so we were the gang of this really really small community and I was the leader! We cycled around the forest and were explorers. That’s how we spent our days. We were free to do what we liked until sunset. During my rebellious teenage years, my family actually ended up moving to Linz and I founded a manga club that had 150 members! It was a lot of work. This was before Facebook so coordination was basically going through a long list of mobile phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Unfortunately I had to end it when I moved to Vienna. What are some of the difficulties you had to overcome to get to where you are now? There were some issues growing up once I got to school. My mother is Filipino and it’s interesting how I didn’t know I was different until I went to school. My gang of friends from the middle of the forest never treated me any different but then I got to school and the bullying started because I looked different. It also didn’t help that there were only 6 girls and 24 boys so I got even more bullying due to the gender imbalance. Those times were very hard because I was an 8-year old girl and I looked different but it did toughen me up. When I was 12, my father passed away. He was a tinkerer. He built his own boats and taught me how to sail. And he was very interested in CB radios and built his own. His call sign was Whiskey Lima. Whiskey for Walter and Lima for Lachmann. When he passed, that was a very difficult time as well and quite suddenly, I had to grow up really fast, and raise my two younger siblings with my mom. As for professionally, I always wanted to work in the creative world. My dream was to become a fashion designer and that’s why I moved to Vienna, to study fashion. My dream was crushed when I was rejected by the school so I guess it wasn’t meant to be. So I retreated to my manga interests and studied Japanese studies and graduated with a Bachelor’s. But I didn’t give up on my creative dreams. I applied to Die Graphische to study Graphic Design because I always loved to draw. I got rejected. Again. Dealing with all this rejection was difficult because at first I just felt absolutely worthless. I put so much pressure on myself and all I wanted was to get into the school. But, after many tears and now with the benefit of hindsight, I think these setbacks were good. It gave me time to reflect about what went wrong. With fashion, I think my heart wasn’t in it–I just didn’t know what else to do and I think they felt that in my application. For Die Graphische, they told me that I wasn’t right for the school and I learned that while I love to draw, and while drawing is important in graphic design, it’s not everything. My first portfolio submission was only illustrations. I had to adapt. So I learned other important graphic design elements like composition and typography. I reapplied to Die Graphische and was accepted. Finally! Do you still want to become a fashion designer? Now I do fashion just for myself so I’ve made my own backpack and my own pants. It’s more of a hobby. Sometimes, out of broken dreams, you can create hobbies! How did you find out about Impact Hub Vienna? I found out about Impact Hub through Creative Mornings. It was an event and it was at the Hub. I really liked the space and thought it was beautiful. Good lighting, bright, and everyone is so nice. It took me a while to sign up because my creative process isn’t the most mobile. I need my own creative space that is set up the way I need it to be. What do you love about Impact Hub? I love the community, the space, the events, and the location. Everything! What do you love about Vienna? Do you have a favorite spot? I love how Vienna is the perfect size. It’s the perfect size for a capital. You can run into people you know on the street but it’s big enough to give you the anonymity of a big city. There’s a lot of events, lots of things to do, and I feel you can find your community here, whatever that may be. My favorite spot is the main library, the Hauptbücherei. I don’t know how many hundreds of books I’ve borrowed over the years. There’s a borrowing limit of 25 books at any one time but I reach that limit almost all the time. I also love the restaurant on top, OBEN. They have great food and it’s an amazing view. What food can you not live without? French fries. Or what I’d like to call “frittierte Sonnenstrahlen” (fried rays of sunshine). I’m not the originator of that term–I just read it on Twitter and really like it. What are some books or movies that have inspired you? The Harry Potter series. Both the books and the movies. I don’t know how many times I’ve read the books or how many times I’ve watched the movies. It’s definitely a lot. When I’m down, I watch them and they pick me up. Since I’m a huge fan of manga, “Dragonball”. I think both this series and the Harry Potter series have helped shape my outlook on life. There’s light and dark in people. Bad characters always have the opportunity to do good if they choose the right path. Vegeta in Dragonball. Snape in Harry Potter. I’m also a big fan of Studio Ghibli movies. “Princess Mononoke” is my favorite. It’s got everything and again, everyone has darkness and light in them and it’s about what people choose to do. During busy times, how do you handle an above average workload? I try to get work done early in the morning so I get up at around 5 or 6. I go to bed at around 10 pm so don’t think I’m the type of person who doesn’t need sleep. I get my 7 to 8 hours. There’s just something about that time in the morning, you can’t hear anybody on the street because everyone is still asleep, and it just works for me. I get a lot done! Do you get stressed? What do you do to relax? I get stressed just like everyone. To relax, I watch Harry Potter. It’s my go to. It really does relax me or I go do something physically active or meet up with friends. What else are you up to? I’m naturally curious. I always want to learn and I always think I don’t know anything so right now I’m really into audiobooks and I’m listening to Elon Musk’s biography. There’s also a couple of other audiobooks that I’m currently listening to: “The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck” and “Sapiens.” Fascinating! I’m also involved in skillsharing. I’ve always got something to do!

"151","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/08/28/accounting-essentials-entrepreneur/","ImpactHub","Accounting essentials for entrepreneurs"," It may not be the buzziest or the sexiest thing about running a business, but when you’re starting out, it all boils down to euros and cents. Accounting requires an attention to detail that either bores people to tears or sends them running for the hills screaming the word ‘outsource’. But having some fundamental accounting knowledge and knowing what the numbers are telling you is a must for entrepreneurs–it will allow you to gauge the financial health of your company and understand how numbers affect how people see your business. Most companies operating in the European Union are required to prepare financial statements. Many of these companies need to prepare financial statements according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These standards are developed by an independent body based in London called the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). You will need to check with your respective national business register to find out exactly what to file and how to file it. These standards are what certified or chartered accountants use to create reports. Understanding these concepts can only help your business going forward. Separate business expenses from personal You might be tempted to fudge the line between these two but it is important to keep them separate. Unless you’re extremely adept at taking a deep dive and spending weeks sorting through both business and personal expense records at a critical time when you have everything else to do, start off on the right foot and keep it separate. You may not be able to see it now but it will pay off in the long run, especially if you need to go through an audit. Time period principle Set defined time periods for your reports and be specific. Usually, reports are monthly, quarterly, or annually. Once you have established your reporting time period, make sure to include a header indicating the time period covered by the financial statement. For example, a cash-flow statement could have the heading: “For the month ended June 30.” Since balance sheets indicate a snapshot in time, the header would state: “as of June 30.” Revenue recognition Many people think that revenue is only earned when the money is in your bank account. In accounting, revenue is different from cash. Revenue can be recognized when you earn it. As an example, if you sold a product or a service in January and issued a net-90 day invoice term, the revenue from the sale would be recognized in January even though you may not get paid until April. Alternatively, if you got paid in advance, you wouldn’t recognize the revenue until you delivered on the contract. This concept forms the basis of accrual accounting which is mandated by the IFRS. Expense recognition and the matching principle Expenses are recognized similarly to revenue–they should be recognized when they are used regardless of when you actually spent the money. In addition, with regards to the matching principle, expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they are related to. Say you spent €5,000 on a project now that will only deliver revenue next year. You would recognize the expense next year, even though you already spent the cash. Or let’s say you had to invest a lot of money in new equipment. That large expense can be recognized over the projected life-span of the equipment. This can help smooth out your financial statements to reflect how your business actually runs. Regardless of how you feel about numbers, these are some of the essential things you should know about accounting. In the beginning, when you have fewer transactions and they are for the most part straightforward, it’s generally clear what’s what. But as your business grows and your financial transactions become increasingly complex, look into taking on a CFO who has a proven track record of financial expertise or consult a professional accountant for advice.","August 28, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bookkeeping-615384_960_720-600x400.jpg"
"152","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/04/spotlight-conversation-myounghee-jo-building-brand-generate-new-business/","ImpactHub","Building your brand: A conversation with Myounghee Jo"," Myounghee Jo has been working as a graphic designer for over ten years. She has worked with numerous clients throughout her career ranging from Fortune 500 companies to local artists. But to get to where she is today as a well-respected independent freelancer, she had to build her own personal brand from the ground up. Jo was gracious enough to take time out of her busy schedule to talk about the importance of building your personal brand, the problems she faced along the way, and her growing desire to express another part of herself. How did you start building your personal brand? My personal brand is something I had to discover through a long process that took several years. When I first started, I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was constantly questioning myself. What am I doing? Why am I doing this? I think that’s true of a lot of people so I’m no exception. I needed to find out who I was and what I thought was important. How did you go from there to where you are now? It all came together when I did my Master’s Degree in Graphic Design Communication. What resonated with me was how through the work that you do, it’s about the story behind what you’re doing, how you communicate to others, how you present yourself to others, and how others see you. Another thing was something one of my first managers said to me which was that when you design something, you always need a reason. There’s a truth to all of it. Once I figured this out, I was ready to start building. How did you find your first clients? When I first started, it was very different to how it is now. Now you can quite easily design a website and leverage social media channels such as a blog, Instagram, or Facebook to reach potential clients. Back then, when I first started, it was before social media. I was printing things out on paper, showing people, and trying to get feedback. While this method helped in the early stages, pretty soon after, it was clear that a website would be the best way to build my brand, showcase my portfolio, and demonstrate what I can do. I also applied for tons of jobs at agencies and entered a lot of competitions just to build up some experience and meet people. What standards and values do you associate with your brand? Kindness. Being kind is extremely important to me, whether it’s personal or professional. Honesty, is another one. Being straightforward and clear with what is to be expected. Perfectionism. I want everything to be perfect so when I say I want to do this, you’re going to get complete and total commitment from me from beginning to end. And through this work ethic, I’ve earned a lot of trust with my clients who come back and tell their friends and associates about me. Was there a time when your brand wasn’t resonating? How did you re-position yourself to generate new business? Having developed my brand in London, it worked a bit differently compared to here in Vienna. When I moved here, it was difficult to find clients. In London, people don’t hesitate to contact you and take a chance on you if they see your work and like it. It’s more open; people reach out and there’s a response. Here, you have to know someone. It’s more a referral system. People trust other people more than they trust the work itself. If a potential client sees your work and likes it, if they don’t know someone who knows you, they won’t contact you. So, here in Vienna, networking is extremely important. You absolutely have to leverage your network to find new business. What tips do you have for anyone who is in the process of building their personal brand? You should take the time to find out what you really want to do and what you want to show others. Find the parts of yourself that you want to share with the world and build off of that. It might sound a bit abstract but it’s really not; you can even do something as simple as writing a list: things you like and things you don’t like. Strike out the things you don’t like and focus on the things you do. Build your brand from there. What’s the next step? How is your brand evolving? I’m actively developing another aspect of myself which is my passion for food. It’s not a re-branding of myself but the development of a parallel brand if you will. To me, cooking is about designing and creating valuable food that incorporates important concepts like zero waste or slow food. There needs to be a reason behind it. That’s why I want to take JoJo in the Kitchen as far as it can go. Our relationship to food is extremely important and cooking is a part of myself that I absolutely need to share with the world. Are you prepared, in a sense, to start over again with JoJo in the Kitchen? After going through the building of my graphic design business, I feel very prepared to tackle this challenge. Having worked in various marketing and communications departments over the years, I’ve learned the things that are necessary in order to launch a brand so while the food community is still new to me, the strategies involved are similar. I don’t feel like I’m starting from scratch this time. I know what it takes, I know what I want to achieve, and I’m confident that I can make it happen. Have you planned for any potential difficulties? What challenges do you see for yourself? Time. It will take time. Building brands always takes time. I’d like it to go quicker but you can’t always control this kind of thing. There’s also always going to be setbacks but you have to keep pushing forward. One of the more interesting challenges to me is how do I present myself? Am I Jo the graphic designer or am I Jo the food entrepreneur? I’ve learned over the past few months that I need to address my audience and fulfill their expectations. I need to separate Jo the graphic designer and Jo the food entrepreneur even though they are both important parts of me. Simplicity at the end of the day is highly effective so to say I’m a graphic designer and a food entrepreneur, for some people, that’s just too dissonant. Do you think it’ll be easier this time around? I think so. I hope so! Like I said before, I’m definitely confident that I can do it. I just need to be patient and be more relaxed–to try to do the things that I can do when I can do them. I’m still a perfectionist though so it’s about being easier on myself! How can people help? If anyone wants to show their support, come to an upcoming JoJo in the Kitchen event!","September 4, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jo-Interview-Banner-photo-600x400.jpg"

Massive change is coming our way. Extreme longevity, unbridled population growth, the explosion of information flows, globally connected worlds, huge technological progress, big data, the rise of smart machines, and the advent of artificial intelligence are all quickly becoming a reality. The very nature of work might change forever. According to the World Economic Forum, in merely five years from now, over one-third of skills that are considered important in today’s workforce will have become obsolete. How are we supposed to brave these fundamental transformations? Even more so, how can we harness them to drive our business to success? 1) Embrace change The first rule of the future business world is not to resist the transformations to come. Don’t expect to grow old in one particular sector. Faced with many new challenges, we must be ready to adapt and evolve. Transitions can be very scary but they will prove necessary. Don’t be the one who drowns on the sinking ship merely because you were too afraid to jump into the cold water. In order to stay competitive, it is essential to equip yourself with a diverse skill set that is relevant as well as highly transferable to different fields. Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Be inquisitive. Be prepared to unlearn what you took for granted. Open yourself to new learning experiences. Remain on the lookout for new trends and big drivers, be it technological or socio-economic. Stay willing to continue learning far beyond the years of formal education. Evaluate which skills will push you ahead and will give you a competitive edge. Then, relentlessly pursue them. 2) Get creative All signs point to the rising importance of creative skills. A well-known IBM survey of over 1500 CEOs from across the globe actually cited creativity as the single most important characteristic of tomorrow’s leading organizations. Robots will quickly surpass our abilities to do manual labour if they have not already done so. Hence, there will be a rising demand for the kinds of skills machines are not good at. A robot might be able to produce cars much more efficiently than we do, but will it ever be able to invent an entirely unprecedented concept of mobility? Proficiency in higher-level adaptive thinking and creativity will be the foundation of success. Computers will always beat us at coming up with rules-based solutions by simply churning massive amounts of data. It is with out-of the box thinking that we can prevail. 3) Value transdisciplinarity Another way to create a competitive edge for yourself or your business is to develop a broad set of proficiencies across multiple disciplines. In the past, acquiring expertise in a specific field was a straight path to success. Alas, specialization will only get you so far in today’s world. Many of the current global problems are simply too complex to be solved by one discipline. This translates directly into the business world. The more complex the challenge ahead, the more likely you are to overcome it through unorthodox thinking. The ideal profile that will almost certainly boost your business or career is ’T-shaped’. This means that your skills cover a broad range of disciplines in which you are proficient but still offer deep specialized knowledge in one of them. Especially in a business environment where you can be certain to embark on different ventures throughout your career, the T-shaped profile of transdisciplinarity is a lifesaver. 4) Cultivate Empathy Empathy lies at the heart of 21st-century work. Why? Because empathy is the key to successful collaboration. The software company Atlassian recently sponsored a study on the future teamwork. Their results are telling. 90% of companies stated that they are working on problems so complex they simply can’t be solved by individuals. Teams are a requirement. Yet, 75% of teams report being dysfunctional. So before even worrying about AI and robots taking over, we should take a hard look at how we can solve our basic human deficiencies. So what does it take to develop an empathetic working style? According to Dr. Brene Brown, a leading researcher on vulnerability and empathy, empathy consists of four qualities: the ability to take the perspective of another person, staying away from judgment, recognizing emotion in others, and communicating that emotion. Working on those skills will go a long way. 5) Hone your cross-cultural competency Linked tightly to the last point is cross-cultural competency. This will become an important skill for us all, not just those people who have to operate in diverse geographical environments. Organizations have come to see diversity as an immense asset as it works as a driver of innovation. Research has shown that the more diverse a group, i.e. in terms of age, skills, disciplines, working and thinking styles, the more innovative they are. Scott E. Page, professor and director of the Center of the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that diverse groups outperform like-minded experts. Yet, diversity is a double-edged sword. The innovative potential of diversity can be compromised if people cannot overcome their individual differences at the work space. In order to transcend these differences and collaborate effectively, we need to learn how to navigate in culturally and socially diverse settings. We need to learn how to create cohesion between our team members by identifying and communicating points of connection, such as shared goals. In the end, our best chance to be successful in the future world of work is finding a venture that lies at the intersection of what we are deeply passionate about and where your talents lie. Combine this with the skills listed in this article and you are weathered for any storm to come. It ultimately all boils down to one question. What will you learn today that will make you more valuable tomorrow?","September 11, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/future-2372183_1280-600x400.jpg"
"154","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/13/productivity-on-the-road/","ImpactHub","Productivity on the Road","Sometimes, you cannot avoid work and it follows you on your travels, whether is at a conference or at the beach. And without a dedicated space or routine it can be difficult to get your entire to-do list accomplished. That is okay. We are here to help. We have the tools and tips to help you be productive while you are away from home – whether it is on the beach in the city or on an extended vacation. Day In Day Out The first thing you need while working away from your home, city, or favourite Impact Hub is a routine. You need to establish times that you will work. Routines can be difficult to establish when you are away from home, and we all know this to be true. One option for setting a routine is to get work tasks done before plans for the day start. It can be a relief to get work out of the way at the beginning rather than having it hang over your head for the whole day of that exciting conference you are attending. Setting up time when your work contacts can reach you is also important for establishing a routine. It will help set working times aside from vacation activities, conference dinners, or any other reason you might be travelling and have to work.This will also create a sense of accountability in your day because other people will be counting on you to answer your phone or email. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you planned. You can’t work in the hotel room because your early morning will cause your partner to wake up too early (they might actually be on vacation). Or you walked twenty kilometres the day before and have no desire to get up early. Or the plans for the day start at the time that you would normally have set aside to work. Which means you need to be flexible and realistic with your work expectations. Or you just need to go somewhere else and get everything on your list accomplished for the day. There is no place like home – or is there? We all have limited options when staying in someone else’s house or in a hotel. The desk and the uncomfortable chair that is supposed to be your office while away is rarely appealing. Coffee shops while comfortable, and have a ready supply of caffeine, often have unreliable internet connections. So where can you go? It has to be somewhere that you know you can work well in. Somewhere that has a ready supply of caffeinated beverages. Somewhere comfortable with a reliable internet connection. And somewhere that isn’t isolated from other people. Fortunately, Impact Hub has you covered! You are already an Impact Hub Member. Just go to the local Impact Hub. Which is slightly more difficult in Canada as Ottawa is currently the only one in that vast landmass. Impact Hub Ottawa As an Impact Hub Vienna member, you get 3 days a year for free at any Impact Hub in the world. Regardless of whether you are off to Amsterdam or Zagreb there is always a place to work. And trust us, it is a home away from home. Recently while away, I spent a day at Impact Hub Ottawa. I met James Chan, the Programming Lead, who graciously showed me where they kept the tea and coffee, introduced me to members in Ottawa, and gave me the internet password. I also met Vita Sgardello, the Community Lead, who told me about their tradition of “brown bag lunches”. This is where people bring their own lunch to a short lecture given by one of the community members. On that day, it was how to camp for free in Ontario. The Impact Hub in Ottawa is fantastic. Everyone is super welcoming and It was a relaxing space in which to work. Just like Vienna. Portable Projects Sometimes, entrepreneurs and freelancers of all types can feel a bit like being an office hobo. You pack up a few things in your bindle for the day and off you go. Being close to your home means your resources are always within reach. However, when you are on the road this is another issue entirely. While the majority of your work is probably stored on a laptop or tablet you still access books, people, and other physical resources on an almost daily basis. This means finding ways to make it electronic or to condense it realistically. This might mean downloading books that you need for a project on your tablet – either from the library, on-line booksellers or through accessing materials that are no longer under copyright with Google Books. This also might mean that if you need a drafting table to design your next bag or product it might be better left for your return. Portability also means choosing projects that can be realistically completed while you are travelling. Final thoughts You are travelling and away. Which means that you should also enjoy the reason that you find yourself in another city (or on the beach in Vienna). Don’t despair that you aren’t getting all your work done.Pack up all your portable work and head out to the nearest Impact Hub.Relax, you will definitely be productive on your travels.

"155","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/18/spotlight-conversation-sabine-kampmuller-afya/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Sabine Kampmüller of AFYA"," Sabine Kampmüller is the founder of AFYA, an organization that works on intercultural health promotion. Their current mission is to support children and adolescents who suffer from post-traumatic stress. Prior to founding AFYA, Sabine worked for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for 20 years. After several years abroad doing field work in Africa and other parts of the world, she settled in the MSF offices in Vienna to tackle global health issues and work on organisational learning. Currently in the midst of setting up AFYA, Sabine took some time to sit down and talk about her organization, what motivates her, and the future she wants to see. What made you start AFYA? AFYA is directly linked to where I come from professionally. It was a privilege to work for MSF, but it was time to do something new. The last few years, with all the migrants and refugees arriving in Austria, I see new and different health needs and these needs are not being covered by the existing health system. Given our extensive first-hand experience of working in health and intercultural settings, my colleagues at AFYA and I feel that we have something to contribute. We want to offer our expertise and do something to address the current problems that we see. What does AFYA stand for? AFYA is not an acronym. The word means health and well-being in Arabic and Kiswahili. Kiswahili was my first working language in Kenya so that’s why I chose AFYA as the name for the organization. I feel that mental health is an important issue in the refugee population. A big proportion of people have experienced trauma either from the conflict in their home country or during their journey here. There aren’t any hard numbers because nobody has studied this but from experience, and from working with different groups, the estimate is that at least half of refugees and migrants have significant post-traumatic stress reactions. This issue is an important link to Austrian expectations on integration because this is such a large obstacle to integration. A young Afghan I met recently summed up his experience: “In order to learn, I need peace in my mind.” He stopped school because his head wasn’t calm enough. We need to do something about this as a society. What is intercultural health? How would you define it? Intercultural health ensures that the different backgrounds of people are taken into consideration in the provision of health care. It tries to bridge the gap between people’s needs, concepts, and perceptions, and the existing health service. Concerning mental health, this means that we allow different cultural explanations of what is wrong without judging these ways of dealing with psychological issues as long as they are not harmful. We build on the respective understanding and we offer information and solutions based on medical evidence. It’s about mobilizing people’s own resources and capacities to deal with trauma first. What’s wrong with the current health system with regards to mental health? Let’s be clear, the Austrian health system is very good, but it’s a specialized health system; it’s very focused on curative and hospitalized care. Right now, there is psychotherapy and psychiatric care, but the entry level to access these services is very high. You have to have very serious problems before you get support. Organisations such as Hemayat do excellent work offering psychotherapy with cultural mediators, but their waiting lists are long and many people don’t get there in the first place. Our approach is to complement this with primary support and ensuring that the entry level is low. Our work is not therapeutic but aims at strengthening coping mechanisms. We go to the homes where unaccompanied minors live and teach them “recovery techniques”. We try to make their difficulties easy to understand. We want to prevent very serious problems before they happen. How has your work with MSF and the work you do now affected you? The work I did with MSF has definitely made me very humble. There are many things in life that we often take for granted such as security and the freedom to move and speak that I have learned to appreciate. It was such an exciting experience to see so many different ways of livings and so many different dreams and experiences. It’s only fed into my curiosity to find out more about other people’s history and stories. I have also learned that a culture of reflection is important. Humanitarian work is becoming more complex and with the increase in complexity, we need to be more agile, make use of what we’ve learned, and think of how can we improve going forward. What are some of the difficulties you’re facing? The biggest challenge is funding, of course, especially as a new organization. It’s very difficult to get into the appropriate channels, but we’re working on it. Have you encountered any resistance to the work that you do? This is a new field and it could be seen as competition to traditional psychotherapy even if what we do is not therapy. Even though we clearly make that distinction, I’m anticipating a level of questioning concerning whether we are all qualified to do the work that we do. The program is designed to largely run with trained native speakers under good supervision. Our aim is to enable kids and adolescents to use the tools that we teach them to take control of their stress reactions. We don’t delve into trauma or what happened. It’s about teaching and practicing techniques to take charge of your own emotions. Why do you do this kind of work? I was always curious about other countries and cultures. As a child, I was inspired by an uncle of mine who was a development worker. My most exciting childhood memories were him coming back and talking about the work he did in Papua New Guinea and Africa. I simply like to work on improving things and making things better. I think mental health is one of the big challenges in our society today. I find it exciting that we have a much more diverse people here today in Austria, and it’s full of opportunities. I don’t want to interpret this diversity as a problem–it’s an opportunity. And if we want to utilize this opportunity, we need to overcome obstacles. What would you like to see AFYA become? I want AFYA to be the leading organization when it comes to intercultural health issues. I want us to develop lots of new programs and be a very agile organization that really contributes to the health and well-being of refugees and migrants in Austria. What impact would you like to see AFYA have? I really want to see that we’ve enabled a few hundred kids, adolescents and adults to gain control over their post-traumatic stress in the next few years. I believe that’s doable. On a more political level, I would like to see the issue of mental health higher on the agenda so we can mobilize additional attention and resources towards it. How can members of Impact Hub help? Contribute ideas! What we need now are connections to groups and communities who are in need of our services. This is already happening but we welcome more connections. There are some practical things as well: setting up the organization and translation among other things. I’ll be asking for help!","September 18, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sabine-Kampmüller-600x400.jpg"
"156","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/09/20/resources-for-women-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Resources for Women Entrepreneurs","Over the last decade, women have made significant headway in the field of entrepreneurship. Studies show that 49% of all 6900 new one-person businesses in Vienna in 2017 were started by women and around 33% of Austrian companies are led by women. While we’re leaps and bounds ahead of where we were only ten years ago, we still have a long way to go. Women still receive significantly less investment capital to fund their enterprises and must continue to battle stereotypes as they launch and grow their startup. Thankfully, we’ve begun to see targeted, well-structured support programs for female entrepreneurs popping up in Austria and internationally that help to provide women with the training, support, and network they need to be successful. We put together this list of some of the most relevant resources for women who want to start or grow their businesses: Women in Business Women in Business is a contact partner within the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber for female entrepreneurs. They foster networking among female entrepreneurs by arranging lectures and seminars, providing information on current topics and practical advice—for example on how to improve negotiation skills and leadership. They also give support by temporarily offering replacement of the female entrepreneur in case she unable to work in the event of an accident or during maternity leave. You can check their website here. Female Founders Female Founders is a platform created and directed by three women with experience in the Austrian startup scene. The organization is dedicated to helping female entrepreneurs connect with their peers while providing mentorship opportunities. They also offer seminars and a “Bootcamp” which is a 10-week program where you will learn how to start or to continue your business with support and lectures from entrepreneurs and highly-motivated business founders. You can check this website here. Business Professional Women This is one of the most influential international networks of business and professional women with affiliates in 95 countries across five continents. The aim of BPW is to enable women to sustain themselves economically. In addition, BPW offers personal development programs for members such as mentoring, leadership training and e-Business training. Their projects aim to protect female rights, help them to overcome their limitations, and create a nurturing environment for development. You can check their website here. Female Leader Initiative (FELIN) FELIN is an independent network of women created by female leaders. Their aim is to help highly qualified women in Styria get into leadership positions. FELIN offers targeted activities for companies and organizations. It also features a network that allows women to get in touch with each other. Although only available in German, since they target specifically female entrepreneurs in Styria, it is worth checking out if you’re starting up in the area. Visit their site here. WINGS WINGS is an international project founded in 2014 and co-financed by the European Commission. Their main goal is to unite initiatives undertaken by female entrepreneurs and provide them with a European network for those who want to support or be engaged in female entrepreneurial activities. WINGS builds effective and efficient female entrepreneurship ecosystems, as well as supporting and integrating sustainable entrepreneurship programs. It is an excellent tool for women who are planning to start a business and for those who already have one and want to network and meet more people or mentors who can help them develop and grow their venture through events, online courses and more. Their online platform is very user-friendly and even allows you to create your own personal online shop in easy-to-follow steps. It also contains a vast quantity of mentors around Europe that you can contact for free. We recommend trying their website. Honorable mentions These two websites also provide interesting content and articles that address a lot of topics that are interesting for female entrepreneurs: Ladies Who Launch and Women 2.0. It’s exciting to see the opportunities and success stories of women founders who are being supported through platforms and associations like these. While there is still far to go in terms of how we support and encourage female entrepreneurship, these resources certainly help provide women with key tools they need to help them build a network of support, tap into personal motivation, learn business competencies, and grow their businesses.

"157","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/10/02/interview-questions-for-your-first-hire/","ImpactHub","Interviewing for your First Employee: A Guide","—You have worked hard. You had a brilliant idea, wrote a proposal, networked with investors, secured funding, promoted your business, and now your start-up needs to grow. You need to hire someone to handle your more complex finances, someone to manage your supply chain, or someone to handle your back-office work. Whatever your need there is someone out there. However, you want to make sure you get the right fit. The right person, who shares your values and the understands the mission you are on. Someone committed to your success. That is where interviewing comes into play. We know that this is a daunting task, so, we thought we would help you out with a guide to interviewing your first employee. I used to work in Human Resources in a large organization. We recruited thousands of people a year. Everything from PhD research physicists and physicians to clerical and cleaning staff. We had to assure the fit for the organization and the individual team. This is difficult to do without properly performing an interview process. Step 1: The Posting The interview process starts with the posting. This is where you your ideal candidate’s profile. This covers everything from education and experience to individual attributes. Postings are also a way to attract the ideal candidate to you. A well-crafted posting will have the right individuals select themselves into your recruitment process. For candidates wanting to work with you this is the first step in them interviewing you. Yes, this process works both ways. This is your first opportunity to sell yourself and your business to the right candidates. Postings should include your expectations for education and experience, e.g. do you require someone a university degree in finance? Do they need experience working in the financial sector? How much? What type of finance – corporate, banking, NGO, charitable? They should also include the skills and abilities you need. Deciding this is not as easy as the more objective education and experience. Will your new employee be supervised directly? If you answered no then you need someone who can work well on their own. A motivated self-starter. Do you need someone to sell your product? Then you need someone who can manage customers and has good communication skills. Step 2: Crafting your Interview Questions This is not as difficult as it sounds. I promise. You need to achieve balance between a technical skills test and fit. Some questions will have to be about their technical competence. These are questions like: “How would you create a taxonomy to identify key customer trends in unstructured data?” You are the best person to determine these questions as this is your area of expertise. And you also know the answers. The questions concerning fit are another issue entirely. Gone are the days of “if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?” Besides the ridiculous answers that you get about being an oak with strong roots and branches to shelter everything from passing storms it tells you nothing about the candidate sitting in front of you. A former director of mine once said “the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour”. This means that you need to ask behavioural questions about what they have done as opposed to hypothetical questions. Hypothetical behavioural questions can be turned easily into ideal questions: Example: Current Question: What would you do if you had a conflict with a customer? Better Question: Tell me about a time that you were in a conflict situation with a customer. What did you do? What would you do differently? What did you learn from the experience? The “better question” is much more elucidating. This gives you greater insight into the candidate’s behaviours and thought processes. Always remember to write your ideal answers down. You will need them to make a grading rubric so that you can compare the answers that candidates give you to the ideal and score their responses. Step 3: The Interview Today is the day. You have looked through hundreds of applications. You selected the best five and they are all coming in today. You made your interview question sheets with your answer rubric so that you can record everything as the interview progresses. All you need to do is start the interview. The first step in this case is to put the candidate at ease. They are nervous. You are going to throw a lot of questions at them about their technical expertise and their personality. They have been practicing and they want to get it right. You just need to start with “hello, and how are you?” or give them a few minutes to centre themselves in their physical and headspace by describing a bit about yourself, your company, and your vision for the future. Then dive into the questions. While the candidate is answering, take notes. Lots of notes. Ask questions to clarify anything you do not understand. This is important as it shows the candidate that you value them and are listening. When you are finished with your questions it is always a good idea to ask if they have any questions. They are interviewing you too. This gives the candidate an opportunity to find out a little more about who you are and what you are offering. This is also a great opportunity to assess them. The questions asked also give insight into character. If one asks about dress code that could be someone who wants to comply with rules. If one asks about what type of manager you are the information being sought is your management and delegation style. Final Thoughts Just follow this simple process and you will soon be looking at how to on-board your first employee.

Florian Übelacker, Chief Commercial Officer of primeCROWD and Lena Gansterer, Co-Founder of IRP, sat down to talk about what’s special about the new partnership, working together, and the benefits for entrepreneurs. Could you tell us a little bit more about primeCROWD? Florian: We are an Angel-crowd investing platform and help selected startups to get funding–we vet them, we present them to our investors, and ultimately our mission is to enable startups to pursue their dreams. That’s what we stand for. What will this new partnership look like? Florian: Good ideas arise in liquid networks where cooperation and openness is valued more than protection. Our partnership will focus on this ethos through co-hosting events, raising awareness, and coaching and mentoring startups by helping them overcome hurdles, spark new ideas, have fun, and ideally also get funding. Lena: Our ambitions and vision for this partnership are the same. Right now, the focus of the partnership is the Investment Ready Program and getting entrepreneurs access to the right investors. Many of the entrepreneurs we work with are social entrepreneurs who are looking for investors interested in impact investing. Partnering with networks such as primeCROWD helps us to have access to investors that our startups might not otherwise meet. Why is this an exciting opportunity for entrepreneurs who take part in IRP? Lena: Throughout the program, entrepreneurs receive a great deal of expertise, support, and guidance from mentors affiliated with Impact Hub Vienna. primeCROWD is now joining our expert pool and will support entrepreneurs from day one in the program. It’s really the best of both worlds. Florian: Exactly but not only that, our network of investors is a very inclusive network. Since the return on social impact investments can be considered equal to standard investments, these kinds of investments are not just for impact investors–it makes sense for traditional investors to look at these opportunities too so we facilitate these relationships. Social ventures can offer attractive returns. It’s not just about the cause. What kind of guidance and support can IRP participants expect from this partnership? Florian: We are here to help entrepreneurs, who have traded financial security and stability for uncertainty, to navigate successfully through this very period of uncertainty. We work a lot with investors so we have a very clear understanding of what they value and know more often than not down to the individual level what an investor likes. We can help entrepreneurs by showing them what kind of questions they can expect from specific investors and thus what pitches they should use. Lena: We partner with several investor networks and primeCROWD really has a special network in Austria and the know-how about how to structure a co-investment deal. Co-investment deals lower the risk of early-stage investments for the first investors and therefore are an important tool for the entrepreneurs we work with in the Investment Ready Program. How can people learn more about this opportunity? Lena: Join the Impact Hub network! Sign up for the next Investment Ready Program! Florian: Pick up the phone! Give us a call, tell us your story, and why we should care. We will listen.","October 9, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Working-Together-Impact-Hub-Vienna-and-primeCrowd-Banner-600x400.jpg"

She is driven by her conviction that European integration is too good to fail – internally as well as globally. She is trained and experienced in diplomacy, multi-stakeholder EU processes, and international quality journalism.Read this interview in German ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Verena Ringler can be called an activist of the “Erasmus generation”. She firmly believes in the underlying potential, necessity, and resilience of transnational cooperation in Europe. Across the continent, she scouts for individuals, identifies groups, and spots trends concerning Europe’s societal and political developments. The Impact Hub has since its inception been one of her pools of potential stakeholders and interlocutors. This is why Verena Ringler supports the hub as a Crowd Investor. According to her, “there is a Viennese public life before the Impact Hub– and a Vienna with the Impact Hub.” “Doing things differently in order to do different things” is what informs Verena Ringler’s approach to hands-on work on European integration. She suspects that this is also part of the response to the challenges of our time, such as youth unemployment in southern Europe, the immense loss of trust due to the Eurozone crisis, migration policy, climate policies, or participation in democracy. For Verena, these challenges are here not to be circumvented, ignored, or belittled—they are here to be tackled. Since 2013, she has been devising and realizing a large number of projects in the Europe Cluster of Stiftung Mercator, a private foundation. In her projects, she identifies practical interventions at the politics-society interface. They range from the “Mercator European Dialogue” – a backchannel platform for national members of parliaments across borders—all the way to “Rethink Europe” at the European Council on Foreign Relations. As a Crowd Investor of the Impact Hub Vienna, Verena not only supports the hub but also shares her thoughts on its long-term role. Why do you support the Impact Hub? I am happy to support the Impact Hub, which serves as both a space and a place here in Vienna, Austria. People with different backgrounds and from different fields work together towards the future. To me, what’s enticing about the Impact Hub is that all its members – while working on different things, in different branches – seem to be great friends of the future, no matter how uncertain that might be. How would you describe the Impact Hub? The Impact Hub resembles an ecosystem. Someone has planted seeds, and tending these ideas leads to a variety of different outcomes. What are your hopes and expectations for the Impact Hub? One man’s antagonist is another man’s policy advisor. In this respect, the Impact Hub, based on the experience it has gained in its first few years, could turn from a taker of the policy agenda to a co-shaper of Austria’s policy agenda. It’s quite fascinating to see the Impact Hub turn, step by step, into an Impact Advocate; members of the Impact Hub would thus become experts on social impact. Slowly and surely then, they would inject themselves into Austria’s political life. They would understand, prepare, represent and advance the interests and themes of contemporary initiatives in Austria, who are often non-governmental, non-profit, one-person in their set-up. What does impact mean to you? For me, impact is when, after an activity or a project, people emerge differently than how they were when they started. When an activity or project creates an internal or external transformation. In your opinion, what is the contribution of institutions such as the Impact Hub to social development? I suspect that the potential reach of the Impact Hub is huge because the Impact Hub sits like a cluster of future-minded individuals and initiatives in the center of Vienna’s public life. There are certainly match-making or synergy effects that Impact Hub can trace from the beginning to their end, but there are many more such contributions that are not yet even documented, or traced. Just visit the Impact Hub for one day and document how many guests, partners, and newcomers walk in an out—they walk out with more access to information, players, and markets. They profit from efficiency and spillover gains, from knowledge transfer and indirect contacts. In your recent lecture “Reaching for the Stars” at the Vorarlberg “Days of Utopia” festival you spoke about the “non-profit single European market”. What is that, what should happen? Today the EU developed a single market for capital, goods and services, employers and employees. But there is no single market for the non-profit sector. An NGO still needs to register in all EU Member States if it wants to operate all over. The same applies to donors and foundations. And yet: If we all think we do need a non-profit single market in order to lift our impact, we need to realize that it’s us we have been waiting for. We must learn to fight politically for our own playing field – to research ourselves and build expertise, to contact MPs, to convince them to forge alliances, and to advocate relentlessly for a European association statute that works for all, from Finland to Portugal. Or, consider a whole other field, the field of the EU budget. Why not pilot with participative budgeting e.g. in some regional and youth funding lines, and thus bring citizens to the table from the beginning of a budgeting process? Why not use EU taxpayers’ money efficiently and effectively? Why not dream of a group, say, the Impact Hub and its friends, to inject themselves into the negotiations for the next EU’s multiannual financial framework? Why not advocate for a first “Citizens Million,” i.e. one million euros of EU money that citizens could program themselves in a joint, participatory process? Where do you see Impact Hub Vienna in 10 years? I guess once the Impact Hub has also become an Impact Advocate, the next step would be embarking on “Impact Research.” So, the Impact Hub could undertake empirical research on society and economics in Austria. It would work together with international research groups. It could address overarching or cross-cutting questions of social impact and thus of values, the economy, and society.

"160","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/10/30/validate-business-idea/","ImpactHub","How to validate a business idea","You’ve got a new business idea, and you think it’s got great potential. Awesome! But how do you know anyone will spend their hard-earned cash on your product? Validating your business idea early and often is key to launching a successful product or service. Here are a few ideas on how to get started. Clearly define the problem you’re solving and for whom First things first. You may love your idea, but if it’s not solving a problem or need for your prospective customer, you’re going to have a hard time convincing anybody to purchase it. Start by talking to as many people as you can in your target audience and listen carefully to their answers. Why do they need this product? How will it make their lives easier? The key to this phase is to remove your ego and assumptions from the process so you can be as receptive as possible to their input. Need help to determine if you’re solving for the right problem? Check out this article from Harvard Business Review. Analyze the competition While you may ultimately choose to ignore what the competition is doing and go your own route as so many startups in Silicon Valley suggest, it would be foolish not to at least inform yourself of what is happening in your industry and niche. Not only will investors want to know that you’re up to speed on the competition, but you need to be firmly convinced that the value you’re creating isn’t being solved for elsewhere. That’s not to say that you can’t enter a market that already has established players—but if you plan to do so, you need to understand what your unique selling proposition is that goes above and beyond what’s already on the market (or segments it in a targeted way). Build a prototype Start with a small budget and put together something concrete that you can begin to adapt. It’s very rare that your product or service will be perfect in its first form. You’ll likely need to go through several iterations before you find a solution that satisfies your ideal consumer, so consider validation just part of the development process. Set aside some capital so you can invest in responding to the validation work you’re about to embark on. Find beta testers It might be tough to expose your idea at first, but if you want it to become a reality, you need to engage some beta testers. Seek out a few of those folks you engaged in the first stage of this process and let them give you feedback on your first attempt. One word of advice here, if you’re going to share your product or service with friends or family, take their feedback with a grain of salt. Ultimately, they may not be your ideal customer. If that’s the case, then be careful about incorporating their ideas into the next iteration of your product. In this phase, your customer is the only one that truly matters. Take advantage of an online community If your idea fits into a niche interest where others are also very passionate, or if you’re looking for some support from fellow people looking to launch an idea, look on Facebook, Reddit, or other online communities for appropriate groups where you can openly discuss your idea and get some feedback. Check out this list of product testing sites where you can get users to review and respond to your product or idea. Again, same rules apply. Responses from your ideal customer should take priority over all others. Launch a mini-campaign Test interest in your product by launching a mini-campaign to your targeted user-group before you actually release the product. You can do this by creating a landing page that describes your product and asking people to sign up and stay informed on when the launch happens. The thought leaders at Moz put together this whiteboard Friday video to provide you with some guidelines on how to best execute this strategy. We hope you found these strategies on how to validate your business idea helpful! Best of luck as you take your first step into entrepreneurship.","October 30, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Validate-your-business-idea-care-banner-600x400.jpg"
"161","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/06/spotlight-conversation-dimitrios-prodromou-humanizing-technologies/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: A conversation with Dimitrios Prodromou of Humanizing Technologies"," Dimitrios Prodromou is the Co-Founder and Chief Technical Officer of Humanizing Technologies, a company that advises, sells, and develops applications for social robots. Their current focus is Pepper, the most advanced humanoid robot available on the market today. The company is growing rapidly and every day is a jam-packed work day but Dimitrios was able to step away for a few minutes to talk to us about his company, Pepper, and the ambition he has for his company’s future. What made you start Humanizing Technologies? I’ve worked in robotics now for over 13 years. Last year I met Tim Schuster (Co-Founder and CEO of Humanizing Technologies) and we decided to combine forces: his business know-how with my skills in robotics. We’re a perfect match! And we chose to pursue this idea of humanizing robots starting with Pepper. What is the goal of your company? The goal is to not just have more human-like robots but to have robots that benefit and complement humanity. This is what’s called social robotics and service robotics. What we ultimately want is for the robot to be a valued assistant or a companion that frees up time for the user to do things that people are more capable of doing—creativity for example. Why now? What makes what you offer important for today? In the last couple of years, there’s been a lot of robots—an automatic vacuum cleaner for example—which were handy but not necessarily socially accepted. But now there’s Pepper, who is socially accepted and most importantly, affordable. Now’s the time because it wasn’t feasible or affordable before. And instead of creating robots that are seen as a threat to people’s livelihoods, we’d like to do the opposite. Can you describe Pepper? Pepper is a humanoid robot or half humanoid because she has wheels instead of legs. She is 120 cm tall and we refer to her as a female because her name is Pepper after Pepper Potts. She’s friendly, petite, cute, has big eyes, and approachable. Right now, I think it’s the most advanced humanoid robot that’s commercially available based on her looks and how advanced the software already is. What are the values that you associate with your company? We are focused on building a good relationship with our customers. We’re not interested in just taking the projects, doing them, and moving on. We build connections to our projects and to our clients. We listen to them and give them what they really need. Empathy is extremely important to us. Have you encountered any difficulties to get to where you are now? Some of the issues we’ve had have been to re-calibrate expectations of what Pepper can and cannot do. Pepper is so advanced that people think that she can do anything and everything. Can she bring me a beer? Can she vacuum? Can she do the dishes? A lot of this current misperception is based on marketing videos which are great to watch but don’t represent reality. It makes the expectations really high. Normally it’s about raising the expectations of the product that you’re offering and we’re having to do the opposite! A good difficulty is that we’re growing really fast. We’re already up to 13 people in two locations: Germany and here in Austria. Managing that growth is a challenge. Given that we’re a really young company, it’s a lot of people very quickly but everyone is incredibly motivated because they found us and believe in what we’re trying to do. What’s next for Humanizing Technologies? We have an upcoming project that’s really exciting. We’re going to use Pepper to help in caregiving for people suffering from dementia. We want to research what the possibilities are. While stopping dementia is out of our hands, we want to see whether we can help slow down the effects of dementia with games or animations being some of the ideas we’re throwing around right now. It’s a long-term project that’s not money-driven but knowledge-driven. We want to use the robot for a good cause. This is what the word humanizing stands for. Doing something with your heart and your mind. What would you like to see your company become? We’re definitely moving down the path we want to be on. It would be good if we can shape the perception that people have towards robots and move further into developing new robots, new hardware and seeing what we can do and how we should use it. We definitely have the right people so it’s all just a matter of time until we get there. What impact would you like to see Humanizing Technologies achieve in the next few years? There’s a lot of different things! With regards to Pepper, we’d like to make her more alive, more intuitive, more functional. Concerning our upcoming project with the elderly, it would be amazing to be able to have a measurable and lasting impact. Right now, given that we haven’t started, we don’t have any concrete ideas about how Pepper is going to communicate with the elderly—we have theories and we’re going to test and we’re going to iterate until we get it right but as of this moment it’s unexplored territory which is exciting! The idea is that Pepper becomes a companion who can recognize and remember and interact with an elderly person in a fluid way. It might sound like a dream but the technology is there. Sometimes you need to push your dreams to get where you need to go. How can members of Impact Hub help? Ideas! We always need ideas. We can always use ideas, input, knowledge, or mentoring. This will never stop! As technicians, we have specific ideas and we go down specific roads and are more often than not preoccupied with the path we have chosen. We don’t think about other possibilities. But from personal experience, someone comes along who has nothing to do with this industry and they have a suggestion for an idea that we never even thought about and it’s great! You might not have the technical skills but you do have the ideas so come talk to us!","November 6, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-08-at-11.27.17-600x400.png"
"162","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/09/six-essential-tools-for-startup-founders/","ImpactHub","Six Essential Tools for Startup Founders","If you’re about to launch your own startup or you’re already a startup founder, more than likely you’ve seen a lot of rhetoric and received many a sales email about productivity tools for entrepreneurs. It’s true that juggling the many roles of being an entrepreneur is made significantly easier with the help of great technology, but it’s extremely time-consuming and disruptive to constantly transition from one app to another in search of the best solution for your team. When it comes to equipping yourself and your startup with time-saving tech, the best rule to follow is to just keep it simple. Choose options with a low barrier to entry so your team doesn’t have to spend a ton of time training on all the bells and whistles and only implement the ones that will really help your team move the needle, now. You can adopt more sophisticated tech when you really need it. Here is a list of six free or low-cost apps that have been tried and tested by numerous startups and are sure to ease the burden of operating a growing team. Slack When it comes to the successful team management, quick and organized communication is the key. With Slack, you can forget about exhausting email ping-pong and losing your valuable business time. This app allows you to freely organize all team discussions and has all conversations located in the same place. Slack is available in mobile app version allowing you to stay in touch with your team as you’re out on the fundraising trail. Slack offers many additional features for paid users, but free tool version will meet most of the early-stage entrepreneur necessities. Expensify True to their mantra, Expensify make expense reports that don’t suck! Because let’s be honest—organizing and categorizing a stack of business receipts is one of those least-favorite tasks of any founder. Expensify makes the reporting process much easier by allowing you to capture expenses and add them to your report the moment the transaction occurs, so you don’t have to hang onto anything for later. Simple snap a pic of your receipt from your smartphone and add it to your app, and you’ll be saved that dreaded end-of-week task of pulling crumpled receipts from your wallet. Calendly When it comes to scheduling meetings, conferences or business calls, Calendly is a big time-saver. Instead of going through the endless process of picking through your calendar and suggesting times for your appointment, you can simply share a calendar link to others and let them choose a free time slot. After the meeting is booked, the app sends out an automatic invitation to both user calendars. Easy. The basic features of the Calendly app are also free. Upwork When you’re launching a business, you need a wide variety of support. From design work to copy editing to admin work, it’s hard to find a jack-of-all-trades employee who can provide assistance in so many different fields. Instead of hiring employees and taking on the payroll risk, founders might consider hiring freelancers to take on tasks one project at a time. The UpWork app gives you an access to a platform full of professionals in such areas as web and mobile development, writing, design, virtual assistance, customer service reps and more. It makes the hiring process extremely simple and allows you to view ratings and reviews of any hire, so you know the quality of work you can expect. Asana Asana is an easy-to-use and cost-friendly project management tool, that allows the different size of working teams to communicate on projects in one central location and manage all the assets and assignments in one place. The app is straightforward task management and will help you to collaborate on your projects with your team members from any location. They have an assortment of training videos to help get you up to speed quickly, and best of all, it integrates with Slack so you can create tasks from your team conversations. Hellosign As the term sheets start rolling in, Hellosign is a great tool to help you manage signing and scanning documents. It allows you to sign contracts and other legal documents with a legally binding electronic signature. The app is free for up to three documents a month. Your printer ink costs and the environment will thank you. All these apps will allow you to cut the admin work, streamline your communication and project management, and spend more time focusing on what you do best—growing your business.

"163","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/11/21/entrepreneurship-vs-innovation-evening-steve-blank/","ImpactHub","Entrepreneurship and Innovation: An evening with Steve Blank","Photo Credit: Pioneers Steve Blank is one of the key figures behind the Lean Startup movement. He is an icon and pioneer of Silicon Valley, a serial entrepreneur, a bestselling author, a professor, and a prolific thought leader with a wide reach. He has a marked global influence on all things startup, that spans continents, and was recently received to share his thoughts on the startup scene in Vienna. Affable, friendly, and excited to regale the receptive audience at Impact Hub Vienna with his Silicon Valley experiences, Steve Blank explained the mindset and tools needed in order to become a successful entrepreneur. He shared the hard-learned lessons he took to heart during his entrepreneurial days and provided key insights for founders. Here, we’ve put together a list of some of our takeaways from an evening with Steve Blank: 1. Your hypothesis of your customers’ wants on day one is only a guess. Whether it’s your product, customers, pricing, or channels, there are no facts inside your building. You can only learn by leaving the office and talking to your customers. 2. You must build and test a minimum viable product A minimum viable product is not a prototype, but it can lead you to one. It’s whatever you build and gets you the most amount of learning at a point in time. It could be a wireframe or a powerpoint presentation or a spreadsheet. Use it to build layer after layer as you get feedback from customers. 3. The Lean Startup method is not THE method but A method The Lean Startup method grew out of a reaction to everything before it and the belief that startups are just smaller versions of large companies. It is up to us to use it, modify it, and build on it. It’s not supposed to be the endpoint. It’s a springboard to what we’ll learn in the coming years. 4. Just because you have the information, it doesn’t mean you have the wisdom It’s not about smarts. There are some things you just won’t know until you try it and fail. Reading about something isn’t the same as going out there, putting it all on the line, and doing it. 5. Improve your entrepreneurial ecosystem by learning from each other Pay it forward. Share with each other. Ask someone how they screwed up? What would they’ve done differently? Who’s the best VC? Give back to the entrepreneurial ecosystem because creating successful startups and a thriving community requires everyone to participate. Find mentors and when you’re ready, become one yourself. 6. Ask your mentor valuable questions Don’t ask your mentor for answers you could’ve found on Google. Show you did the work and you still need their unique perspective to help with a few things. These conversations are fun and valuable for both parties. 7. Any successful entrepreneur has likely failed at some point Failure is a part of the process. The culture of failure is the nature of startups, and people need to be open and understand that it is key to entrepreneurship. Most startups fail, and you’ll likely feel pretty miserable. But out of the ashes can rise even greater successes. 8. Don’t believe your own bullshit Also known as hubris, Steve Blank was hit by this and it resulted in his greatest disaster. He shared his biggest failure by explaining how he raised 35 million dollars for a video game company, marketed the hell out of it, and lost it all. There were warning signs along the way, but he ignored them. It took him a while to accept what had happened but when he finally did, when he finally reflected on his failure and chose to learn from all the ways it went wrong, that’s when the first seeds of the Lean Startup method came to be which is arguably his greatest success. 9. Show up 80% of entrepreneurship is showing up more than everybody else. Show up for your customers, show up for your investors, and show up for talks and conferences because showing up creates opportunities that you would’ve never found otherwise.

"165","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2017/12/04/spotlight-goood-conversation-georg-woschnagg-claudia-winkler/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: How to be goood! A conversation with Georg Woschnagg and Claudia Winkler"," Georg Woschnagg and Claudia Winkler are Co-Founders of goood, a mobile phone service provider where 10% of your monthly fees are donated to a social cause or charity of your choice. They are off and running in Germany and in Austria and have partnerships with organizations such as Caritas, World Wildlife Fund, and the German Red Cross. Proud, homegrown, and longtime members of Impact Hub Vienna as well as graduates of the Investment Ready Program, goood is all about combining social impact and profit. Georg and Claudia sat down to talk about how it all started, the resistance they faced along the way, and how we can and should shape our future. What made you start goood? Claudia: Around two years ago, I was in a successful career as a telecommunications executive but started to think to myself what’s the purpose of it all? There has to be more to life than making shareholders rich and earning a lot of money. So I took a break from my career, started studying social innovation, helped set up a NGO focused on integration called Fremde werden Freunde, and then six months later I got a call from our Co-Founder Matthias Frenzl about helping to set up goood. It was such a perfect alignment of my skillset and my passion for social causes that I immediately said yes. Georg: It’s funny, I’ve known Claudia for 12 years because we worked for the same company but only briefly did we actually work together. And around the same time as she decided to take a break from her career, I also did the same to stay at home and take care of my kids. I was thinking about them and how one day they would ask me what I did and why which drove me to work in the non-profit sector. And then one day we met up for coffee just as old colleagues and the rest is history. Neither of us had a clue about each other’s interest in social issues. It’s almost cosmic how it all worked out. goood is a transparent social business. What is that and why is that important to you? Georg: We made it our mission from the beginning that from the very first moment a customer engages with goood, we want them to know exactly what’s happening with their hard-earned money. Therefore, there’s no hidden activation fees or gotcha fees to maximize our revenue. We know how to do these things given our experience in the industry but that’s not what we’re about. We wanted first and foremost to create a clean and transparent product and we’ve done that. Second, we want customers to be able to see that 100% of their monthly donation is going to the social cause of their choice. We have nothing to hide so why hide anything? Claudia: We want people to know how our business model works. We want everyone to see where the money comes from and where it’s going. It’s not our intention to get rich with this and we want people to see that. What we want is to create social impact. That’s why we’re here. That’s what’s motivating us. That’s what’s driving us. We’re transparent because that’s how things should be and it shows everyone that what we’re doing works and not just to other startups but to the big corporations as well. What is it about social entrepreneurship that motivates you? Claudia: Purpose. We are motivated by the idea that you can shape your future. We might just be making a small step in the right direction but with enough small steps, the sky’s the limit as they say. Georg: It’s such a worthy challenge to try and combine the profit world and the non-profit world. In our experience, it’s easier to be one or the other. To combine the two is very difficult so we took the hard road. But, we’re extremely proud about what we’ve built because it is truly a marriage of both worlds and it’s socially and economically sustainable. Companies are more often than not faceless legal entities. We want to create a company with a face that contributes to society. How are you able to give 10% of a customer’s monthly fee to a social cause? Georg: We run a very lean operation and are extremely diligent about managing our margins. In order to make our business model work, we have to sacrifice some marketing spend and we have to sacrifice some profit. But like we said before, we’re not doing this to get rich, we’re doing this to create impact and to provide people with an opportunity to contribute to their community through a service they already use. Our goal is to generate 24 million euros in donations within the next five years. Claudia: 10% might sound like a small figure but it can really have an impact. For example, one goood customer can feed a person in Africa in need with their monthly fee. Why is goood important for today’s world? Why now? Claudia: The world is changing. People are looking for ways to change the world and we offer people that possibility. Conscious consumerism is on the rise. Georg: It’s also important for non-profit organizations. They are taking on a lot of challenges and they are also struggling to get the financing they need. The majority of donations are made by people over the age of 70. Younger people often have not enough time or not enough money so we’re trying to make it as simple and as easy as possible for anyone to contribute. What are some of the challenges you’ve had to overcome? Has there been any resistance to your company? Claudia: To our mutual surprise, there was some resistance from the non-profit side. They had some skepticism about our intentions given our past experience in the telecommunications industry so we brought on board people from the non-profit sector and as a result, we completely revamped our business model, built the bridge to the non-profit sector, and that’s what made it all work. Georg: Financing, of course. You’re always walking a fine line. Every startup has this problem and the whole endeavor, because you’re trying to do something different, because you’re breaking all the rules, this creates a high pressure environment which can be challenging for everyone. What impact would you like to see goood have? Claudia: In addition to the social impact we’d like to have, our dream is that when we become profitable, 25% of our profits will be reinvested in other social businesses. And in order to walk the walk and not just talk the talk, 25% of shares of the company are in an association that we hope will one day be a social incubator that will help people get their ideas off the ground. Georg: Some people bring up the idea of competition and ask us what if everyone decides to copy our business model and give back? We just laugh and say that on that day, we’ll know we’ve won. So bring on the competition because nothing would make us happier. How can someone sign up for goood? Are there any costs? Claudia: It’s super easy and it’ll just take three minutes of your time. Go to our German website if you’re in Germany, our Austrian website if you’re in Austria, pick a package, and pick a project. There are no activation fees, no obligations, and you can keep your old number. From the very first day you sign up, you’ll be contributing to your social cause. How can members of Impact Hub help? Georg: Sign up! There’s a special offer code for Impact Hub Members which is: “impacthub”. The first 100 subscribers using this code will get a hardware voucher of 25 euros!

Take this time of year to unplug yourself from your busy day to day and recharge. As connected as we are to our technology, it’s often very difficult for people to unplug. Here are six suggestions to help you disconnect and make your upcoming holidays relaxing, slow, and phone-free: Analog activity day Don’t use a single thing that requires a battery. Play with Legos, play a board game, do a puzzle, do a crossword, do something that requires the use of more than just your amazing opposable thumbs tapping on a screen. Look to do active activities that you have to participate in, not passive ones where someone or something is feeding you your entertainment. Baking! Who doesn’t like a holiday treat? If you want to go extra old-school, don’t use a mixer! Bake cakes, cookies, and other holiday specialties. Do it with your closest friends or try to find a workshop where you can bake with strangers! The possibilities are endless. If you’re looking for suggestions as to what to bake, check out our post on christmas baking! Read a book Put your Kindle away. Read a tangible and real book that was printed on paper. The book should be heavy enough to at least work as an effective paperweight on a windy day. Tons of great books are published every day so go out and buy one! And I’m sure someone gave you one for your birthday that’s been lying on your night table neglected and unread. Brew some of your favorite tea, sit in a comfortable chair by the window, and enjoy. Write a letter Everyone loves a handwritten letter because it’s so rare these days. Use those handwriting skills that you slaved so hard to learn during your youth and write someone a letter. Spend an afternoon enjoying the process of writing slow where you think through what you want to write before writing it. There’s no need to rush unless you’re trying to get to the post office before it closes. Mindfulness It’s not about the past or the future. It’s about the here and now. Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment through meditation or other activities. It has been shown to reduce depression and anxiety so what are you waiting for? Take 10 minutes for yourself; breathe in, and breathe out. Make a present How about making a present instead of buying one? There are a lot of simple arts and crafts ideas that I guarantee someone will appreciate more than a gift card. To make it sustainable, see if you can’t reuse some of the things that are lying around your home or office. Make a dreamcatcher or a paper star! If you want to unplug this holiday season, then really unplug. Embrace many of the things you used to do when you were a kid. Don’t just look back on simpler times. Make your time simple. Happy holidays!","December 15, 2017","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cables-600x400.jpg"

Before we dive into the new year, we’d like to take a few minutes to look back and reflect on a few of the major milestones achieved over the last twelve months and raise a glass to everyone who participated in and supported our common mission of catalyzing change through social entrepreneurship. Here are five reasons we’re raising our glass to 2017. 1) We grew our community and found new ways to collaborate This year we reached over 500 members at Impact Hub Vienna, growing our community by bringing people with different backgrounds, skills, and resources into our network to collaborate. Our community team worked hard to bring together members to meet each other and share their entrepreneurial journey during weekly member lunches and our melange um vier sugar breaks. Through WineDown events like the Future of Cities, Future of Society, and Food Talks, we invited the larger ecosystem into our doors to not only meet our ventures, but to engage in meaningful conversations and contribute ideas around how we tackle important global challenges like mobility, food waste, food production, social inclusion, and more. We had over 2,000 people take part in these community events over the course of the year. 2) We built a new space to support later-stage entrepreneurs As the social impact ecosystem has matured, so too have our ventures. To support growing startup teams, Impact Hub opened 400 square meters of space on our new third floor. Nine teams moved in this November and have already made it their home. 3) Our program support reached new heights and area codes We also grew the capacity of our programs significantly in 2017, accelerating over 100 ventures last year between Accelerate, the Investment Ready Program, EOI, ADA, Re:Wien, Vielfalter, WWF, Found!, and Innovate4Nature. This year, we also continued to share our knowledge of impact support by scaling several of our programs outside of Austria. Our Investment Ready Program (IRP) is now active in Munich and is on track to launch in four additional cities worldwide in 2018. Social Impact Award (SIA) has scaled into 18 countries since opening in 2009, with 8 locations opened in 2017 alone. After incubating 172 promising ventures from across their locations this year, SIA hosted all 55 award-winning teams at the SIA Summit in Belgrade this October. Together, SIA and IRP hosted Western Balkan Impact Day as part of the Belgrade Venture Forum 2017– the largest investment event in the region. 4) We hosted our most successful CEE Impact Day event to date The sixth edition of our CEE Impact Day had over 200 participants this year, bringing together investors from all over the region to meet our Investment Ready Program Ventures. Key stakeholders met to explore the growing investment and collaboration opportunities and enrich toe social impact ecosystem. 5) We celebrated alongside our members Our members and Impact Hub alumni celebrated many champagne-cork moments themselves this year. Whether it was winning competitions or investment capital, adding new employees or products, or figuring out new ways to serve their beneficiaries, our members reached many of their own milestones in 2017. Here are just a few we’d like to mention: WGE, Schoolfox, Vello Bikes, WADI by Helioz, Hut & Stiel, and Refugees Code were all chosen to participate in ORF 1’s live broadcast of Austria Can! and WADI was selected as the winning project. Hut & Stil won the Green Stadt 2016 Competition and 15,000 Euro. Katharina Moser, founder of MOSAIK, and Martin Wesian, founder of HELIOZ, were featured at the closing session of the political symposium of European Forum Alpbach. Katharina Norden, the founder of Three Coins, and Vesela Tanaskovic the founder of Afforest4Future were selected as one of the 100 global changemakers of Singularity University in Silicon Valley. Perrine Schober, founder of Shades Tours was selected to speak at TEDxTUWien and share her thought leadership on how to turn weaknesses into strengths. Congrats to all our members and the many accomplishments you worked to achieve this year! A big thanks to our members and community As we close out the year, we’d like to give a big thank you to all our members and supporters. Without your help, none of the milestones we reached this year would have been possible. We look forward to working together to achieve even more impact in 2018.

"169","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/01/11/new-year-new-make-healthy-habits/","ImpactHub","New Year, New You! Making Healthy Habits"," Do you find yourself in that same new year’s resolution cycle every year? Things feel fresh, you’ve made your resolutions, and you’re excited for the new year! But, a few weeks or a few months later, you still haven’t filled out your business canvas, begun your search for a co-founder, or even started to floss. Time to change your thinking and make healthy habits instead or resolutions. Demotivation sets in, you get down on yourself, and your resolutions seem like pipe dreams that are further away than ever before. With a new year comes new habits, new goals, and especially new challenges. Making decisions is an important first step, but executing them is the biggest hurdle you’ll face. In order to make this new year a successful one, you need to approach change in the right way. Here are some strategies that we think are the most effective. Photo Credit: Aneta PawlikBe SMART You’ve probably seen or used this system before in a work-related setting but how about adapting it for your own life? SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Organize your new habits with this framework and if your goal is particularly large and requires multiple steps, break them down into smaller ones. Specific: Your goal should be clear and specific. Do not be ambiguous. Answer the five W’s of Who, What, Where, When, and Why to further clarify and define your resolution. Who is involved? What are you doing? Where are you going to achieve this? When are you going to do it? Why are you doing this? Measurable: You need to be able to measure and track your progress towards your goals. If your changes involve number targets, use them. If your goals are more qualitative, define what evidence or behaviour you need to see to know that you’ve achieved your desired outcome. Achievable: It has to be realistic. Ambition is great but overly ambitious changes to your habits can be your downfall. Whatever your goal is, make sure that it’s achievable because you’re only going to set yourself up for disappointment if it’s not. Ask yourself how you can accomplish your goal? If you can’t answer that question then your resolution is probably unrealistic. Relevant: This is the Why question that you answered earlier. Why is this goal relevant to you? Does it align with other relevant goals in your life? If not, then this change may not be the best one to tackle right now. Time-bound: This is the when of the five W’s. Your new habit is specific, measurable, achievable, and relevant. Now make it a product of time. Set up specific milestones and deadlines with specific dates to get you towards your goal. Make a plan Strategize. Attack these changes as if it’s something to conquer. The SMART system is just one way of making a plan. There are other planning methods that might suit you better. If you want to make good on developing new habits, make a plan. Photo Credit: Aneta PawlikTell someone about it Whether this is the first step or the last step, make sure at some point that you tell at least one person about your goals. The more people you tell, the better. It makes what you want to achieve more real when you tell somebody about it. If you can, recruit the people you tell into a support system. Build a team around you to help you when you fall down. Your goals are yours but nobody said you had to do them alone. Be kind to yourself We’re not always the ideal version of ourselves as much as we try to be and that’s okay. Nobody likes to fail, however, failure is how you learn. You learn about what went wrong, how it went wrong, and what you can do better next time. Re-frame your setbacks and failures as learning opportunities. These events don’t define you, but how you react to them will. So, cut yourself some slack, dust yourself off, and keep at it. Just do it! And celebrate! You’ve made your plan and you’ve told anyone under the sun who was willing to lend an ear. Now’s the time to execute. You’ve already thought about what you need to do so don’t overthink it. Just go out there and do it. When you’re one step closer to your goal, celebrate! It’s important to recognize your achievements so make a point of doing so. What are you waiting for? The new year’s already started.","January 11, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blog-Image-Guide-healthy-habits-600x400.jpg"
"170","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/01/17/spotlight-dont-grow-older-grow-wisr-follow-interview-wisr/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: Don’t grow older, grow WisR!"," Only seven months ago, we spoke with Klaudia Bachinger about her dreams for her fledgling startup WisR. Since then, the company has added two Co-founders (Carina Roth, Chief Financial Officer, and Martin Melcher, Chief Technical Officer) and everything is now in full flight. Employees were hired, awards were won, partnerships were built, and grants were given because Klaudia, Carina, and Martin believed in WisR’s mission: to connect skilled and motivated Silver Agers (people in early retirement age or before) with jobs thus helping build the bridge between generations. With everything that’s happened in such a short time, it’s clear that many others believe as well. Klaudia, Carina, and Martin sat down to talk about how they decided to work together, their plans for the upcoming year, and how the challenges keep coming. What’s changed since we last spoke? Klaudia: A lot! The last time we spoke I was alone. As positive as I sounded in that interview, not long after, I was ready to quit because it was getting really hard. I felt like I was not making any progress. I needed a team and had the hardest time finding people who wanted the same things. I gave myself two months to find someone. Luckily I met Carina and Martin and now there’s an office, a company, and most importantly, a team. Carina and Martin, what made you decide to join WisR as Co-Founders? Carina: Martin and I pretty much joined at the same time but I met Klaudia through Lemmings! I asked her what she was doing and she gave me her one-liner and it stayed with me. It was her enthusiasm for WisR and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it so I texted her the next day, asked her to go for coffee, and the rest is history. Martin: Klaudia and I met at Smart Ninja where I was a trainer. At one point, she told me about WisR and it just so happened that around that time I was looking for a change. During the last five years, I’ve worked purely on tech-focused projects and I thought a social project would be something good. It’s something I haven’t done before and what appealed to me was that it’s not just about building a great product–it’s also about building the bigger and greater idea behind it as well. How is the working dynamic between you three? What characteristics do you think make you work well together? Klaudia: What we did at the beginning was have everyone fill out a Co-Founder questionnaire to figure out what everyone wants and what values are important to them. As it turns out, we’re all pretty similar in those aspects. Carina: Our competencies, what interests us, and our roles are fairly separate so we naturally don’t step on each other’s toes. All our abilities and interests complement each other. I’m the numbers girl dealing with finances, Klaudia is the creative and leadership force, Martin is the tech and research genius. The balance is just there. How do you deal with disagreements? Martin: It’s only recently that we’ve had any kind of disagreements but we’ve managed to sort those out. Now that we’re bigger with more people and bigger tasks ahead of us, it becomes clear that sometimes we’re not all on the same page and that leads to some minor disagreements. Before, when we were smaller and it was just the three of us, disagreements didn’t exist. Klaudia: It was actually kind of fun when we all realized that we were having our first disagreement. We all felt it as in it was clear that something didn’t feel right and we asked ourselves what just happened, why did we disagree, so the next morning we sat down, talked about it, and worked it out. Carina: Open communication and direct communication is something we have in our values. We have to stay humble and keep in mind that we have common goals. WisR is always bigger than our egos. Klaudia: We actually do have a hashtag that says: less ego, more talent! #LessEgoMoreTalent Have there been any unexpected challenges so far? Klaudia: Coordinating everyone and keeping everyone informed is a challenge. Martin: We also had to let a couple of people go early on which is difficult when you’re just starting. Klaudia: That was really tough. We liked both these people very much on a personal basis but it just wasn’t the right fit for the team. Telling someone that they are not the right person for the position or for your team was probably one of the toughest challenges so far. What are some of the milestones or successes that you’ve achieved in the past seven months? Carina: We received a €100,000 public grant! And we moved into our first real office on the still new third floor of the Hub! Klaudia: We created the GmbH. We are now finally an established company; a founded company. And we launched our new website and got our first paying customer! Martin: On the technical side, I managed to build and implement a software stack that I’ve always wanted to build and it consists of the best tools that I’m aware of. I’m really proud that I put this together and that’s it’s working! How has the Hub helped you in achieving these milestones? Klaudia: I think I said it before but I’ll say it again. If the Hub wasn’t here, WisR wouldn’t exist. It’s the network, the great people that are part of the Hub, the support, and the positive spirit that keeps pushing us forward. The RE: WIEN program was also a big help. Carina: Yes, we met great mentors through the program and some are still our advisers! It’s also a great vibe here and we love the space. Do you have an example of a memorable mentor moment? Klaudia: There have been a few. Before I met Carina and Martin, like I said before, I was ready to give up. But before quitting I spoke with a mentor and that helped a lot. He asked me great questions and got me to see what I had achieved. I was quite down and was expressing all my worries and fears and it helped me realize that I shouldn’t give up because I wanted to give it one more go and also that it’s okay to be and feel vulnerable. Another moment one was when I had to fire someone. How do you fire someone you actually like? So with another mentor we role played and went through all the possible reactions and scenarios. It helped me realize that it was my fault for bringing on this person so it definitely changed how I saw the whole situation. And it helped answer questions like: What do you say if they’re angry? What do you say if they cry? I still have to lead this tough conversation no matter what happens. You can’t learn this stuff in school. It’s something you can only learn from someone who’s been through it. Klaudia, looking back at the past seven months, could you imagine that you are where you are now? Klaudia: No, absolutely not, It wasn’t until we had the Christmas party and all of the team and our supporters were there where it really dawned on me how big this has become. Like I said before, I was on the verge of giving up so to go from there to here is huge. I try to visualize where we are going to be but the past seven months have gone way beyond my expectations and I couldn’t be more grateful! What are your goals for the upcoming year? Carina: We have very clear milestones. From a product standpoint, there’s the finalization of the platform, the creation of the web app, and the development of the matching algorithm. Sales or revenue-wise, we’ve just started our Pioneer Partner program where we approach corporations to get them onboard to help us grow even if we can’t offer them a finalized product. And of course, further funding! Klaudia: Testing the business model, finding the right product market fit, and showing how what we’re doing is sustainable. Martin: Growing the tech team is very important to me and also being able to pay people what they deserve to be paid. What advice can you give fellow Hubbers who are just starting their own ventures? Carina: Get a team. Klaudia: Get a team that compliments you and that you’re aligned with vision-wise. No man or woman is an island and remember that it’s incredibly hard, you will doubt yourself, but if you believe in it, keep going.","January 17, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WisR-Banner-600x400.jpg"
"171","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/01/30/book-round-up-the-future-is-now/","ImpactHub","Book Round Up: The Future is Now","I found myself re-reading George Orwell’s 1984. The avid reader’s curse is to find solace within dusty volumes pulled from precarious piles. Reading 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and Handmaid’s Tale provide little comfort amidst the modern life’s turmoil. My usual future oriented book round up was making me depressed. The future is now, the rapid change in technology constantly reminds me. Maybe I need to look elsewhere for my future worlds fix in January. While Orwell wrote books and essays covering everything from the banal to the satirical, he remains one of the best futurists we have ever seen. While he is best known for 1984 and Animal Farm, his minor essays, Notes on Nationalism and You and the Atomic Bomb, strike a chord with new modern audiences. Orwell’s worlds are not ones in which I wish to live. I have no desire to see languages devolve into Newspeak or where “four legs are good, but two are better”. My assumption is most people in the Hub community feel the same. Why else would we be working towards a better future? The blog team thought about it for a while and we put together a list of books offering positive and thought-provoking futures while attempting to solve today’s dilemmas. We threw in a comic book at the end. The weekend is coming and something fun to read is a great way to while away the hours on a cold and grey winter day. Anything by Carlo Ratti Carlo Ratti is one of the greatest futurists in our time. We know listing an author is a dodge, however, his three books reimagine the way we will approach everything from transportation infrastructure to sewers. Check out an interview he gave while at an MIT conference in Vienna. In 100 Years: Leading Economists Predict the Future The world’s leading economists weigh in on the debate, including Nobel Laureates. This book covers everything from the crisis/recovery cycle and persistent inequality. Several scenarios are gloomy; however, many are positive. The book synopsis states, “economists may be better equipped to predict the future than science fiction writers”. Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 Remember all the things in Star Trek we wanted? Tri-corders, visual calls, sliding doors, holo-decks. We are getting there and it is taking time. Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku takes his readers through the current technologies on the market, what is ahead, and what this means for future technologies. Kaku considers real issues we confront now, who will have jobs and what nations will be wealthy? He argues for scientific principles to create safe regulations surrounding how far and fast we go. The Extreme Future: The Top Trends That Will Reshape the World in the Next 20 Years Dr. James Canton has advised three presidents, worked for Apple, and founded FutureLab. He is a high-profile futurist and author. In this book he presents his “guide to navigating the twenty-first century”. He covers topics from medicine to the environment. It can sometimes be a bit gloomy, for example, the predicted world-wide power struggle due to China’s economic rise. Other aspects are markedly positive, take for instance, how new medical technologies will enhance our daily lives. The Future We Want: Radical Ideas for a New Century The editors of this collection call it a manifesto. The book proposes radical changes and dares to think in new directions, for example, “what would business look like without Wall Street”. The ten contributors propose “utopian and possible” solutions to the quagmires in which we currently find ourselves. Expansive and pointed, the book simultaneously tries to answer “what if” in concrete ways. Fun Fiction for the Weekend: Tom Strong We are only including this because it is cool. The creator of V for Vendetta and The Watchmen, Alan Moore, leaves the gritty future he creates within those pages to imagine something new and positive. While the story starts in the 1920s it imagines bold parallel universes and all the good science can do for humanity. And what good is a science super hero without a maniacal supervillain? Enter his arch nemesis Paul Saveen, whose science-oriented plots are as convoluted as you might think.","January 30, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-round-up--600x400.jpg"
"172","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/01/edtech/","ImpactHub","EdTech: Bringing Education Closer to the Digital Era"," Education is an institution that has remained largely unchanged for decades. Technology is here to change that. But what is EdTech? EdTech stands for Education Technology. It’s the use of technology to improve how we consume, access, facilitate, and disseminate education. Many agree that the current education system and approaches to education have their shortcomings. Now, due to mass saturation and low-cost of technology, entrepreneurs are leveraging the potential of technology to innovate new approaches to learning. Whether it’s the gamification of learning through virtual reality techniques, hosting entire degree programs online, or facilitating better parent-teacher communication through online platforms, EdTech has already made some impressive strides toward bringing education closer to the digital era. Here are a few examples of EdTech to shed some light on the tech revolution: Massive open online courses A notable example of EdTech that you might’ve heard of or even participated in are massive open online courses offered by services such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy. This is when anyone from anywhere can take an online course. There’s no geographic or physical limitations. You can take these courses from anywhere in the world and an unlimited number of students can participate. It has been revolutionary in its ability to bring education to places and people that have limited access and opportunity. Learning management systems We all rightfully focus on the quality of the education to be delivered but what about all the work that goes into delivering education? That’s where a learning management system comes in. If you’re a student, you’re likely already using a form of this. An open-source example is Moodle which is widely used here in Austria. These systems help teachers to track progress, deliver assignments, and manage students. This makes the administrative aspect of a teacher’s life easier allowing them to focus on the most important part of education: teaching. Collaborative learning Also known as social learning, this is the use of technological solutions to facilitate peer-to-peer learning among students. It is based on the fundamental idea that the best way to learn is to teach what you know to others. Collaborative learning can take the form of wikis, blogs, videos or podcasts with the ultimate goal being the creation of a community whose organizational focus is learning. In this context, a teacher would act more as a facilitator. What’s next? As you can see, there are many applications that exist under the umbrella of EdTech. New technological solutions are being worked on every day and with each iteration, they will only get better and better. It is the new frontier in the field of education and while the solutions hold great promise, we should keep in mind that technology will not solve every problem. These solutions might not be the preferred way of learning for all students. Sometimes, being face-to-face with a person who is focused on you and giving you their attention is what a student needs. This has value and this kind of experience can never be replaced by technology.

"173","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/06/frontlines-edtech-alfred-hofer-vision-education/","ImpactHub","EdTech Frontlines: Alfred Hofer, Vision Education"," Alfred Hofer is the Head of Business Development at Vision Education, a developer of language learning and vocabulary training applications for mobile and the web. Their current projects include: LearnMatch, a sports-themed and sponsor-financed language learning mobile App, and phase6 Berufe, a business oriented language training app. Given his passion for EdTech and its importance in Vision Education’s mission, Alfred stopped by to talk about the promise of EdTech, its capabilities, and how we’re just scratching the surface of its potential. How would you define EdTech? As it relates to Vision Education, I would say it’s taking the didactic knowledge that we already had that existed in books, the analog systems, and bringing it to the digital realm by adding additional digital benefits and state-of-the-art possibilities. For us, it’s leveraging the popularity of the smartphone, using the existing hardware, putting educational software on it, and enhancing it with more in-depth information. What are the benefits of EdTech for the learner? Since a person has their smartphone with them wherever they go, if it’s loaded with the educational software, it gives the learner more flexibility and enriched content. If you’re waiting for a train or waiting in line, you can take your phone out and do your vocabulary training. EdTech can also facilitate new ways of learning and training. One that I find interesting can be best explained with an example. Let’s say you’re learning English and you’re preparing a presentation and you find a new word. You can mark that specific word on your computer or phone and it will be automatically added to your vocabulary training lesson on your learning app. That allows the learner to fluidly build their own personalized lesson plan. This isn’t possible without a digital solution and the seamless integration of PC and mobile. What are the elements that are required in order to make an application successful? I can’t speak for other EdTech companies who have different focuses but for us, what’s important for LearnMatch is to bring joy and fun into the learning experience and we’ve done this by adding gamification elements. For example, since our target group for English with LearnMatch is A1 and A2 learners, they would be mainly between the ages of 9 and 15. So they can compete against each other in real-time in a LiveMatch and there’s rankings, badges, team competitions, and monthly tournaments with prizes donated from our sponsors. While we are specifically targeting this age group with the gamification elements, we’ve also found that this appeals to adults as well who are learning Spanish or Portuguese and playing LiveMatches with their family and friends. How important is it to work with teachers and educators? It’s always important to work with experts. Which expert depends on the audience that you’re trying to reach. If it’s schools, then yes, it is absolutely vital to work with teachers. You need to cooperate with teachers, educators, and the textbook publishing houses because they not only own the content but have 20 or 25 years of expertise on the content and the didactics in school. If the audience is corporate, executive, or management, you need to consider working with training and certification providers so that you can leverage their expertise as well. But of course, those different target groups need different arguments and deal structures to get involved. What do you think are some of the challenges that EdTech faces? Most companies in the EdTech space are startups so they don’t have the financial power and abilities of the old-fashioned traditional education suppliers. If you want to expand globally, there are limitations. Speed becomes a factor where people might want your product but you can’t expand fast enough to deliver it. The legacy players are also trying to digitize their offerings. They have a lot of money but have had varying levels of success. So either you find your niche market and compete alongside them or you cooperate with them by starting strategic partnerships where both sides benefit. What are some challenges that Vision Education has faced? Has there been any resistance to your app from teachers? There’s been no resistance so far fortunately. We’ve gotten great positive feedback especially from teachers who praise the fun elements of LearnMatch. Some are amazed to see kids actually learning on their own! And we really value any constructive feedback from teachers, parents, and users worldwide because they are on the ground level interacting with the app. Their feedback can only make what we offer better. How do you see the future of EdTech? What impact do you think it will have? Flexibility in learning and an increased trend in “small portions”. It’s always on and available. Companies will have lower organizational costs for training sessions. It’s going to be a co-existence with the analog solutions but I see EdTech solutions taking a big piece of market share in the long run like we’ve seen in the music, film, and publishing industries. And it will be the innovative startups that will be the ones disrupting the whole sector. What are some of the potentials of the technology you think are worth exploring? When it comes to language learning, audio and speech recognition will become more and more important. Right now, our interface is touch-oriented but since a lot of language learning is speaking, designing audio interfaces shows a lot of promise. Augmented and virtual reality are also interesting avenues. Since they are immersive, they can be a great benefit to learners for subjects that require a more immersive experience. Think about learning about the galaxies, stars, and constellations. Putting on VR goggles and actually navigating the cosmos sounds far more effective than learning it from the page. What impact would you like to see Vision Education have? We hope to expand our global reach through our partnerships with NGOs such as Pro Mujer, who support women and children in Latin and South America. We’re currently trying to set up a similar program with a NGO in India. Our goal is to support language learning initiatives around the world because we believe there’s a social responsibility that comes with having the technology. These partnerships are very rewarding and are possible because the distribution of education through technological solutions costs far less than traditional books. Overall, since we’re a language learning company, we want people to understand each other better and communicate more effectively with one another. Like our partners all around the globe, we believe that education and language learning is an important investment in the future of each individual. If I’m interested in EdTech, how do I get involved? Just reach out to the companies. Everyone has their own specializations so find the one that you’re interested and say hello!

Skip all presents and invest all the time into your family and friends, going for relaxing walks and cooking a delicious meal. Cooking could become a whole-day experience, starting with a brunch and cocktails in the afternoon, ending with a zero-waste holiday or birthday feast. For birthdays, you can think about ways to spend time with the special person, make a memory as opposed to giving them something else to store. If you really want to give a gift, perhaps you can consider a new option. There are many makers in Vienna who work exclusively in upcycled goods, you can find them at events like Edelstoffe and Feschmarkt. Certainly, you can also make presents for your loved ones – hand knitted scarves, embroidered handkerchiefs, or hand sewn pyjama pants are always welcome gifts. If you are looking for great ideas come and check out LUNZERS Maß-Greißlerei as they also offer a huge variety of zero waste cosmetics and household-equipment, especially if you don’t have time to make something by hand. Family and Friend Holidays: Sometimes we focus too much on the material trappings around any holiday; presents, eggs, chocolates, costumes, etc. It amounts to a large volume of stuff that no one wants or needs. Maybe spending time doing things with your family and friends Is a better way forward. Go see a movie together, take a nature walk and enjoy the changes from winter to spring. As the weather warms, go for a picnic, and admire Vienna’s gardens. These are all waste free options and create stronger bonds between loved ones. lunzers greißlerei 14.3.2014 (c) julia fuchs Holidays for others: If you feel like giving back, look out for community events or cooking-session in homeless shelters.

"175","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/08/ed-tech-sector-challenges-2018/","ImpactHub","Ed Tech Sector Challenges 2018","Ed Tech is a highly visible sector in the entrepreneurial and start-up markets. In August 2017, The Guardian reported the industry would be worth €146 Billion by the year 2020. Despite the sunny financial outlook, every sector faces challenges. Ed Tech Magazine reported in 2015 the top five challenges faced by the education technology sector were budget limits, inadequate professional training, resistance to change, inadequate infrastructure, and unreliable hardware and software. In 2017, eLearning Industry, a website dedicated to promotion of the industry sector, reported the top four challenges being resistance to change, cost limitation, the disconnect between educational theory and action-based platforms, and the volume of offerings within the sector. 2018 Sector Challenges Earlier this January, SI News reported the largest challenges facing the education sector, not only the technology portion, will be the changing job market, increasing the focus on social and emotional intelligence, and educational technology. Ed Tech promises to revolutionise the education – everything from “homework assignments and marking to giving students with special needs the support they require”, according to SI News. However, educators are asking for new and innovative offerings, according to an article published by Forbes Magazine earlier this month. The blog WizIQ reports the top challenges within the technology segment of the sector as lack of universal accessibility, absence of uniform content, lack of professional training, low in classroom adoption rates, cost limitations, and high volume of competing product offerings. Not much has changed within the traditional education market segment. Sector Fragmentation WizIQ reports one of the largest disruptive trends to hit the sector in 2018 will be mobile learning. “A Flurry Data report suggests a 69% increase in in-app time in 2016. This metamorphosis in the EdTech industry led to an increased reliance on mobile-learning, empowering students to adapt to advanced educational technology cutting across socio-economic and geographical boundaries” In mid-2017, The Guardian had identified this trend, stating “while many startups focus on schools, others recognise that education in the 21st century doesn’t just rely on the classroom”. There is a whole segment of self-learning within the digital market place. “It’s not just teachers looking for new, fun products to aid with developing 21st-century skills, but parents too as they look to supplement their child’s education out of school,” says Filippo Yacob, CEO of Primo Toys, the company behind award-winning toy Cubetto told The Guardian, in the same article. “The things that we need to learn today aren’t necessarily learned at school. Education is often based on a very traditional system which doesn’t always accommodate new ways of learning and new ways of thinking,” Yacob continued. “The world of learning and play are becoming closer together and are becoming more integrated,” says CEO Bethany Koby to The Guardian in 2017. Home Grown Talent Alfred Hofer of Vision Education chatted with us earlier this month about their offerings for every language learner. The LearnMatch app, developed by Vision Education, offers high quality language training. Last year was a big year for Vision Education. They launched their initial LearnMatch app and partnered with some of the largest companies in Austria to provide access to language learning opportunities. For 2018, they hope the app will “have a greater international reach”. From a local market segment perspective the hope is LearnMatch will be adopted “across Austrian classrooms as its unique gamification-elements and its LiveMatch feature gives kids and young people a motivational boost for vocabulary-training”. The experience will be a new one for parents and teachers looking for innovative language learning offerings, Hofer continues. Echoing Koby above, Hofer says “learning almost happens automatically when embedded in a playful and emotional context like football – all that is LearnMatch”.

"176","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/13/marketing-for-startups/","ImpactHub","Ten Commandments of Marketing for Startups","Your startup took off like a rocket: you have your website, your social media, your grand vision. Now you want to attract customers and investors so you start thinking about marketing. Here’s the issue: you have no idea where to begin; your business is too small to afford a marketing specialist and in general you are not sure what marketing really is. I put together this list of ten commandments for a healthy marketing strategy for startups to get onto the right path! #1 Start with marketing in mind I am a marketing consultant so of course, I will tell you that marketing should be your main focus right next to your product. Why? Because a good marketing strategy is defined by and rooted in the vision of your business. Because to quote Simon Sinek, “people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” Ideally, you develop your marketing strategy alongside your vision, product concept and positioning but many entrepreneurs I spoke to only think about marketing when it comes to the selling phase. Deep breath, not all is lost if you find yourself in the same spot too! Pull everything you did for your business plan and start your marketing strategy from there. Your brand idea will dictate your copy. Your target audience will determine what channels you need to use. Your business end goal will polish the short and long-term goals of your marketing efforts. #2 Complete your documentation I say, ‘brand guidelines, marketing strategy document, marketing personas, SEO worksheet, website content plan….’ You say, ‘Um, bitte?’. Be that person and create a complete and detailed documentation of your marketing strategy. Have one document, where your wholesome marketing plan can be looked at and improved, polished, and referred to. The internet is full of free templates you can get your hands on. Once you create these documents you will see that putting your marketing strategy into words helps you keep track of your campaigns, allocate your resources and start seeing the big picture. #3 Become a full-stack marketer If you open your own business, you have to go in with the mindset of a can-do person. Come to terms with the fact that you will have to learn a lot of things on your own to help your startup thrive. Take time to enrol in marketing courses on Udemy or Skillshare, attend workshops and training. You can also check out free resources, such as: Google Analytics Academy The Begginers Guide to SEO by Moz Google Online Marketing Challenge HubSpot Inbound Marketing Course #4 Set up a feedback system Your startup’s testing phase is when you can hammer out your marketing strategy. Make sure you create a solid feedback system for your product, such as asking customers for testimonials, sending them a post-purchase evaluation form or a regular survey. Monitor your Google Analytics to check the strength of your online offering, run focus groups to hear opinions about your advertising campaign before it launches. Make sure you check your social media analytics regularly to determine what content makes your audience tick. #5 Be smart about your resources Real talk: you have limited resources in terms of manpower and finances. You rely on goodwill, free content and try to spend your money in a smart way. It’s part of being in the startup business. So why are you not allocating your time and physical resources in a more efficient way? I recently did a series of free marketing consultations at the Impact Hub Vienna. Every single person I spoke to had a complex marketing plan but actually lacked time and expertise to action it. Time and time again I speak to solopreneurs, who just launched and landed 5 social media profiles, weekly blogs, a newsletter and oh, they also do a podcast. Focus on less but be consistent. Be realistic about what you can do and don’t beat yourself up about not delivering the amount of content you think you should. Automate where you can and templatise like there was no tomorrow. #6 Own your channels In the era of pay to play and constant algorithm changes, it’s impossible to succeed on social media and collect large following the same way startups did just 2 years ago. This is why it is so important to invest more time into the channels you own such as your website and your newsletter list. Tomorrow Facebook might decide that Business Pages are invisible unless they pay but nobody can touch your newsletter list. #7 Invest into your customers When somebody buys from you, they are your kings and queens. Your customer is more important than a potential customer. Make sure you appreciate that relationship and invest into amplifying its meaning. Make sure to comment on the social media post they wrote about you and reshare it. Get their testimonial. Thank them in a social media message. Send them a follow-up email with a special offer. Remember their birthday. Such small things will earn you true customer loyalty. #8 Learn the basics of good copywriting Content is important but how do you get people to visit your page or click on the sign-up button? You flirt with them through a good copy. Your feedback loops, contact with your customers, social media analytics, website traffic data will give you a good indication what copy does it for your target audience. Don’t wait to brush up on this valuable skill though! You should definitely check out CopyHackers to learn how to test and polish your writing to start converting viewers into participants. #9 Don’t be afraid to re-evaluate The beauty of testing your startup concept is the fact that you get to re-evaluate and improve. However, don’t assume that the testing phase ever ends. Your marketing strategy is subject to literally everything; from the variable economic situation, changing buying tendencies, social media algorithm updates, to new data policy. Keep improving but don’t be afraid to re-evaluate when you have to and accept it as part of the process. #10 Dare to be different There is the invisible benchmark or marketing for startups than have every new venture set up a Facebook page, reach to local newspapers, host an event, participate in online giveaways and a number of other online must-dos. Many people give in and burn out by the time they get the opportunity to snatch a significant market share. Grow at your own pace with your own rules. You don’t have to have a robust content marketing plan or work on your Instagram when you don’t really believe these tools will serve your vision. Do things differently. Think about your resources, your skills and your passion. In the end of a day, your marketing strategy relies on your consistency and creativity. Protect these assets by avoiding things getting too dull.","February 13, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/book-round-up--600x400.jpg"
"177","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/16/winners-vielfalter-accelerator/","ImpactHub","Winners of the Vielfalter Accelerator Program"," Vielfalter is a startup accelerator program supported by Impact Hub Vienna, Kalkalpen National Park, WKO of Steyr, the regional development agency of Upper Austria, the Scheuch Family Foundation, and the Leader Region Traunviertler Alpenvorland. Vielfalter was looking for innovative entrepreneurial ideas in the fields of ecological agriculture, sustainable tourism, food, health, and wood, that will have a positive effect on the Kalkalpen National Park region while creatively using its diverse resources. Every contestant attended an acceleration program which, depending on their needs, educated them on topics such as impact modeling, business modeling, financial planning, and sales and marketing. Due to the guidance and support provided by the accelerator, contestants developed their businesses quickly putting many of them in a prime position to win prizes. Here are the 4 winners of Vielfalter who were recently announced at an event in Steyr, Austria. Obstraupe Receiver of the €8,000 first prize, the Obstraupe is a harvester developed by David Brunmayr and his team at Verein Paradizer. It’s designed to harvest orchards efficiently and cost-effectively without damaging the fruits. Fruit orchards are vital ecosystems that contain over 5,000 different species of plants and animals. However, over the last 60 years, 85-90% of fruit trees have disappeared and the trend shows no sign of stopping. The Obstraupe is designed to push back and reverse this trend by offering farms and individuals a low-cost tool to harvest their fruit trees, keeping orchards, and the ecosystem around them, viable and thriving. Kalkalpen.Wild Winner of the €6,000 second prize, Kalkalpen.Wild offers a local and sustainable alternative to lovers of wild game. The Kalkalpen National Park area is home to a large variety of wild game untouched by the effects of modern farming or animal husbandry. Due to the structure of the local agriculture, animals rarely come into contact with things like pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers. Kalkalpen.Wild is looking to build up their premium brand, offering a local solution to wild game that uses lead-free ammunition while building awareness concerning the dangers that lead-usage poses to biodiversity. Spreissl Spreissl and its inventor Katharina Salcher-Aigner is the winner of the €4,000 third prize. Spreissl is a regionally produced, sustainable and carbon-neutral firewood. It is made from domestic, PEFC-certified and air-dried wood from the Kalkalpen National Park region and packed in recyclable wooden crates, jute bags, or cardboard boxes. Normally, firewood is packed in plastic and imported from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and other countries further east. Verein Bergwiesen Last but not least is the winner of the €8,000 special prize, Verein Bergwiesen. Their mission is to support the conservation of the biodiversity in the Kalkalpen National Park region by revitalizing and protecting the meadows of the mountains. Since they started two years ago, Bergwiesen has revitalized 25 hectares of slopes and meadows allowing for the regeneration and increased biodiversity of plants. Their long-term plan is to sell high-quality hay and pellet-food for horses and rodents from the revitalized areas.","February 16, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-16-at-2.15.03-PM-1-600x400.png"
"178","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/02/27/social-media-a-fuel-for-education/","ImpactHub","Social Media:  A Fuel for Education","One of my first essays at high school was about negative aspects of Facebook. I lamented about it destroying our relationships. Back then I understood it as a platform for wasting time and pointed out its overall meaningless. It never crossed my mind that a few years later I will participate in a Facebook group class for one of the college courses I took. Let alone, that it will become one of the essential tools for interaction and learning; a fuel for education. It was heavily snowing in Zagreb and public transport was blocked. During the evening I received a message on a Facebook chat from my professor. Accompanied with a link the message said: “Since it’s not possible to have a class tomorrow, join Facebook event I created for our session. We will discuss research on International Journalism. Click attend so I can mark your presence.” Not only was it considerate, but in a way creative. In 2011, not everyone was so keen on Facebook, especially in Croatia. Using it as a substitute for a class and a new learning method was definitely a breakthrough. But it didn’t stop there. Later on, the flourishing of various sorts of helpful social media tools for learning made them inevitable in one student’s life. Educational Platforms Take for example learning management systems, such as Moodle or Schoology. Their multifunctional characteristics enhance studying and actually make it possible. These networking software’s serve as administrative platforms for delivering educational programs Social media functions are integrated in the systems of LMS. Activities such as chats, videos or forums benefit students and improve their efforts. This way they have better reach and effect, especially when they include live conferences, webinars etc. Nowadays, education is more than just attending courses. We might as well learn from our networks, friends and stumbling upon news, so-called informal or incidental learning. Invariably it stems from our social media accounts. They have gained credibility as a source of information dispersed from institutions and organizations as well as users and audiences. What makes it even more appealing is the interaction, participation and engagement it ensures. Research Methods Besides learning, social media are effective when conducting data collection for a research. Tinder as a methodological tool? Yeah, right. Hold on, it is right. Even more than right. For sociologists it is almost an unavoidable platform to connect with people from troublesome locations. Imagine a scenario where you are alone in a war affected foreign country, not speaking the language and doing ethnographical research. It comes in handy, doesn’t it? Not only for meeting up, but for actual learning about the people, culture and the country. Monitoring what the users are doing on social media channels is also growing. This helps with observational data in research processes. Platforms as CrowdFlower enable this method. Last, but not Least…Networking I couldn’t wrap my mind around latest news about research without Twitter. It is my number one tool for following advances in research fields of my interest. I connect with experts, professors and research teams, who regularly post about their published pieces or attended conferences. In terms of education, it might not be that helpful, but the goal of networking adds up to entire social media usage.

"179","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/03/08/international-womens-day-women-and-entrepreneurial-success/","ImpactHub","International Women’s Day: Women and Entrepreneurial Success","The narrative is the same globally. There are fewer women entrepreneurs than men. However, women are more successful than men while self-employed or starting businesses. In honour of International Women’s Day, we thought we would pass along the research findings and help the whole community achieve greater success. A statement in the above paragraph requires qualification. Fortune magazine reports, “Companies helmed by women entrepreneurs had 13% higher revenues than those run by men, and finished 9% above the average for all entrepreneurs surveyed”. Fortune magazine went further and even broke the statistics down for women by generation, “Millennial women also reported even higher revenues than their already-above-average gender group for the coming year: for women, revenues were 9% above the overall average, and for women ‘millennipreneurs,’ it was 22%”. The Big Question This really does beg the question, why. What are the secrets to women and entrepreneurial success? There has been a lot of research performed on this topic. Virgin reported on a 2015 study by the University of Cambridge and Barclays and distills this reason from the available research, “where male entrepreneurs are likely to take risks to grow their business quickly and then find an exit route, women tend to aim for controlled growth and avoid gambling”. Forbes magazine lists five reasons why women are more successful than their male counterparts with respect to entrepreneurial pursuits. Their list, derived from the Center of Entrepreneurship’s 2015 report, includes: “Women are better calculated risk takers, women are less prone to over confidence, women are more ambitious, women are more likely to take a long-term view, and women succeed despite facing more barriers than their male counterparts”. Business Barriers The Forbes article reports women succeed in the face of multiple barriers. Earlier this year they stated women generally start businesses with significantly less capital than men. On average women’s starting capital is around $75,000 USD compared to men at $135,000 USD. Forbes also reports women do not think they have the networks in place to support their business growth. Women entrepreneurs and small business owners make up 30-35% on the entrepreneurial community globally. While there are dedicated networks for women small business owners, founders, and investors the fact of the matter is the community is very small and spread out over vast areas. In the same article, Forbes reports women think they lack the technical expertise to successfully run and grow their businesses. In large part this is related to the gender imbalance in the STEM fields and in the traditional business sectors, like finance and accounting. These perceived lacks force women to work harder for success. How do we push past these barriers? It is in the list above. Taking calculated risks, not being over-confident, and being very ambitious. Additionally, women have long term goals and strategies in mind. Forbes reports, “the research suggests women are more likely to reinvest business profit in order to generate steady and profitable growth, while men are more likely to look for faster growth, possibly fuelled by equity investment, and a quicker exit”. Positive Impact These personality traits paired steady, long-term growth strategies means “female entrepreneurs in the Centre for Entrepreneurship study take home twice as much pay as the men,” according to Forbes. Our advice, there are several successful women in the Impact Hub Vienna community. Here is a quick list we published last year. Spend International Women’s day asking a successful woman for business advice. Or read a book from this helpful list we published written by and about successful women business owners.","March 8, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cover-winedown-closing-the-gender-gap-600x400.jpg"
"180","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/03/13/business-basics-pitching-to-investors/","ImpactHub","Business Basics: Pitching to Investors","So, you want to start your own business but need a hand from someone who already has experience. Someone who can financially back your company and mentor you? Pitching to investors maybe the key to your success. Having a well prepared, organized, and short pitch deck is important to attract investors. An investor’s time is valuable which means five minutes or less is an ideal pitch length. The main goal is to let them know what your business is about, why it is important, the target market, and why they should invest. However, just the numbers can disengage an investor. You have to engage them and tell them stories. Intrigue them. Make them love your company and your idea. Five minutes doesn’t seem like it would be enough time to do everything. It doesn’t even seem like enough time to get the basics out. We assure you it is possible. The key is to be precise, concise and go straight to the point. They don´t need to know everything. There really is only one thing an investor needs to know, why they should invest in you and your idea. We put together some basics to help you create a pitch to investors Introduce yourself and your business Let them know what your business is about. What is your industry? If they are already familiar with it, then make it quick and provide necessary information only. Word choice is important. Be concise and clear. Sometimes, simpler words are better to express your idea. E.G. Use the word “use” instead of “utilize”. They actually mean different things and “utilize” does not make you sound better informed. Tell them an exciting story about your startup, everyone loves to hear stories! Inspire them! E.G. Tell them your origin story. Stories are exciting and inspiring. How did you become Bill Gates to the organic food movement? Tell them who you are and why you are in this business. At the beginning, you will not have data that applies specifically to your business or product. You haven’t started yet. You will have general market data, possibly statistics on comparable products. Investors understand, “At this point, they’re investing in you and your team,” explains Sheeva Sairafi, the founder and CEO of “Local and Lejos” said in an interview with Ivanka Trump’s blog. Show them that you and your team have the necessary skills, experience and passion to execute your startup. “Angel investors invest first in the entrepreneur not in the business plan. It’s important that the investor and entrepreneur can get along. They will want to see that you are fast, thoughtful and efficient, and can sustain the project through its conception and growth” says Baybars Altuntas in an interview with Forbes magazine, a successful entrepreneur and Ambassador of the World Entrepreneurship Forum, a global think tank dedicated to entrepreneurship. Know your product/service This is one of the most important points. At the end of the day, you want investors to provide you financial support because your idea is good. Let them know what problem your target customers are facing and how your business will solve it. They need to know why you offer a better solution than those already on the market. Give them a balanced account; let them know the pros and cons. Prove why your idea deserves funding. In order to do this well, you need to know your market well. This means knowing your customers and competitors. It might be a good idea to put together a “buyer persona”. This is a communications and marketing tool to help you better communicate with your target audience. By creating one for your pitch deck it can help you deepen your market knowledge. Make a business canvas There are many good reasons to create a business canvas. It keeps you on track and it helps set goals. In this context, it shows investors you are capable. Some key points to include in your pitch: Check out how to create a nice Canvas Model https://canvanizer.com. Creating visually appealing and informative documents show that you are prepared and informed. Give your prospective investor a copy at the end of the meeting. They can read the details later and have a reference for decision-making. Escape Clause Investors need to know what will happen if your venture doesn’t work out. Or what will happen if your venture is wildly successful. The first one is obvious, they want to protect their investment. However, the second businesses have failed before with rapid expansion and no way to handle unexpected growth. Be Prepared Think about questions may arise and have answers prepared. Practice A LOT. Not just the answers to questions but your entire presentation. Practice until you feel natural delivering it in your sleep. Remember that first impressions are powerful, prepare yourself for show-time! When Christine Chang and Sarah Lee pitched their Korean beauty company, “Glow Recipe”, on Shark Tank, they found that the key to success was practice. “We were confident that we knew the ins and outs of our business better than anyone, but it came down to succinct and compelling delivery,” says Christine in an interview with Ivanka Trump’s blog.

Their goal is to create sustainable solutions for food supply. All their products can be purchased online directly from producers. Customers receive additional insights to the high-quality regional products they buy which promotes awareness of the true diversity of food. Pflanzen-Urinal The “Plant-Urinal” is a urinal for men and women with an integrated vertical plant-based treatment system. Treated and purified wastewater can then be reused in the toilet. This project is being developed by alchemia-nova GmbH in collaboration with Blue Carex Phytotechnologies. In addition to wastewater treatment, the vertical plant wall offers all the advantages of a green wall such as microclimate improvement, reduction of air particulates and pollution, and a nature-based aesthetic. The goal of the project is to develop a functional nature-based solution for city dwellers while increasing the biodiversity in heavily developed areas. SEEDPAP – Die blühende Verpackung The idea of SEEDPAP is to produce packaging that blooms. Packaging is made of waste paper filled with insect-friendly seeds. It is suitable for gifts, paper bags, egg cartons, and for filling packages. When the packaging has served its purpose, it can be covered with a little soil and if kept moist, it will sprout! SEEDPAP’s goal is to raise awareness of the importance of insect pollination in food production. Their packaging can be used not only in large gardens, but also in flower pots, small front gardens, and fallow areas.","March 20, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nature-600x400.jpg"

We wanted to feature some inspiring books written by women to keep inspiring all the female founders and everyone else in our community. This year we focused on the question of leadership. C-suites and corporate boards still have few women. We cannot solve the problem in one day, however, we can inspire our community to act by reading these books. We put together this list of the best books for leading ladies and female founders. We have listed five books we know everyone should read to create more inclusive workforces and confident women leaders. We know you can’t focus on work over the holidays which is why we included some fantastic fiction reads for passive inspiration. Leading the Way Through the Labyrinth: The Truth About How Women Become Leaders Authors Eagli and Carli explore the myriad of issues affecting women becoming leaders today. The main concept of the book is the glass ceiling is no longer a proper metaphor for women attaining leadership roles. They admit women have made real progress in this arena, however, there is still a long way to go. All the way through the labyrinth. The maze created by prejudice, organizational behaviour, traditional gender roles, and everything else under the sun. While this book focuses on women in leadership roles, it does highlight the stark exclusion of men from every day family life. Grounded in vast research with personal stories to illustrate the overall argument, the book is an academic tour de force. A Good Time to be a Girl Helena Morrissey is at the forefront of the campaign for gender balance in the UK. Morrissey makes the case for diversity in the workforce and a more inclusive society as the only way to move forward. Achieving gender balance in the workforce, is for Morrissey, a driver of economic success of societies and individuals. While the book and author do court some controversial views, the message is clear, we need everyone to move forward. The Confidence Effect: Every Woman’s Guide to the Attitude the Attracts Success Grace Killelea astutely asks “women are told to step up and lean in, but how?” For Killelea it is not just about a patriarchal work culture. “Men are prone to overestimate their abilities, while women too often sell themselves short,” and Killilea questions women’s overall confidence in striking out and achieving their goals. In this essential guide book, she lays down simple strategies for women to bolster their confidence and increase their influence by practicing “the Four Rs of Success-relationships, reputation, results, and resilience-dipping.” This book is essential inspiration for anyone. Earning It: Hard-Won Lessons from Trailblazing Women at the Top of the Business World Finance is a man’s world and reporting on financial matters is the same. Joann S. Lublin was among the first women reporters at the Wall Street Journal. She rose through the ranks to lead a bureau office in London. She chronicles her success, along with fifty other successful women at the top of their game. Lublin is an experienced journalist peppering the lessons in success these great ladies learned along the way with concrete strategies and personal anecdotes. Lublin focuses on the specific dilemmas women experience in the work world. However, she never forgets women have other identities outside of their working lives, meaning lover, sister, friend, mother are all meaningful roles and deserve time and effort. A Better Tomorrow We Should All be Feminists Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes everything; fiction, non-fiction, short stories, and some philosophy. Really, anything by her is amazing and worth reading repeatedly. What else would you expect from someone who won the MacArthur Genius Grant. The book is short and simple. Its message very clear: we must all change to be equal. If you don’t have time to read the book, Adichie gave a powerful TedTalk to summarize the book. Passive Inspiration The Power Naomi Alderman won the Bailey’s Prize for Women’s Fiction last year for this novella. The world is recognizable, it is our own for the most part. Well, there is one tiny twist. Teenage girls suddenly discover they have the power to cause indescribable physical pain, even death. This is speculative fiction at its best, forcing readers to see our current world through new perspectives. Moon Girl and the Devil Dinosaur Who is Marvel’s smartest superhero? Tony Stark is likely what you answered, however, you are wrong. It is Lunella Lafayette, she is nine years old, sports a backpack, and her side kick is a giant red dinosaur. The comic tackles gender issues, social inclusivity, and race issues all through the eyes of a child. The art is beautiful and the stories are action packed. They are also perfect for any clever girls in your life which you wish to see grow up into confident women. Need more inspiration?

"183","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/01/spotlight-interview-xxx-reji/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: An interview with Alexey Chernikov about Reji, a language learning app."," Reji is a subscription based iPhone/iPad app that helps you learn new vocabulary with correct pronunciation using customizable flashcards. It is the third app from Twopeople Software, a nascent startup specializing in language learning. Alexey sat down with us to talk about what’s special about Reji, why he and his team decided to develop it, and what they have planned for the coming year. How did it all start? What made you decide to develop Reji? Reji started as a result of one of our other apps called Mate Translate, a translation app. It has this feature called Phrasebook where you can create custom word lists. Reji is a spin-off of this with additional features added for language learning. We decided to do this because from a marketing perspective, it’s difficult to position a product that’s a translator and a language learning application at the same time. Putting them in two separate apps is simpler and easier for everyone. What makes Reji stand out from other language learning or flashcard apps? What’s the value proposition? Concerning language learning apps, I don’t think there’s anything like Reji on the market. Most other language learning apps like Duolingo or Memrise are focused on teaching you basic grammar and vocabulary with no ability to customize anything. The app has a lesson plan for you and you do it. We are targeting advanced language learners whose skill level has grown beyond these apps. Their main need is to brush up on or expand their vocabulary. If we’re talking about flashcard apps, there are other apps on the market like Anki, but it’s incredibly time-intensive to make your own flashcards–you basically have to fill everything out by yourself. With Reji, all you need to do is type the word that you want to learn and the app will do the rest. It’ll populate the images, GIFs, phonetics, transliterations, and definitions associated with the word giving the user more time to learn. With other apps, it can take almost a day to make 100 flashcards. With Reji, it’ll take around 10 minutes. Why is what you’re offering important for today? I think with globalization and migration, it’s very important that we learn each other’s languages. I want to offer people the ability to do that in the best and most effective way. I also think that technologies that can help you learn something or improve yourself are important and if I can provide this solution, you’ll be better and as a result, the world will be better. What made you focus your efforts on language learning? I’ve always had an interest in languages. I’ve been learning English since a very young age. I’ve also learned German over the years and started to learn some Czech and French. It’s my area of expertise given my personal and professional interests. I’m all about languages. What milestones would you like to hit in the next year? One important milestone is to hit 10,000 paying users by the end of this year. Another one is to offer the App on Android. These two markets are different and we’ve focused on Apple because that’s the market we know but we’re well aware of the opportunity with Android. Our current iOS market is around 60,000,000 people. If you add Android to that, it becomes 700,000,000 because of developing countries like India, Vietnam, and Brazil. Have their been any setbacks or challenges to launching Reji? We are self-funding everything ourselves so we’re always dealing with a lack of resources. The reason why we’re launching only on iOS is because we lack the resources to launch on iOS and Android at the same time. This also affects our marketing spend which would typically be Facebook ads and other things like that. But these constraints force us to get creative with our marketing efforts so we’re focusing more on growth hacking solutions to spread our message. How many people are on your team? There’s 4 of us right now. 3 full-time and one-part time. We’re all working remotely but the hope is that after the launch of Reji, we can get the money to have everyone in the same place. While working remotely has worked and does work, it’ll be nice to not have any time lag or slack lag in conversations. How hard is it to program an app like Reji? How long did it take to develop the app? Nowadays, I think with online courses, you can get the basics of App development without having to be a mathematician, a scientist, or a technician. Reji wasn’t that hard to code because we’re not using anything complicated like A.I. or deep learning. It’s mostly a user interface with some interaction with servers. It’s not easy but it takes time. To get the test version up and running, it took us about two months but I should mention that we were working off the code base that we had for Mate Translate. I would say, if you started Reji from scratch, it would take a full-time developer about 5 months. It’s a lot of work. What impact would you like to see Reji have? I really want people to be able to learn words more effectively and to be inspired to learn more languages at the same time. If Reji can achieve that then I’m happy. What’s next for you and your team? We want to figure out what’s the best business model for Reji. Right now, we’re working off of the assumption that a subscription business model will work. Over the next few months, we’re going to test that theory and find out what works best for us. We’re also looking into some startup accelerators. I feel that we lack some experience in growing products globally. We already handle 500,000 monthly users. We want to be able to handle 50,000,000. Reji is now available in the Apple App Store.

"184","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/09/the-fierce-female-founders-of-impact-hub-vienna/","ImpactHub","The Fierce Female Founders of Impact Hub Vienna","In March, we focused on Social Development Goal #5, Gender Equality, and discussed how female entrepreneurs are making significant strides toward balancing out the number of businesses founded by women versus men in Austria and across the globe. While there is still a long way to go, our recent WineDown on Closing the Gender Gap inspired us by convening en masse a group of active and aspiring female entrepreneurs to learn from founders who are currently starting and scaling their own businesses. To keep the sharing and connection going, we wanted to capture insights from a few more women entrepreneurs in our community to share their unique perspectives as founders and business owners. We asked each of these ladies why it’s important for women to startup and what insights they have to share about entrepreneurship. Here is what they had to say: Lisa-Maria Sommer, More Than One Perspective “The majority of founders are still male. I think, it is important women also start founding their own businesses and realize their brilliant ideas. In this way, young companies will be shaped by women and profit from their vision, working styles and energy.” MORE THAN ONE PERSPECTIVE, a social business based in Vienna working on the labor market integration of highly skilled refugees. She founded MTOP with Julian Richter and Nina Poxleitner who she met while working at Teach for Austria where they came face to face the consequences of a poorly conceived integration program. Cornelia Mayer, Topfreisen “Founding your own business gives you freedom – you don’t need to ask anyone to make a decision and you can shape the relationship with your co-workers and customers the way you want. Everyone has to do what is in his or her power to shape the world in a fruitful way – founding your own business is a beautiful way to do that.” Cornelia Mayer is the founder of Topfreisen, a catering service with refugees cooking food from their home countries. After traveling for six months, Cornelia was seeking new challenges in her career and wanted to take on new projects outside her role as a social worker. With the founding of her catering business, which also recently launched a bistro, she found the perfect extension for her professional background and new learning experiences. Perrine Schober, Shades Tours “It is important for everyone to strive to do what they really want – if they have the luxury of being able to choose. I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone to have a business, as it is hard work, re-shifts all priorities you have in life. To have an additional role – the one of a business owner – is an addition to all different roles that you have in life, such as: mother, daughter, friend, lover, sister, aunt. However, once the hard work is done, once the business is growing and standing on its own feet, once it is viable even without you, then gratitude sets in. The gratitude to have been able to have invented the most suitable job for yourself. How many people can say that?!” Perrine Schober is the founder of SHADES TOURS in Vienna. She studied tourism management in Germany and specialised in the topic “Tourism As Macroeconomic Tool for Poverty Alleviation”. Schober worked for several international development aid agencies in Vietnam, Eastern Turkey, Belize and the Philippines until she decided to start her own social business in April 2015. SHADES TOURS offers socio-political tours on the topic of poverty and homelessness in Vienna, given by homeless people with experience in the Austrian social systems. Andrea Lunzer, Lunzers Maß-Greißlerei “Running your own business is the most self-empowering thing a woman can do. To make your vision come true and decide what, where, and with whom you want to work with is very rewarding. It is important to set an example for younger women so they can grow up in a world where female leaders are common. Andrea Lunzer is the founder of Lunzers Maß-Greißlerei in Vienna. The zero-waste store is the culmination of her long standing struggle to reduce packaging waste. Several stops in the packaging and food industry led Andrea to create a radical alternative to normal grocery shopping and go zero. Since opening its doors, Lunzers has become much more than just a grocery store it’s the place to discuss zero waste lifestyle, locally sourced food, and DIY cosmetics–to name a few things–and is expanding its activities in hosting a passionate zero-waste community. Karin Kuranda & Jessica Neumann, Endlos Fesch “We believe that women are great leaders and of course they bring so much expertise on many different levels. Unfortunately, women are underrepresented and undermined in many areas, specifically as CEOs. Therefore, it is important to encourage more women to steer companies and create their own businesses, where they can act independently and highlight their strengths.” Karin Kuranda (right) and Jessica Neumann (left) are the founders of Endlos Fesch – the Vienna Fashion Library. Members can rent high-quality women’s fashion, including pieces from local designers, e.g. MaMaMu, Tutu Vienna, and die Rote Zora. The library currently offers about three hundred pieces. The options are a mix of fair fashion, sustainably produced clothing, ex-favorite pieces from community members, and vintage dresses. As part of the zero waste Austria initiative, Karin and Jessica believe in social and ecological change for a greater impact. The founders actively apply existing sustainable and green solutions that focus on using zero waste technologies.

"185","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/10/tech-for-good-the-basics/","ImpactHub","Tech For Good: The Basics","In the nineties, the pervasive attitude towards playing videogames was like the way in which people viewed television. They would rot children’s brains. They would make children act out violent fantasies. My sister’s orthopedic surgeon suggested to my parents playing videogames might help my sister develop hand eye coordination skills and dexterity. We received a Super Nintendo the following Christmas. Recently, research has suggested immersive story telling games, like the upcoming Detroit: Become Human, help players develop skills in reading emotions and empathy, like reading fiction. While videogames still have a bad reputation, it would seem they are doing some good in the world by helping children with cognitive and physical disabilities gain necessary skills and helping the world be just a bit more empathetic. The technology cannot be all bad, right? However, can technology be good? Many people support the idea of Tech For Good, including the biggest technology companies but what does it actually mean. Ethics and Technology Technology, in and of itself, is neutral. It is neither “good” or “bad” by any philosophical definition. However, it is how we choose to use technology which confers the moral status. The above paragraph is incredibly philosophical. However, the concept requires definition and sometimes it is best to start off at the highest level and work backwards to a workable and practicable definition, with examples. The British website Tech for Good has the best and most grounded definition, “At its heart, it’s all about people. People using the power of tech in myriad ways, both simple and extraordinary.” They provide some high-level examples as their definition continues, “to help redistribute power, give agency to people, help people make more informed decisions, create ways for people to connect, participate, address health or care needs and save energy.” This broad definition begs the question of what this looks like. In the real world … The future is now, at least in the case of super markets. Carlo Ratti Associati have worked with Coop, in Italy, to develop the super market of the future. Reflective screens give shoppers information on the origin and methods used to grow their produce, including “the details of its journey to the market,” the Business Insider reported in a January 2017 article. Carlo Ratti Associati hope the market will promote more informed consumption habits. The shelves in the market are lower, intentionally. “The idea is that, since customers can see into the next aisle, they might strike up a conversation with a stranger,” the Business Insider reports. The design firm is hoping people will develop new social links in this manner. aWATTar is a Vienna based agency which provides consumers with information about when the highest levels of renewable energy are in the power grid. They are hoping through providing consumers with accurate information we can shift the demand and create a greater dependence on renewable energy sources. Fitness trackers are on the rise. They help us all make healthier choices in our day to day lives about walking and calorie consumption. They are good for us and the environment by decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels and increasing our dependence on our own two feet. The Fitbit and Apple Watch can provide accurate, long term information about heart rates to physicians. There are reports all over the media about how the stored historical data allowed physicians to make a more informed treatment decision, identifying life threatening irregular patterns, and even using the technology in arrhythmia studies. It also gives patients greater agency in their own care by providing them with useful and timely information. It is amazing what a little information can do to improve our daily lives and our future.

However, before you can deliver ground breaking technologies which provide tracking on world poverty eradication, design new braille technologies and fonts, or tackle the human machine design interface you need inspiration and to get the basics right. With those thoughts in mind we turned our bookshelves to find the best books for tech entrepreneurs. As per usual, we threw in a couple of fiction books and a comic book for weekend reading. We hope these will inspire you to innovate and create something new. On the Shelves Conscious Capitalism This book by John Mackey, Co-founder Whole Foods Market, and Raj Sisodia present the argument that capitalism can be good. Not just good but is inherently good. The authors argue capitalism can work for management, stakeholders, employees, and society at large. While the opinion is certainly controversial, they profile many successful companies across an array of fields to illustrate their argument. They present an instruction manual for any company looking to evolve ethically. Start Up Land: How Three Guys Risked Everything to Turn an Idea into a Global Business Written by Mikkel Svane, the founder the CEO of Zendesk, the book chronicles the founding of the business and the friendships which survived the whole ordeal. This book is part memoir and part guide. Svane is speaking to other entrepreneurs from the perspective of someone still running the business, still making difficult daily decisions, and still working on the original exciting idea. This book is useful for anyone looking to scale up or even thinking of jumping into the deep end. The Second Machine Age: Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explore our love affair with continual invention and innovation of technology. And while they celebrate our progress chronicling the development of self-driving cars and Watson the Robot, they also explore the question on everyone’s minds: what happens when the machine takes over my job. The authors provide a blueprint for prosperity in the face of adversity, making radical recommendations like changing the education system. Optimistic and well-researched the book is essential to anyone looking to successfully navigate in the coming machine age. Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley This book is filled with insights from former Twitter Advisor and Facebook Product Manager, Antonio Garcia Martinez. The eponymous chaos monkeys he refers to in the book at Uber, Tinder, Netflix, and many other disruptive tech companies which changed how we live our lives. And while he does chronicle the rise of these disruptors, he also has a few tales about his own adventures being a “Silicon Velley wastrel,” which is a term not often used any longer. The book is a subversive and irreverent look inside the tech bubble. Sometimes going forward means looking back Sometimes the best way to move forward and harness the power of technology is to realize we do not need it. And so, we have a recommendation for a book on the opposite of technological progress and innovation. The Revenge of Analog Written by Canadian journalist David Sax this book is a loving portrait of how we are resurrecting what used to be. Sometimes the latest and greatest thing is something already invented and the hot new thing on the market has always existed. From a vinyl pressing company to notebooks, from successful paper-based magazines to crowd-funded bookstores, he explores worlds we had thought long gone but were merely hibernating. The book hit the best seller lists world-wide, and even features the Viennese photography movement, Lomography, which is taking the world by storm. Metropole reviewed the book last year, check out the full article. Because no one wants to work on a summer weekend Don’t worry, we have you covered. It is beautiful outside. The weather is warm. The sun is shining. Pack yourself a picnic and a blanket and head to the park for a Saturday afternoon. While away the hours soaking up all the lovely sunshine by reading some fiction. The Martian Andy Weir transports us to the red surface of Mars and the tragedy that befalls the main character, Mark Watney, when he is abandonned during a raging storm on the planet’s surface. He uses the technology available to survive. Everything from hydroponically growing plants to eat to eventually communicating with Earth. The book is packed with realistic technology and is an exciting read. Mr. Terrific Self-made millionaire and owner of a tech company Mr. Terrific is truly a super hero for the entrepreneur. The current Mr. Terrific is Michael Holt. His back story is one of devastating loss and loneliness. He starts youth centers, works towards greater social inclusion, and fights super villains.

This month, we’re celebrating those who lean towards the latter. We want to shine a light on the people you walk past every day who are using technology in a positive way to change how we think, how we care, and how we read. Here is the lineup of teams that will join us at this month’s WineDown. World Data Lab The World Data Lab is a predictive and analytical NGO specializing in developing granular economic and demographic forecasts for every country at any point in time. Their products harness the power of social, econometric, and geospatial data modeling to help decision-makers in the public, private and international development sectors. Their most popular product, the World Poverty Clock, is a webtool that forecasts poverty rates in every country of the world from today through 2030. The goal is to monitor the progress of UN SDG Goal #1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere in real-time. Humanizing Technologies Humanizing Technologies are experts in robotics. They advise, sell, and develop applications for robots. You’ve probably seen them around the city with their robot Pepper. They offer retailers the possibility to seamlessly create, manage, and deploy content to multiple robots with one click–you can welcome, assist, provide recommendations, entertain your customers, and even give hugs to people. Humanizing Technologies’ main goal is to bring humans and technology together. One of their current projects is to explore how Pepper can help in caregiving for people suffering from dementia. Tetragon Tetragon is the inventor of the Braillering. It is a refreshable and mobile braille display for the visually impaired. Braille displays have been around since the 70’s but little has changed since. They are often large, limited in capability, and prohibitively expensive. If they are small, they are even more limited in capability, and even more prohibitively expensive. The Braillering will change all that. Costing little more than a smartphone, blind people will finally have the mobile braille reading solution they’ve been dreaming of. Impact Go Impact Go is going to be the next generation of giving. Their goal is to provide mothers and children in Africa with medical services. Donors will know exactly where their money is going and how they’ve created impact. Impact Go is the first Austrian start-up which cooperates with African start-ups. refugees{code} refugees{code} is an Austrian not-for-profit coding school for refugees whose goal is to integrate refugees into the job market. Participants develop coding and software development skills through an intensive 9-month training program that finishes with a job placement. Vienna Data Science Group The Vienna Data Science Group (VDSG) is a nonprofit association promoting knowledge about data science. Their goal is to establish a platform for knowledge exchange between data professionals from research and industry, data enthusiasts, and other interested parties enabling giving everyone the ability to seize opportunities and understand the risks lying ahead. Don’t be afraid of tech. Embrace it like these ventures. Make the choice to use it for good. If you do, the possibilities are endless.

"188","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/17/5-tech4good-movies-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","5 Tech For Good Movies for Entrepreneurs"," Technology got us to where we are today and movies are a technology that not only pushes against the limits of technology itself, but continues to inform us about the technology we dream of and the techonology we fear. Since the beginning of cinema, movies have shown us depictions of technology. From the classic Metropolis, to Sleeper, to Blade Runner, the technology depicted inspires as much fear as it does awe. Here’s our list of 5 Tech For Good movies we think are worth watching: Minority Report One of the highlights of Spielberg’s career, Minority Report follows Tom Cruise as he gets into all sorts of trouble in the PreCrime Division of Washington, D.C. of 2054. If you’re not engrossed by the neo-noir storyline and the philosophical issues, there are autonomous cars, insect robots, multi-touch interfaces, and retina scanners to keep you entertained. This all might seem a bit dated since all this technology exists now (except the insect robots), but remember this was 2002. Marvel at how much they got right. And keep an eye out for the crown jewel of all technological achievements: jetpacks. Short Circuit Sometimes, dangerous military technology just needs to be struck by lightning. This is the plot of Short Circuit, an 80’s classic with none other than Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, and Number 5! The robot becomes sentient, learns about the world, and tries to prevent his deactivation by his creators. With the topic of killer robots occupying the headlines of today, take some time to watch a movie where you will see how non-killer robots are just way more fun. 2001: A Space Odyssey If you haven’t seen it already, you’re just in time for the 50th anniversary of this Stanley Kubrick’s classic. A pinnacle of sci-fi cinema and easily the most influential and referenced, it not only set the bar of what film could achieve at that time, but it also showed us what technology has brought us, what it means to us, and most importantly, its limitations: “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Her A touching love story from the great Spike Jonze starring a wonderfully forlorn Joaquin Phoenix about what happens when we give life to technology. Theodore Twombly is a lonely and depressed man who enters into a relationship with an OS (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who can adapt and learn. If you want to be reductive, it’s a movie about a relationship with a computer. But, if you give it a chance, it’s so much more than that. We always have this idea that technology is inhuman but if it’s created by us, how could it be anything but human? Jurassic Park A movie that needs no introduction now that we’re almost five movies in. But this is the original and yet another Spielberg classic. Try not to focus on what happens when the dinosaurs break out and start killing people. Focus on the fact that there are dinosaurs again! How cool would that be? It made me believe, and it still does.

Their predictive data can help NGOs and Governments better forecast demographic trends to plan more effective projects. Fueled by WDL’s mission and maybe a cup of coffee or two, Sara took the time to sit down and talk about the beginnings of the WDL, the challenges they’ve faced along the way, and how they want to help solve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). How did the WDL come together? The World Data Lab was founded by Wolfgang Fengler, Lead Economist at The World Bank, and Homi Kharas, the Interim Vice-President and Director of Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution. They were former colleagues at The World Bank who wanted to expand beyond the boundaries of large institutions and do something new with data. They wanted to predict and measure data better than its ever been done before. What are the goals of the WDL? One of our missions is to apply data to help measure and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Unfortunately, international development organizations and governments are often a step behind. They have old data, or it’s past-looking data, or the numbers aren’t updated regularly. We want to use forward-looking data to create a new approach and bring problem-solving into the 21st century for the developing world. We also support the private sector in finding new and emerging markets. What is the value proposition of the WDL? Our value proposition is the democratization of data. We want to make sure that everyone has access to the power of Big Data, and to make it meaningful to non-data people who might be overwhelmed by the vastness of data out there. What are some of your current projects? Currently, we are working on merging our income and demographic data to create a new data set that no one’s created before. We want to give organizations the ability to see income distribution by age for every country. For example, how many men or women in Guangzhou, China will make 50 to 75 dollars a day in the year 2025? That is something that doesn’t exist and we’re working really hard to make that happen. We have incorporated this and other data forecasts into our private sector webtool, the Market Pro. This tool allows private sector companies to explore future emerging markets and calculate future market size. We are also working on a project that will provide income and age estimates from space using earth observation (i.e. satellite) imagery. We, along with our Austrian partner GeoVille, got a grant from the European Space Agency to do this project. We combine our econometric and demographic data modeling techniques with earth observation photos to create a more robust data set. We have other geospatial data modeling projects where we use this methodology to provide income and age estimates for North Korea which is a place where nobody has any solid data. What impact would you like to see the WDL have? We would like to empower institutions with cutting edge tools to solve SDG issues. Because we’re smaller and faster, we can develop these tools quickly without the bureaucratic red tape and put them in the hands of those who can make the most out of them. What are the some of the challenges you’ve faced to get to where you are now? We’re a small team that wants to make a big impact and we have an ambitious goal. One challenge was proving ourselves alongside the giant institutions with larger resources such as The Economist but we’ve managed to do that. Sustaining funding, as with any young organization, is also a challenge. Our solution has been to develop products for the private sector which will help us fund our public sector projects and keep us afloat. We do receive public sector grants, but they are often given out piecemeal which sometimes doesn’t align with a rapidly developing organization. What are some of the milestones you want to hit over the next year? We would like to begin development on the World Water Clock (SDG-6), the World Hunger Clock (SDG-2), and the World Education Clock (SDG-4). We are in the early stages of developing partnerships with large international organizations to tackle these projects, so this takes some time. We currently have 4 global hubs responsible for subnational data collection as well as modeling: Kenya, Pakistan, and Indonesia. We’ve just on-boarded Brazil, and later this year we hope to have Mexico, Rwanda, Uganda, and Iran secured. How can members of Impact Hub help? We need some more connections to private sector companies who could use our products. If anyone knows someone who needs income or demographic forecasts, please send them our way! Our products are designed to help marketers find and develop new markets on a very granular level. This is really important because building out our private sector client base will give us more breathing room and more time to do the research we need to do to create the tools that can help the world.

"190","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/04/25/communication-skills-startups/","ImpactHub","Communication Skills for Startups","Communication Skills for Startups Startups have a lot on their plate. Startup to-do lists are burdened with business plans, accounting, paperwork, marketing, tech issues, financial issues, and more, often on a limited budget and with limited staff. It’s hard to know what to prioritize when there’s so much to do. With all this to worry about, one mistake many entrepreneurs make is to leave communication plans by the wayside. Gregor Schütze, founder of Schütze, a positioning and public performance agency in Vienna, visited our first Skillshare breakfast of 2018 to discuss top communication skills for startups. Let’s take a look at some of the ways entrepreneurs should start setting up their communication plans. Define your target audience Before you even start actually communicating, you should define your target audience. Gregor asserts that you should have more than one target audience, and each form of communication should be tailored to that audience. For example, you are going to communicate differently with your investors than your employees, and you’ll even want to focus your message a little differently to your existing customers compared to with your potential customers. When you’re coming up with a message, make sure you decide which audience you’re “speaking with” before you start. Entrepreneurs often forget about communication with their employees, but, according to Gregor, it should also be considered a specific field of communication. It will be valuable in the long-run, and it’s unique from any other kind of communication (and is essential to treat it as such). Decide which media to use The type of media channels you go through is just as important as the message itself. You can write the perfect message for your target audience, but if you’re publishing it in a space that no one in that group reads, it won’t have any effect. You should first decide whether you want to go through classical media (basically anything written by reporters) or new media (social media, online advertising, etc.). While things are certainly moving more towards new media, classical media nonetheless remains relevant for specific audiences. When deciding on media to use, you should not only keep your target audience in mind but also your credibility. Gregor mentioned that research found that local newspapers have the highest credibility, but it still only makes sense to go through local newspapers for specific types of audiences. Form a crisis communication plan (before a crisis occurs) Having a crisis communication plan is more important than you might think. No matter how big or small a company is, lacking a crisis communication plan could be the beginning of the end if the worst happens. Having a crisis and dealing with it well can actually increase the credibility of your brand rather than ruining it, as long as you’re prepared in advance. As outlined by Gregor, there are three aspects to having an effective communication plan: PreparationTake the time to sit down and think about what the worst thing that could possibly happen to your business is. Plan every single aspect of how you would deal with that crisis occurring. Decide who would do what tasks (i.e. who would talk to the media, who would deal with investors, and so on). Ideally, this will never be necessary, but it will help everyone know exactly what they should be doing if the worst does happen to you. SpeedThere is no time to spare during a crisis. You don’t get to take the weekend to think about it, because people will continue reacting during that time. There is no time to sit down and set up a plan; not responding for a while in the time of a crisis makes a company look disorganized at best, immoral at worst. CredibilityWhen discussing the crisis with the press, don’t say things that you think sound good. Say things that are true. Whatever you do, don’t lie about something — it could destroy your company’s credibility. Feel free to keep certain details to yourself, but whatever is said should be the truth. Measure your communication activities Some of these forms of media cost money (and at the very least, they cost time), so knowing how to use your communication efficiently will help you in the long run. As Gregor pointed out, paying 1 Euro for Google Ads is probably better spent than spending 1 Euro for an hour of PR — but then again, it also depends on your message and audience. Every startup is short on funds, so being efficient with your spending is crucial. This is where measuring comes in handy. Whatever communication you can measure, you should. See if you can use a tracking code on any posts you have on other websites to see what the traffic looks like. Get acquainted with Google Analytics (a free resource) to start tracking conversion rates. You can even track the results of communicating via classical media. If you want to try out a few new newspapers, publish in them one at a time. That way, you can better pinpoint which one actually led to the best results. In the end, it’s all about saving you time and money while achieving success. ","April 25, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/communication-600x400.jpg"
"191","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/03/may-migration-inclusion/","ImpactHub","Understanding Migration and Inclusion","Many of us remember the busy train stations of Vienna when thousands of refugees were arriving or passing through in 2015. It was a chaotic scene, but dozens of volunteers and several organizations stepped up to help them pass through or arrive, giving them supplies and providing them show that these migrants were welcome here. Many trains pulling into the station were greeted with applause. But of course, the journey of migration doesn’t stop upon arrival. It’s been nearly three years since that initial “refugee crisis” of 2015, and press, as well as public interest, have seemed to fizzle out in recent years. What hasn’t fizzled out, however, is the predicament that recent arrivals have found themselves in. How does one start a new life in a brand new, unfamiliar country? Getting acclimated to their new city and country is a huge piece of the puzzle, and often it’s a very difficult one. Sometimes it takes years to really find your place in a foreign environment, whether you’re a Western expat or a refugee from a war-torn country. This doesn’t even take into account the difficulty that language, skin color, and religion present in a society that can sometimes be hostile towards these differences. Luckily, people are aware of this, and initiatives have been started to help jump-start the lives of many arrivals. Some are designed to help refugees find a place to stay. Others are designed to help with educational aspects of their lives. Once their basic needs are met, refugees can start to become self-reliant and engaged in Austrian society by joining the labor force. It isn’t easy to get your foot in the door when you’re a new arrival, but it can make a world of difference in the lives of the workers as well as the city and country’s society as a whole. Impact Hub Vienna, in cooperation with Deloitte Future Fund Austria, has taken steps to recognize some of those ventures that are helping refugees access the labor market via the found! accelerator program. Whether it’s mentoring programs, job creation, or breaking down stereotypes, the ventures supported by found! offer a glimmer of hope for the future. And, better yet, this is just what we’re recognizing. There’s even more out there, and more in the works. Let’s take the month of May to focus on migration, the problems migrants are facing in Vienna and elsewhere, and some of our ventures’ solutions to those problems. After all, if refugees succeed, we all succeed. Photo Credit: Lea Fabienne ","May 3, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/inclusive--600x400.jpg"
"192","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/04/spotlight-interview-myounghee-jo-alexander-bachinger-bubbles-kraut/","ImpactHub","Spotlight: An interview with Bubbles & Kraut"," Longtime Impact Hub members Myounghee Jo and Alexander Bachinger have just launched Bubbles & Kraut, a social venture addressing the food waste problem through fermentation. They offer workshops and sell their very own fermented products such as kimchi and kombucha and hope to build a community focused on food sustainability and preservation. With their first workshop just around the corner, Jo and Alex sat down to talk about the very beginnings of their venture, the plans they have for the future, and the ongoing mystery of who is Bubbles and who is Kraut. What made you two start Bubbles & Kraut? Alex: We both had certain ideas of what we wanted to do. Jo wanted to do something with food, community building, and cooking workshops. She wanted to bring out the social and communal aspects of cooking. I always wanted to do something with fermentation and sell fermented products, especially kimchi because it’s one of my favorite things in the world. Jo: Since I’m from Korea, kimchi is my soul food and that’s where we connected and found our common ground. After I met Alex, it was clear to both of us that kimchi could form the foundation of workshops and that we could sell it so it was a natural synergy of our passions that allows us to fulfill our independent ambitions together. How did you come up with the name? Were there other names that you considered? Jo: We had a fun brainstorming day and the list got pretty long. There were a lot of funny and nice names but we narrowed it down to two. We were actually leaning more towards something else: it’s a combination of our names and it also means: “I like it,” in Korean. It sounded perfect! We loved the meaning behind it and how it represented us both but through our research it became clear that Bubbles and Kraut had more appeal. Alex: We tested the two names. I’m a huge fan of testing and Bubbles & Kraut won out. There were also practical considerations such as the surprising number of restaurants with the other name. But, once we decided on Bubbles and Kraut, it grew on us very quickly and now we can’t imagine it being anything different! Why are the services and products you’re offering important for today? Alex: Food waste is a big problem these days. In Austria, 760,000 tons of food is wasted every year. Through our workshops and our products, we’d like to raise awareness about the food waste issue and share our skills and solutions. Fermentation allows you to preserve food longer and our hope is that sharing this knowledge will have some measurable impact on food sustainability. Jo: There’s also the community aspect. We want to get like-minded people to interact with each other and share solutions, and enjoy food in the process. What is fermentation? Alex: A quick definition is that fermentation is the process of using the microorganisms that are naturally in the air to change the sugars in food into acid which helps preserve the food. What are some of the health benefits of eating fermented foods? Jo: In Korea, there is a belief that eating fermented foods is anti-aging so we believe that it’s good for your skin, and helps your body age gracefully. Alex: It’s good for your gut flora which helps in having a strong immune and digestive system. You feel less bloated or uncomfortable on a given day. There’s now some theories that the health of your gut flora influences many aspects of your body including your thought process and clarity of mind so it could help with productivity as well. What’s the working dynamic between you two? Who brings what to the table? Jo: My background is in graphic design so my strengths are being used for the visual aspects of our business like website design and branding. Alex: I’m handling more of the communications side of things. I’m also the scientist trying to create interesting new flavors and flavor combinations. I think we’ve settled into our natural roles. So far so good! Jo: We try to be honest and communicate. We’re both creative people so we’re always bouncing new ideas off each other. If there are any disagreements, we both try to focus on the fact that we’re both bringing our best and want what’s best for this venture. What are the values of Bubbles & Kraut? Alex: Sharing and sustainability. We both care deeply about these values. We want to share our knowledge about fermentation and food waste. On a practical level, we are trying to partner up with local farmers and use so-called ‘misfit’ vegetables that cannot be sold in regular markets. We also don’t want to waste our products so we’re going to try a made-to-order model. We will produce as much as our customers demand. We’d like to call this: FAIRmentation! Jo: I’d also say creativity and community. Because we are going to be using seasonal and local produce, we are going to get creative with the kinds of kimchi we will be producing. I know Alex is excited but I’m also excited to explore the new possibilities! And we are both really eager to build a movement and a community around these values. Even though you’ve only just started, have there been any challenges you’ve had to overcome? Jo: I think every day is a challenge for us. Everything is a first for us so we’re always trying to figure out the best way to get things done. I think we’re where we need to be and now it’s a matter of doing the work. Alex: Coordinating workshop venues, customers, and suppliers, even for a venture as small as we are can be logistically complicated. We know we need help and one challenge was reaching out to people and asking for help and realizing that It’s OK not to know things. What impact would you like to see Bubbles & Kraut have? Alex: I hope that we can teach people about preserving food. Fermentation has been used for hundreds of years but people all have fridges now so the art of preserving food through fermentation has gotten a bit lost over the years. We’d like to bring that back and show people what they’re missing. Jo: I’d like to see us having an impact in expanding the variety of food that is typically eaten here and opening up people’s minds to the wonderful diversity of food. What is it about fermented foods like kimchi that gets you so excited? Jo: For me, it’s such a big part of my life and my culture. Kimchi reminds me of home and I think it’s the perfect side dish for everything–not just Korean food, but European food as well. In Korea, we say that it has a cool flavor which is hard to explain in English. It’s kind of like, tasting a bit of the ocean. Alex: There’s a tangy and fizzy quality to kimchi that I just love. It has an incredible combination of flavors that I feel is like a taste explosion. It can be salty, sweet, and sour all at once. There’s also so many different kinds of kimchi. You’re never stuck with one kind so it never gets tiring. How can Impact Hub members help? Jo: We’re very open to everyone becoming our customers! Try our kimchi and join a workshop! Alex: We’re still looking to optimize our production process so if anyone knows of any farmers or shops that might be interested in working with us, please let us know. We’re also looking for maybe a restaurant or a kitchen that would be open to the idea of letting us use their kitchen downtime by allowing us to produce our products. Last question: who is Bubbles and who is Kraut? Jo: Technically, I am Kraut and Alex is Bubbles contrary to everyone’s expectations. But I feel that I’m a bit of both at times. Sometimes more Bubbles and sometimes more Kraut. Sometimes I feel like my head’s in the clouds and sometimes I feel more grounded. Alex: I like that. It’s a balance between the two. I think at the end of the day, we’re all Bubbles and Kraut. You can follow Bubbles & Kraut on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest.","May 4, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BK_Blog_Post_Cover-600x400.jpg"
"193","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/10/5-social-inclusion-movies-social-entrepreneur/","ImpactHub","5 Must-See Migration Documentaries for the Social Entrepreneur"," Migration and social inclusion are on-going themes that continues to dominate the social and political sphere. While everyone has an opinion on this subject, it’s important to try and see different points of view. The topic is heavy but it’s a reality of our ever-changing world. Looking away doesn’t change anything so for those who want to look closer, here are 5 documentaries about migration and social inclusion that you need to watch. Stranger in Paradise A mixture of fiction and documentary, this film depicts an actor (Valentin Dhaenens) in a classroom at a detention center telling real refugees about what Europeans think of them. It is brutal, powerful cinema and has to be seen to be believed. The Good Postman A wonderful documentary about your average person trying to do what they believe is right. It follows the election for mayor of a tiny and dying Bulgarian village on the Turkish border. Our protagonist is running on a pro-Syrian refugee platform believing it’s the key to saving his dying town but he faces resistance from some of his fellow villagers. It’s beautiful, sad, but true, and shows us that even in the smallest and remotest of places, this topic breeds division. Fire at Sea Pretty much the benchmark as far as documentaries about migration go, this absorbing and acclaimed film shows the lives of the people of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many migrants from Africa and Middle East, alongside the lives of the migrants themselves. The movie switches between the two and takes no position in either, simply showing what it’s like and asking the viewer to form their own opinion. Human Flow Chinese artist and filmmaker Ai Weiwei shines a light on the refugee crises occurring all over the world. Filmed across 23 countries, it’s an ambitious and exhaustive look at the plight of those who are just looking for a safe place to live. God Grew Tired of Us This film follows the journey of three Sudanese men who escaped the conflict of their home country and start new lives in the US. The three men come off as charming and noble as we watch them adjust to their new lives and the new culture that surrounds them. It shows what can happen when we allow people in. Winged Migration For the mathematicians, this is the sixth documentary on this list. On top of that, it’s decidedly not about the migration that we’ve been talking about. But, it’s a migration nonetheless. So if the other movies were a bit heavy, sit back and witness the beauty of the migration of birds and think about how we all deserve to be this free.

Habibi & Hawara is a restaurant and catering business in the heart of Vienna that serves Austrian Oriental cuisine. Their mission is to hire staff with refugee and migrant backgrounds to train them with the relevant skills to become successful entrepreneurs of their own. They are 2018 finalists of the found! program. Katha Schinkinger, director and shareholder of Habibi & Hawara. Photo credit: Deloitte, photo by Cochic PhotographyWhat does “Habibi & Hawara” mean? Habibi means “friend” in Arabic and Hawara means “friend” in Viennese slang. Both words are meant to have the same origin, so it’s a handshake in itself. What inspired you to start Habibi & Hawara? The idea came up in summer 2015 when Europe, and especially Austria, were confronted with a huge amount of refugees seeking asylum in Austria. Some friends and I started an initiative called “Hosten Statt Posten,” which means “hosting instead of social media posting.” We invited refugees from nearby camps like Traiskirchen (which were really overwhelmingly full at this time, making a very bad situation for the people living there) to Stadtflucht Bergmühle, which is a club countryside in the north of Vienna where you can eat very well and enjoy yourself in nature. It was meant to happen once or maybe twice, but we got into a little routine and ended up hosting more than 1,300 refugees, from summertime until autumn. Through this we got to know a lot of people. We saw a lot of entrepreneurial potential in the people that were coming at this time. We asked ourselves how long it would take for well-educated people, from Syria or Iraq for example, to open their own businesses. As we know from some studies such as those from OECD or the European Union, the average time it takes for a refugee to just find a job is about 4 to 5 years. That means it would take even longer for them to open their own branches or businesses. So, our idea was to build up a business that serves as an incubator for entrepreneurs. Since food is a common universal language, the logical step was to think of a restaurant. What are some of the challenges you’ve had to overcome to get where you are now? I think all challenges every startup has to face and then special challenges concerning gastronomy. Although it was an easy step to think of a restaurant, it was actually a weird idea because gastronomy is one of the hardest businesses — especially in Austria and Vienna, because we have so many good restaurants. So it’s pretty hard to be successful. My background is in marketing and PR, which is not unimportant in this field. So I think the brand is strong and doing well, but (laughs) it would have helped to have some ideas about gastronomy in the beginning… That meant we had to change a lot only in the first year. After making a few changes, it became more and more successful. We started with around 16 people, and now we have 24. 16 of these people have a refugee or migration background. The restaurant is now 2 years old – pretty young, we’re still in the toddler age, but it’s doing quite well. What do you think are some of the main challenges refugees face when they come to a new country? The biggest barrier is definitely the language, so that’s why we came up with the idea to offer a certificate in language courses. We’ve offered it since January this year. We have a certified language teacher coming in once a week, and our staff can join. They just don’t learn common German but also gastronomy-specific vocabulary which helps them to establish their skills. Another challenge is the image of a refugee in Austria. With the right-wing parties in Austria and other European countries, it’s hard for people seeking asylum facing challenges like this here in Austria, especially after dealing with so much in their home cities already. And of course, resettling and restarting their lives is quite a challenge. What impact would you like to see Habibi & Hawara have? What’s next for Habibi & Hawara? Our goal is to offer as many jobs as we can. We want to not only give jobs, but our staff should also grow and develop together with us. Our vision is to open branches, such as small takeaways. Our employees should become their own CEOs. Although we’ve been talking about restaurants and gastronomy, we are quite open-minded for other kinds of businesses as well. How can members of Impact Hub help you with your mission? Please be our guest and book us for caterings! Telling others about us via word of mouth will help, too.

"195","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/22/start-ups-the-european-voluntary-service-program-a-conversation-with-martin-pavelka/","ImpactHub","European Voluntary Service: Martin Pavelka","Let’s start with the basics, what is European Voluntary Service Program (EVS) and how did you decide to embark on this experience? European Voluntary Service is a program which enables young Europeans aged 18 to 30 years to live up to 12 months in another country working in a non-profit or social business organization. It is a program especially designed for those who want to travel, live in a different culture, learn a language and get a priceless international work experience. After finishing my studies, I traveled a bit and after spending a few months in the US, I decided to relocate to a different country for at least some time and EVS seemed like a perfect combination of everything. Why did you decide to do your EVS at Impact Hub Vienna and what were your tasks as a volunteer? I knew about Impact Hub from Bratislava but I was never part of it before. After seeing the opportunity, I was immediately impressed by how vibrant the community seems to be and being part of this platform looked like a great way how to broaden my own horizons. I was part of the Community & Membership team where we would facilitate the connections between members and create a platform where impact could emerge. It would include not only organizing great events such as the WineDowns, Skillshare Breakfasts, but also working with all sorts of online platforms and trying to boost our community of 500+ members both on- and offline. If a start-up founder asks you “Why should we take EVS volunteers?”, what would be your answer? Firstly, you not only get the chance to have a motivated and young volunteer who can support your team but also you give them the chance to show their potential and contribute to your activities. Also, by accepting an EVS volunteer, you are opening your doors to a different culture, world views & lifestyle which can be especially stimulating for your team. Looking back at the last year, what was your personal highlight of your European Voluntary Service? By being surrounded by such a diverse community and seeing amazing things happening right in front of you, one starts to believe that nothing is impossible. Thanks to being part of Impact Hub and EVS, I was able to dissolve all the mental blocks and fears I unconsciously built within myself in those 25 years of life and started focusing on what is really important for me. Also, coming to a new city without knowing anyone is a huge challenge that can be really scary. However, looking back, I realized how many beautiful connections I have made and I am happy to leave with the feeling that I have a place I can always come back to. How has your knowledge and understanding of (social) entrepreneurship & the impact of start-ups evolved? I had very little knowledge about social entrepreneurship and the startup scene when I started. Now, I am absolutely sure about the importance of impact startups in the current world where we are standing in front of some of the most complex problems. I see them as unique tools which have the power to start the transformation process on so many levels. How do you plan to use your experience of the EVS to solve societal challenges back in Slovakia or around Europe? Do you want to start any projects/ enterprises of your own? I realized I can never go back to anything other than an “impactful” job. Currently, I am preparing myself for my next journey which is in the area of international development. Europe, Asia or Africa.. I am absolutely unsure about where exactly it takes me but that just adds the flavor to it. How would you finish the sentence “For me Impact is…” .. when you forget about your own needs and desires and focus on what the world needs.

We all have different languages, different cultures, and different ideas. But at the end of the day, despite all our so-called differences, we’re all just people looking to do our best. Here are some ventures helping those who’ve come from afar, find their way: MTOP Their mission is to bring highly skilled refugees´to the labor market, connect refugees to companies, and break down negative stereotypes. MTOP offers an advanced training program that offers various workshops, and mentoring to prepare highly qualified refugees for the labor market. They enable refugees to find work suited to their skills, knowledge and experience while helping employers find the talent they need and increase the diversity of their staff. Over 20 companies have already benefited from MTOP’s talent pool. Topfreisen Topfreisen provides a social-culinary journey based on the idea that food connects people. Refugees cook food from their home countries for events that reach local people. Their “Topfreisen Academy” is a training course for refugees in gastronomy which aims to give them an easier and more sustainable access to the labor market in Austria. Kattunfabrik Kattunfabrik–the Cuture Lab helps integrate tailors who have fled their home countries into the labor market and works to develop the regional working places of the future. There are many challenges facing the future of the textile industry and they are prepared to face them. As a NGO, they offer practical and theoretical tutorship to prepare refugees for textile job market in Austria. Habibi & Hawara They are a private and independent incubator for future entrepreneurs as well as a social training and integration project for refugees and migrants with the goal of giving them an entrepreneurial tool kit to open their own ventures. In addition, Habibi & Hawara offer secure and fairly paid jobs, training programs, and an appreciative working environment. Habibi & Hawara is known for discourse and dialog but above all, they are known for their Austrian Oriental restaurant in the center of Vienna, which serves delicious food, and provides charming, professional, and friendly service, as well as interesting, relevant, and amusing cultural events. AFYA AFYA works with traumatized refugee children and adolescents in Vienna. Their project “Teaching Recovery Techniques” provides evidence-based, low threshold support for children and adolescents suffering from trauma. In a series of workshops, children and adolescents learn to gain control over post-traumatic stress reactions. reflect Launched in April 2017, reflect is an activist clothing brand embracing a unique and sustainable design method which focuses each season on a distinct disadvantaged, and invisible community. Through the communicative power of fashion, reflect makes the invisible, visible. Conclusio Conclusio was founded with the aim to promote mutual support between Austrians and asylum seekers. An essential aspect of Conclusio is empowerment. Instead of just receiving help, asylum seekers give help and can therefore give back to the local population. They are the winners of the Sozial Marie Prize for social inclusion in 2016 and the Lions Nachhaltigkeitspreis in 2015. CARamel CARamel is a social business actively supporting the integration of refugees into the Austrian labor market by offering a sustainable and innovative way of car-cleaning: a thorough wash and wax service, both inside and outside, wherever customers’ vehicles are parked (e.g. garages of offices, hotels, e-charging stations). The majority of their team of professional valet cleaners are refugees, the cleaning process is water-free, and their travel footprint is CO2 neutral. KulturenReich KulturenReich is a social enterprise that links foreign-born women in Vienna with the Viennese business community and government. They act as a catalyst in the integration process while helping Viennese businesses gain a competitive edge from the injection of new ideas and different perspectives. Their goals are to empower foreign-born women to be financially independent and successful, support companies to reach their diversity goals while enhancing their intercultural skills, and support government by helping to facilitate the integration of immigrants and foreign women in Vienna.

Canada is ranked third in the world for social innovation. “Apparently, our beavers are doing a great job!”, laughed Draimin as he addressed the audience. The social impact sector is growing, with new ventures, enabling organizations, and investors leaping into the market. “Social innovation is globally relevant, with national strategies as a main condition”, Draimin said. “Learning is an action”, and we cannot do it by ourselves. Presenting his insights from the book “Social Innovation Generation”, Draimin emphasized networks are necessary to create impact. Draimin suggests three main aspects when considering new strategies of social innovation potential and system change: Does social innovation intersect with mainstream innovation If innovation is the goal, then we need to understand what is necessary to move forward: comprehensive innovation, social impact, integrated innovation between businesses, social, and scientific/technological innovations. However, the core element of success is to be mission-oriented and inclusive. Which means finding something you are passionate about, driving innovation in the sector forward, and including all affected stakeholders. Moreover, it means finding a way to ensure no one in society is left behind when you create something new. Collaboration lies at the core of social innovation Reshaping ecosystems starts with engaging many actors in the system and bringing them together to work towards the same goal. Finding right people with similar interests and skills is the solution to achieving social innovation. Interplay of ecosystems, networks and platforms, is on what systems change relies on. Bridging established boundaries is the future of contemporary entrepreneurship. Consequently, it is also the biggest social innovation potential. This premise further informs how companies will grow in the future. A new innovation paradigm arises from these considerations, which includes: (1) content, meaning new methods, practices and regulations; (2) processes fostering inclusivity, co-creation, improvement, empowerment, people’s involvement, and cross-sector collaboration; (3) objectives create social value within new demands and social challenges.

Not only does a reader find friends within the pages of a book, new and old, he or she gains a wealth of new information. Reading also deepens our understanding of ourselves and each other. We gain greater insight into the plight of others through the pages of a book. We experience true empathy for the characters in books which translates to people in the real world. While scientists disagree on this point slightly, what they do agree on is readers of fiction have the tools for great and deep empathy. Being able to imagine yourself in place of another is important, especially as we are likely to experience more world-wide crises like the Syrian and Venezuelan conflicts. We wanted to present a broad picture of refugees across the world, which means our selection reflects the conflicts and milieus from across time and the earth. It was difficult to pick a few books to recommend to you because there are so many. The UNHCR put together a fifteen-page list of their recommendations. The Pen is mightier … Exit West by Moshin Hamid Shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2017, this novel is a brilliant narrative about survival and open doors. Two people meet in a Middle Eastern city gripped by civil war. Nadia and Saeed fall in love. Throughout the city, doors start to appear, magical doors which, once opened, can lead to anywhere and there is no going back. Desperate to survive, Nadia and Saeed take the chance and walk through an open door. The Guardian says “[t]here are no descriptions of life-or-death journeys in the backs of lorries or on flimsy dinghies. No middle passages. Just the cognitive shock of having been freshly transplanted to tough new terrains.” While the magical realism aspect of the book eliminates the need for perilous journeys in hostile terrains Hamid does not leave out the harsh descriptions of a city gripped by war and fear, “Hamid catalogues the casual devastation of a truck bomb, the sexual molestation that takes place as hundreds of city dwellers throng to take their life savings from a bank, and the supernatural elation of taking a warm shower after weeks on the road” writes Sukhdev Sandhu for The Guardian. Monsieur Linh and His Child by Philippe Claudel We have already recommended this book but it is so good and too important not to mention a second time. This is a tale of love, loss, and unlikely friendships. Monsieur Linh has just fled conflict and clutched to his chest is his infant granddaughter. “All those who knew his name are dead,” Maya Jaggi writes in her review for The Guardian. Monsieur Linh finds his reason for living, for continuing, and for making a gruelling journey in the face of his granddaughter. After his arrival in France, and his transition from temporary accommodations Monsieur Linh meets Monsieur Bark on a park bench. Monsieur Bark is grieving the death of his wife and struggles with a difficult past. They become unlikely friends, even though they cannot speak each other’s language. Each sensing incommensurable sorrow of the other. What is the What by Dave Eggers The book is based on the true story of a Sudanese refugee living in Atlanta, Georgia, Valentino Achak Deng. While the story and the outline of the facts are true, Eggers has taken some poetic licence and presents this as a work of creative non-fiction. Achak is one of the “Lost Boys”, a group of some 4,000 boys who were running from the violent destruction of their villages and the slaughter of their families. Eggers tells the story of Achak as a boy “[o]rphaned, starving and having walked 1,000 miles across West Africa when he was eight or nine, under constant threat of random slaughter from militias and wild animals”, Tim Adams writes for The Guardian. Achak then lived for fifteen years in squatters’ camps in Ethiopia before a charity organization arranged for his immigration to the United States. At the time the book was written Achak was working to put himself through college. What Eggers achieves best in this book, perhaps more so than others, is transmitting a sense of the permanence of temporary refugee camps. Achak lived in one camp, Golkur, for ten years. In the Sea there are Crocodiles by Fabio Geda This Young Adult book presents the life story of Enaiatollah Akbadi’s journey from Afghanistan to Italy. The young boy, left by himself in a new country by his mother, undertakes a perilous and fraught journey to find a new home. The place “You recognise it because you don’t feel like leaving”Enaiat states in his conversations with the author, Fabio Geda. Geda presents a “frank, revealing and clear-eyed testament of the experiences faced by a young asylum-seeker in the contemporary world” according to Diane Samuels at The Guardian. From his work at a hostel in Iran to his payment of people traffickers in Turkey, to a perilous dinghy ride to Greece, and his eventual arrival in Italy the book is crucial to understanding the plight of young asylum seekers in Europe. Sometimes a picture is worth more … Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches from Syria, Turkey, and Iraq By Sarah Glidden This beautiful example of comic journalism tells the stories of the people whom Glidden and her journalist friends encounter while working in Syria, Turkey, and Iraq. The book spans the totality of the refugee experience, from the story of the United Nations administrator to the Iraqi refugee deported from the United States. The art work which accompanies the stories is Glidden’s signature soft watercolours.","May 28, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Image-2018-03-30-at-10.53-AM-600x400.jpg"
"199","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/05/30/importance-words-refugee-asylum-seeker-migrant/","ImpactHub","The Importance of Words: Refugee, Asylum Seeker, or Migrant?","There has been lots of discussion about refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants over the past few years, and the terms are often used interchangeably and incorrectly–even by publications like the BBC. In reality, these terms have significant political implications for how these individuals are received into a country, the protections and rights they receive, and even how the receiving society might react to their arrival. In August 2015, the global news organization Al Jazeera announced that it would no longer refer to the people fleeing war to seek refuge in Europe as migrants, but rather as refugees. This is one example among many of the importance of consciously choosing the terms we use. Our choice of words sends a message, and using terms without thought can accidentally send messages we don’t mean. Unofficially classifying someone as a refugee or a migrant comes with certain connotations (something worth delving into deeper), but classifying them officially as such has concrete effects on their lives. For example, when the UN officially recognizes a certain group of people as refugees, they are granted different kinds of international protection that migrants do not receive. This is also why the topic can be controversial — who’s to say that migrants from other conflicts and countries don’t also need protection? Where is the line drawn when it comes to international aid? The conversation is complex and certainly multifaceted, but we can at least try to clarify one aspect of the conversation. Let’s take a look at the official differences between refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers. Refugee Refugees are people who flee persecution or war. They are seeking asylum somewhere outside of their home country because returning home is too dangerous. Refugees are officially defined and recognized by the UNHCR. They have specific protections according to international law, including the fact that they should not be sent back to their home country. Other official protections include governmental procedures (done by the receiving country’s government) to ensure they are granted safety and dignity (source). The “Refugee Crisis” in 2015 was officially acknowledged by the UNHCR that the majority of people in the movement were refugees since they were coming from recognized conflict zones and could not safely stay in their homelands. Asylum Seeker Though often interchanged with the term refugee, an asylum seeker is technically a little bit different. Every refugee is seeking asylum until the point when they are granted asylum. Sometimes people who are fleeing unrecognized conflicts or are unsafe in their home countries for other reasons seek asylum abroad. The decision of whether to recognize them as refugees depends on the individual case as well as the government of the receiving country. This decision is made with the international Refugee Status Determination (RSD) but is made primarily by the country rather than the UNHCR. The RSD process can take a very long time. If a country is not willing or able to make this determination, the UNHCR can step in to make the decision for them. Migrant A migrant is someone who decides to move, usually to seek a better life. This often to improved opportunities for work, education, or reuniting with family. The key difference between a refugee and a migrant is the fact that migrants are able to return to their home without being in danger. Migrants don’t fall under international law in the same way that refugees do. Instead, each individual country has its own set of laws for migrants (source). Because of this difference in laws for migrants and refugees, recognizing a group or an individual as one or the other can be extremely politically charged. The “Refugee Crisis,” while mostly consisting of refugees, also included smaller numbers of migrants. Further reading: Today’s protections of refugees, as well as the distinctions between refugees and migrants, are primarily defined by the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1969 OAU Refugee Convention, and the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. You can find more general information about migrants and refugees from UNHCR’s FAQ, as well as more in-depth information about the international laws on refugees on UNHCR’s website.

We have a number of ventures who work with refugees. A number of them are part of our accelerator program, found!. The program is a joint initiative by Impact Hub Vienna and The Deloitte Future Fund to provide support to social entrepreneurs who are preparing refugees for the Austrian job market, creating job opportunities, or helping build independent livelihoods in their new countries. I interviewed Jasmin Bauer of Kattunfabrik, an NGO that works with tailors by training and integrating them into the job market. Kattunfabrik is a finalist of the 2018 found! program. Where does the name “Die Kattunfabrik” come from? Actually, the name derives from a special form of woven cotton – called “Kattun” in German. We started as an NGO also directly in Sankt Pölten (a bit outside Vienna), where there was, in former times, a Kattunfabrik [calico factory]. Bringing this together, it made a perfect name for our NGO. How did Kattunfabrik get its start? Where did the inspiration come from? As we saw that more and more new people were arriving in Austria, we wanted to offer them what we could, a place where they have the chance to repair their worn-out clothes. This was just the beginning. Around 20% of the refugees come from the textile industry, so a lot of questions were asked about how they can do this as their living here, how to find work, and how to qualify. We did some great research and this was the starting point of “Kattunfabrik” – a workshop open to those who want to get back in the working market. What is the mission of Kattunfabrik? We train our workshop attendants in theory and with practical advice, we give them a broad knowledge of the technical language (in German) they have to face here and we train them on how to get back in the working market after they received their asylum status. But integration into the job market isn’t our only mission. We also care a lot about sustainability, about how to broaden the knowledge about how our clothes are made, and by whom. We talk at conferences and lead workshops on this topic to give people a chance to rethink their own consumerism. What do you think are some of the main challenges refugees (and especially tailors) face when they come to a new country? The hardest thing is to get the facts right – who can work under what circumstances, are there any exam papers for their profession – as the working conditions are of course restricted here in Austria. But we believe that working is an essential part of life and of being in a community. Thankfully, a lot of businesses are working to help refugees through their relocation. What is unique about the way your organization is working to solve these challenges for the refugee community? We not only focus on free time, we directly focus on training them to get back to work. As far as we know, there is no other organization doing this this way, especially concerning the textile industry. One of our main goals is also to point out that there is so much knowledge coming to Austria now, such as techniques and focus – we can merge this with the Austrian-based knowledge and re-create new ways of working here in textiles. What are your next goals and plans for Kattunfabrik? What do you hope to get out of your time in the found! program? We have already gotten so much out of it, thanks to our trainers and mentors from Deloitte and Impact Hub. We are now expanding ourselves and are currently in the process of opening a tailor’s shop with delivery service. Our personnel are taken from Kattunfabrik’s masterclass, so we directly introduce them to the working market and find a solid job base for them. Our new project is called wearrepair.","May 31, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/venture-interview--600x400.jpg"

Here’s what they had to say about collaboration with the global network, continued activities in the CEE region, and development of the social innovation ecosystem in Vienna. Tell us a bit about your backgrounds. Impact Hub Vienna new leadership© Anja StevicBI: I started my journey with Impact Hub Vienna back in 2008 when I was searching for solutions on how to bring business and social ideas together for my master’s thesis. I was one of the first members and am also one of the organization’s crowd investors. It was three years ago that I left the world of corporate and NGO work and officially joined the team. I’ve been learning to speak the language of startups ever since and using my background to support the impact ecosystem. LG: I was one of Impact Hub Vienna’s first employees and worked as a project manager for our flagship accelerator program–the Investment Ready Program. Together with a small team, we built Impact Hub’s acceleration machine from the ground up. We helped scale the Social Impact Award in partnership with WU, expanded IRP into new regions and steadily added new programs to our arsenal–quite a labor of love let me tell you. FB: For the last 11 years I worked as the Chief Operating Officer for REEEP – the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, a non-profit that aims at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems in low and middle-income countries. I was responsible for internal operations (Finance, HR, Governance) and IT & Knowledge Management in the organization. Working in a multilateral environment, with so many people dedicated to improving the lives of the most vulnerable populations was an invaluable experience for me. Coming to Impact Hub was a very natural progression, as the missions are very much aligned. Impact Hub has evolved from a co-working space to a startup accelerator to a local epicenter for everything social impact. How will that take shape in the future? BI: Looking back, it’s really incredible how this organization has progressed over time. Our first business plan included a headcount of around 2.5 people. Now, we’ve got 20 employees and a mix of revenue streams. Through it all, we’ve held one core belief–we don’t just sell coworking space or accelerator programs or event space, we are building a community. That will remain true in the years to come, but we’ll take it to the next level. We’re currently working on finding more opportunities for stakeholders like corporate companies, NGOs, and government organizations to form stronger collaborations with our community and understand how their expertise and resources can contribute to building a more sustainable, inclusive world. LG: I’d add that over the years, we’ve also learned a lot about the needs of social entrepreneurs. We are focusing on how we can adapt our accelerator programs to improve our support of these founders and ensure they have the right resources and network they need to be successful. FB: I agree that we need to take Impact Hub’s core mission of community to the next level by engaging with new stakeholders, and I think we have an interesting mix of backgrounds that put us in a great position to do just that. Barbara has a legacy of work with large corporate companies, I have a background working for an international non-profit, and Lena is heavily embedded in the impact investment scene. We’ll be working on showing these stakeholders how to approach innovation through the lens of social entrepreneurship to realize the economic, social, and environmental benefits. While Impact Hub Vienna was one of the first innovation centers in Vienna, many other players have since entered the space. How do you see Impact Hub’s relationship with the competition? LG: Impact Hub started as one of the first co-working spaces and we have always been very collaborative within the co-working and startup communities. I think a lot of players in this space act as “partners in crime” because we’re all building up an ecosystem for entrepreneurial action, and in order for it to succeed we simply have to support each other’s efforts. FB: Impact Hub Vienna and our community have a very strong identity. We have been a successful innovation center for more than seven years and it’s largely a credit to the team’s dedication to building an authentic place for the local community to come together and focus on impact, sustainability, and supporting people with an entrepreneurial spirit who share our core values. I think our approach remains very unique, even with the new players entering the ecosystem. IH is a global brand, yet functions on a local base. How with your relationship with the global network continue to shape work at Impact Hub Vienna? LG: We’ve always had a strong relationship with the global network on both strategic and network levels. The global headquarters is right here in Vienna, and we’ve worked side by side with them as Impact Hub grew from 20 Hubs to over 110. Impact Hub, as well as our members, benefit immensely from the cross-collaboration. Looking forward, we as a network are working on how to better connect our members cross-regionally, so an entrepreneur in Seattle can easily connect with a founder in Singapore to share knowledge and insights. There is incredible potential in our global network and we’re still exploring all the ways we can leverage this community. FB: Agreed. There are over 6400 startups in 50+ countries in our network–a huge asset to Impact Hub Vienna, our partners, and our members. For social impact startups, the opportunities such a network allows when they begin to scale operations into new locations is invaluable. BI: We’re also always learning from other Impact Hub’s and visit them often to get introduced to their models. We tap into each other’s expertise in community building, hosting, and use our collective knowledge as a network to better serve our community and support the movement of social innovation globally. We also frequently host other Impact Hub teams to share our journey and lessons learned, as Impact Hub Vienna is considered a center of excellence within our network. Impact Hub Vienna has expanded its accelerator programs throughout Europe and beyond. What do you see as Impact Hub’s role in continuing these programs throughout Central and Eastern Europe? LG: Our Investment Ready Program was set up as an international project since the beginning as was Social Impact Award. Each of these programs grew internationally with Impact Hub Vienna as their headquarters. It’s really a testament to the fact that this team and partners in this region are key actors in the spread of social entrepreneurship. Now, Social Impact Award has grown so much it’s become its own entity operating in over 20 countries. Impact Hub Vienna will continue to focus especially on the development of social impact in the CEE region. Currently, we work closely with partners like the Austrian Development Agency to develop projects in the western Balkan region, which we will continue to do in the year to come. Our regional activities help these countries learn about the potential of social entrepreneurship and build academies.

"202","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/06/illustration-one-man-show/","ImpactHub","Illustration is a One Man Show"," Coming across the beautiful, carefully crafted drawings beside text always made me wonder, how do they come to be? What does it take to translate text into an illustration? I sought answers from the talented illustrator Marina Muun, who has already built an impressive portfolio of inspiring illustrations. During her four-year long freelance career, she contributed to Nature, The Wall Street Journal, Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls, and many more. During warm Friday afternoon, we met on the sunny terrace where she shared her illustration journey with me. Wall Street Journal© Marina Muun“Elucidating written concepts is the biggest challenge, but also the greatest strength an illustrator can possess”, admits Marina. It is a skill which develops over time, “usually you have to come up with something interesting, witty, or poetic “. But it’s not just a pure representation of the text, the illustration also has to add to it and reveal something hidden to the reader. “That develops your conceptual thinking”, mused Marina. With a bunch of colorful drawings spread across the table, I tried to understand the depth of the call. “You need to move within the space where you are always trying to reinvent your work, stay true to your style, otherwise, you can get bored”, continues Muun, adding that for a freelancer it is pretty hard to divide a personal and professional time. “I don’t give myself office hours, and I love working outside.” Even though illustration can be solitary work, it is certainly never monotonous. There are always different things to explore, depending on the variety and pace of the projects. Sometimes it is an editorial or children’s book drawing, but it can also be a big commercial campaign. Marina is receptive to the wide spectrum. “There can be beauty in everything”, she adds, smiling. © Marina MuunIn the process of developing the next illustration, it is important to focus and find a satisfying creative solution, for both the client and the illustrator. “Making the right communicative message is the goal. In personal work, it is similar. A bit more fluid, but I give myself a task, and then I try to figure it out”, explained Muun. As we talk more about the sometimes strenuous creation process, an interesting thought comes ahead. “Creativity is trying to say something, a manifestation of person’s expression. When I look at art that I like, it is usually because it spoke to me and said something that I appreciate. It can be just the colors or the combination of the symbols. It is so subtle and abstract, hard to define.” Seeking for inspiration doesn’t seem to be an issue in a digital world, where online libraries serve the purpose. “As browse through it, sometimes I just wonder why did I ever save this weird thing”, says Marina laughingly. You never know when a certain symbol or image might come in handy. UC Davis© Marina MuunDeveloping a certain style is the absolute imperative in the field. Illustrators are known for their distinctive use of color, shapes and drawings, that set them apart and guarantee fitting commissions. Each illustrator crafts their own field of activity, some lean towards fine art, others into motion or murals. It depends on each person, “how they push out the walls of their bubble”, explains Marina. Ultimately, this doesn’t create competition, since each individual is hired because of their expertise. For Marina, her style, or brand came natural, not planned. “I do tend to use some colors more often, but it is a very spontaneous choice. They end up looking similar, because it is just my sensibility about the color”, says Muun. With increasing demand for new skills, such as motion and animation, her unfulfilled dream it to team up with a motion designer and work on an interdisciplinary project. For now she wishes to work more the books.","June 6, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RockGarden-600x400.jpg"
"203","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/13/radical-candor-work/","ImpactHub","Radical Candor: What is it and how does it work?"," Do you ever want to be honest, but are worried about being too honest? Radical Candor™ allows you to establish a management framework where you can challenge your co-workers directly while caring for them personally. Being professional often means biting your tongue. But sometimes the truth needs to be said. A failing of many organizations is the lack of honest communication. Programs or initiatives are sometimes executed poorly because nobody felt like they could point out flaws. This isn’t just an issue with big multi-national corporations with thousands of employees. Impact Hub Vienna has also looked to Radical Candor for guidance. After our introduction to the core concepts of Radical Candor, we chat with Dušan Jankovic, Community Catalyst at Impact Hub Vienna to dig into a first-hand practical application of Radical Candor to see how it has impacted his team. What is Radical Candor? Radical Candor comes from the book, Radical Candor: Be a Kickass boss without Losing your Humanity, by Kim Scott, a former Google employee who led AdSense and YouTube, who was inspired by the leadership of her boss at that time, a certain Sheryl Sandberg of now Facebook and Lean In fame. How does it work? Given our general propensity to beat around the bush, we have been taught to talk around things instead of talking about things. This is in part due to the desire of avoiding any social awkwardness, which we all know can be quite uncomfortable. Radical Candor sets up an environment where the things that need to be said, will be said. At its core, Radical Candor has 2 dimensions: Care Personally and Challenge Directly. You put those two together and you get this very nice equation for the math people out there who don’t like numbers: Radical Candor = Care Personally + Challenge Directly. It’s not about confrontation or awkwardness. It’s about getting to the truth of the matter. What is Care Personally? Care Personally is about caring for your team and caring about the work. In order to facilitate a caring relationship with your team, you need to open up to them and talk more than just shop. You are a person who is more than their job so don’t be afraid to show your team that. What is Challenge Directly? Challenge Directly is about challenging your team to do their best. You also need to set the tone of being direct and honest. Your co-workers and subordinates will pick up on that and embrace how you cut straight to the point. Keep in mind though, the goal is not to be mean, it’s to be helpful. How do you do it? Like anything, practice makes perfect. Implement it in your team and do the 3 P’s of practice, practice, and practice. It might feel uncomfortable at times, especially at the start, but that might mean you’re taking it personally which is what you shouldn’t be doing. But hey, don’t listen to me, I just write about it. Let’s check in now with Dušan to see how Radical Candor really works. What inspired you to implement Radical Candor? I wanted to look into how we can embody the benefits of Radical Candor at Impact Hub Vienna. I wanted to develop a culture of direct and clear feedback that would be shared instantly while creating stronger personal bonds within the team. If we can achieve this, we would be able to continuously grow as individuals and as a team, allowing us to have more impact. Have you noticed any disadvantages? We’re adopting a phased implementation so it’s still too early to say anything definitive but I have not seen any major disadvantages so far. There are challenges though, mainly to do with getting other people on-board and changing the team culture. Although people who are part of our team are open-minded and fast learners, changing the culture is always tough! So for anybody out there taking their first Radical Candor steps, a good starting point is to make sure to introduce everyone to the concept and have buy-in from the entire team. After that, it’ll still take some time so be patient with the culture change. How has Radical Candor changed your relationships and meetings? So far, we’ve only had one “all hands” meeting where we were sharing what worked in the previous period (successes) and what could have been better (learnings). People really enjoyed it! Right now, we’re looking into how to integrate this as part of our regular agenda during our “all hands” meetings. I feel that with this framework, we’re becoming more effective in terms of the way we communicate When it comes to relationships, what helped me was the clear distinction between the “care personally” and “challenge directly” concepts that Radical Candor is based on. So on a personal level, I feel that the quality of interactions and the time spent with the team has improved. Do you plan to continue using Radical Candor? Definitely! Although, we’re not going line by line by the book. We’re adjusting the approach as we go so we can learn and use the things that work for us. The next step would be to take it outside of our team and spread it throughout the organization.

On the contrary, they should benefit from tourism, both economically and culturally.” UNESCO and World Tourism Organisation (2000) Everything in the way we live our lives can be sustainable. It starts with environmental consciousness and the realization we have control over how to use time, products, vehicles, and everything else in our daily lives. the idea of a sustainable lifestyle is on the rise, across all sectors. To this end, sustainable tourism is becoming increasingly popular. Last year was marked as International Year of Sustainable Tourism by the The United Nations. The goal was to raise global awareness about how responsible and sustainable tourism can have a positive impact. The main suggestions given to achieve this included environmentally conscious practices, cultural and natural heritage protection, and providing social and economic benefits for local communities. Leading sustainable lifestyle starts with small steps. You might decide, one day, to travel by bike or train, or simply walk around the city. Or you might decide to recycle more, reuse old containers, compost, or not buy a new article of clothing when one might be repaired. All of these small choices lead to a more sustainable lifestyle. With this in mind, it is important to consider the upcoming holiday season. If you are in the midst of planning your vacation, we have pulled together some important tips and insider considerations for taking a sustainable holiday. Green Destinations and Eco-tourism Almost every country has a dedicated green destination. The Green Destinations named top 100 places in 2017 that are the leading example for sustainable tourism. Ensuring the integrity of the ecosystem is what the purposeful travel to natural areas is all about. Understanding the culture and history of the environment, while taking care of the surroundings, makes the perfect ecotourist. For those who are staying in Vienna, fear not, because the city has a lot to offer as a green destination. According to the Wien Tourismus, you can visit one of the largest organic farms in Austria. Spread over 860 hectares, three city farms cultivate organic land. To spend a sustainable day in the city, this guide may come handy. Yoga Retreats This globally popular activity is getting more attention, especially when it comes to healthy and conscious interaction with the environment. Yoga retreats offer physical and mental regeneration in a sustainable community of like-minded people. Daily exercises and meditations, vegetarian and vegan kitchens, and following nature’s cycle are the keys to sustainability on these much vaunted holiday trips. Tree Houses Or why not choosing one of popular tree houses, such as Baumhaus Lodge in the Lower Austria. Holidaying in a treehouse has never been more earth conscious.","June 19, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/map-600x400.jpg"

We have curated some amazing cake recipes for you. However, as we were searching the internet and cookbooks to find the best recipes, we realized we didn’t know the origins of Birthday Cake. The Surprising History of Birthday Cake According to Reader’s Digest, the origins of birthday celebrations are in the ancient world. More specifically, the Ancient Egyptians. “They believed when pharaohs were crowned, they became gods, so their coronation day was a pretty big deal. That was their “birth” as a god,” Reader’s Digest writes. One can only imagine the level of lavishness of the food at those celebrations. However, modern birthday cakes have their origin in this part of the world, specifically Germany. Reader’s Digest writes children in eighteenth century Germany would receive a cake on the morning of their birthday, called Kinderfeste, and then would not eat it until after dinner. I would call this a more intense version of the marshmallow test. As with any form of dessert across Europe at the time, money and ingredients limited access. Which means only the wealthy children had Kinderfeste. According to Reader’s Digest, birthday celebrations and cakes did not become popular until the Industrial Revolution because of the cost. The Industrial Revolution brought the beginnings of automated production, the burgeoning middle class with disposable income, and the opening of trade routes across the planet. All three factors coalesced into more people being able to celebrate birthdays with cake. Which is awesome. Cake Before and After Okay, we just wanted to take a few minutes to talk about modern cake invented in the Industrial Revolution and cake before. I learned this all from Great British Bake Off when Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc chatted with various food historians in England’s far flung manor houses. Cake prior to advances made in the Industrial Revolution were made of flour, yeast, honey, dried fruit, and nuts. Think Kugelhopf. However, bakers cultivated yeast by leaving the flour and water in a bowl. Alternatively, cakes could also be tortes, which is a flatter cake made with no leavening agent. Think Sacher Torte. Baking Powder was not invented until 1843 by Alfred Bird and then we started using that to make cake. Which is how we get the lighter fluffier cakes. Think Black Forest Cake or Lemon Poppy Seed Cake. Or any of the light and eggy French cakes or any cake which Mary Berry has ever made. The proliferation of refined sugar also made cakes different. Sugar combined with eggs to form airy peaks and create more rise in a cake. The same could not be accomplished with honey or beetroot sugar. This results in a lighter, airier cake with a soft crumb and an even texture. I am pretty sure I just quoted something Paul Hollywood says in every cake episode of Great British Bake Off. We Have Dessert, Now Let’s Light it on Fire Birthday candles also have their origin in the ancient world. This time we have the Ancient Greeks to thank, according to Reader’s Digest. They used to bake moon shaped cakes as an offering to Artemis. They would light candles on the cakes to imitate the light of the moon. Again, the modern incarnation of the tradition originates in Germany. According to Reader’s Digest, the Kinderfeste cake would have candles to equal the age of the child plus one extra, called the light of life. Reader’s Digest says the candles burnt all day and the child would blow all the candles out after dinner. The Good Stuff We baked a cake last year. It was vegan. And it was delicious. You should check out our recipe, which we made especially for you, the Impact Hub Vienna community. However, if vegan coconut cake is not your thing, and we understand, we found some other recipes for you. However, it is hard to tick all the boxes of vegan, gluten free, or seasonal all in one cake. We found the best recipes in all those categories for you. While our cake is vegan, some people like chocolate better than coconut. This recipe even comes with an extraordinarily indulgent frosting. Avocado is the fat used in the recipe and in the frosting in place of butter. This one is also gluten free, because they use a pre-made gluten free flour blend. If you do not like eating gluten free things you can substitute regular or cake flour instead. The best gluten free cake I have found is from Nigella Lawson. Her recipe for clementine almond cake is soft and moist. This is one of my favourite cakes and the one I make for myself. You can frost this with orange cream cheese icing. The batter is thick and tastes bitter, so don’t try to eat it before you bake it. Once baked, the sweetness from the almonds, the clementine juice, and the actual sugar make cake heaven. It is currently cherry season. I cannot go into a grocery store without seeing the glossy dark red, slightly sour fruit. Really, we just chose this for the frosting and filling. Also, because who doesn’t want a three-layer birthday cake covered with chocolate ganache, cherries, chocolate chips, and cherry frosting? Don’t forget… If you want to enjoy cake in a party atmosphere with all of us at Impact Hub Vienna, don’t forget that it is our birthday party on today. See you there!

"206","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/26/storytelling-business/","ImpactHub","Storytelling for Business","Your company might have something important to tell its audience, but if you don’t tell it in the right way, then it’s not going to be heard. That’s where storytelling comes in. You already know your product or service is great, but getting someone else to buy into it is another story (pun intended) altogether. The thing is, storytelling doesn’t always come naturally — it comes with practice. You could read a dozen how-to guides on the internet for how to tell a story, or you could check out courses, consulting agencies, and more that will let the experts make sure you’re telling a good story. Let’s look at some of the resources out there for really getting good at storytelling. Courses, events, and resources If you’ve looked at Impact Hub’s calendar recently, you might have noticed that we’re hosting a company called EPIX for an event on June 15th for an Empathy and Storytelling workshop. Even if you can’t make that event (or have already missed it), there are lots of other events out there for learning how to become a good storyteller. Keep an eye on the Impact Hub calendar, but also check out other similar events or courses hosted elsewhere. Other events hosted in Vienna include storytelling workshops (such as this one led by Rafal Bojar). There are also consulting agencies that you might want to look into, especially if you haven’t done much with storytelling before. Agencies and consultants in Vienna include Ferras, .kloos, zukunvt, The Story Dude, and lots more. Of course, not every up-and-coming business has the capital to spend on attending expensive workshops. Sometimes the fest resource is the one right at our fingertips: the World Wide Web. Webinars are often available, as are online courses and articles with hints, tips, and tricks. Free or cheap online courses can be found at Coursera, Future Learn, Udemy, and other similar websites. You can also sign up for email courses offered by companies such as ECHO Storytelling Agency. There are tons of other ways to get some tips and tricks for becoming a good storyteller. Books going back thousands of years teach about how to persuade and communicate a story. Luckily, there are plenty of books written for this era, too. Check out The Story Factor by Annette Simmons or Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip and Dan Heath. In case you couldn’t tell, there are tons of resources out there. All you really need is the will to learn, and you can get good at storytelling for your business using whatever route works best for you.

"207","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/06/28/summer-reads-learning-on-the-beach/","ImpactHub","Summer Reads: Learning on the Beach"," It is a beautiful sunny day outside (except for the day I spent writing this post). The temperature inside and outside is more like a Finnish sauna than most people think is reasonable (again, except for the day I decided to sit down and write). All we want to do is go for a swim and sit in the shade of a tree doing absolutely nothing, (EXCEPT for the day I decided to tell you all about the books you should take to the beach). We know you don’t want to take your laptop to the beach, not to mention the risk of it being stolen or ruined by a stray piece of hard plastic from a random beach activity. And no one wants to read business books when it is gloriously sunny and warm. However, you can learn from fiction and creative non-fiction. In case you missed it, we chatted about that exact subject in the book round up on Refugees. We scoured the internet and our bookshelves for the best summer reads. Some of these are light hearted and others examine the complex nature of humanity through tragedy. However, all of these are worth the read on a sunny day. On the Shelves … The Girl Who Smiled Beads: A Story of War and What Comes After – Clemantine Wamariya Clemantine Wamariya is a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. She is six years old when she starts her story, her parents are speaking in whispers and her neighbours start to disappear. Wamariya and her older sister spent six years running through seven countries, hoping with each one to find a haven. Eventually, they sought asylum in the United States. Wamariya’s story encompasses the horrors of war, the true costs, and the after effects for survivors. For those working in migration, inclusion, and with refugees this book is an absolute necessity. For the rest of us, this book is an absolute necessity to better understand the predicament of those who find themselves newly displaced. Calypso – David Sedaris David Sedaris’ exercises his characteristic wit and charm in this latest collection of emotionally charged essays. Sedaris confronts his sister’s suicide, revisits the loss of his mother, his own health and mortality, and attempts to emotionally cope with the new frailty age forced on his father. The book fundamentally questions what it means to be a family when people live far apart and see each other infrequently, especially as age catches up with us all. Some essays are the expected Sedaris family antics, others chronicle the reasons why he now has a garbage truck named after him and met the Queen of England (it is the same reason), or Sedaris’ desire to feed his recently excised fatty tumour to a snapping turtle. This book is just necessary. I can write lovely sentences about how this is essential for those working in mental health and social inclusion. Or about how, if you are struggling to laugh or see the bright side you should read this book. Described as “cheerfully misanthropic” on the back cover the stories are heart-warming and incisive in a way only Sedaris can be. The Book of M – Peng Shepherd This is a stunning debut novel by Peng Shepherd. A global catastrophe hits, people are losing their shadows and with them their memories. The book begins with a shadowless man speaking perfect English walking into a fire because he forgot what it was. The fantasies of the shadowless are becoming reality. The story follows Max and Ory. Max loses her shadow and Ory pursues her, not willing to give up the time left with their shared memories. The book questions the power of connection when your world is turning upside down. Magical and heartbreaking this book is a must read for everyone working in a constantly shifting world or for anyone trying to find their feet in this ever-moving sea. From the way back machine … Never Let Me Go – Kazuo Ishiguro Kazuo Ishiguro is 2017’s Nobel Laureate in Literature. This is a book is earth shattering. The novel presents us the reader with halcyon school days and summer afternoons spent in cottages watching rain storms. The three teenagers around whom the book revolves are caught up in the dramas of adolescence: dating, love triangles, shelving artistic dreams, and other such problems we all confront on the cusp of adulthood. A deep sense of hopelessness pervades the book. The children at this beautiful school in a rambling old country manor are human organ farms. I love this book and keep coming back to it. Everyone should read this book. It is an attempt to understand what makes us human and what connects us to each other. Good things come to those who wait … Severance – Ling Ma Ling Ma brings us a world brought down by a swift and sweeping plague. However, the main character, Candace Chen, is so focused on her daily life and routine she almost doesn’t know what is happening outside the tiny box she has made of her life. Part apocalyptic novel, with mindless zombies continuously refolding t-shirts instead of devouring grey-matter, and part meditation on the Chinese immigrant experience, the millennial main character is the daughter of immigrants. Ma won a prize for a chapter of this novel in 2015. This book is essential for anyone looking to break out of the drudgery of every day, meaningless jobs, or change capitalism. I have only read reviews because the book does not hit shelves until August but it is one of the most eagerly anticipated reads of the summer. A picture is worth a thousand words … The Prince and the Dressmaker – Jen Wang Jen Wang brings us a powerful and beautifully drawn tale of the power of friendship and the danger in being a secret. This graphic novel tells the tale of two people who are secrets, Prince Sebastian and his friend, Frances. Prince Sebastian sometimes wears dresses and takes the world by storm as Lady Crystallia. Frances is the dressmaker who makes his fantastic frocks, she is his secret weapon. His life is secret from everyone but two people, especially his parents who are pressuring him to marry a woman, any woman. Frances is Prince Sebastian’s secret. This distinctly modern fairy tale is a heart-warming and romantic story of friendship. If these books don’t suit your fancy, or if you would actually rather read business books on the beach. We have tonnes of other recommendations. You can check out our top recommendations for entrepreneurs, futurism, inspiring women, tech for good – analog edition, leading ladies, messes, and sticking to it.

"208","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/07/02/investment-ready-program/","ImpactHub","Investment Ready Program","This spring, more than a dozen CEE ventures applied for the Investment Ready Program (IRP) to try and get the helpful resources and customized support that comes with it. The first module of the program took place in April, while the local cohort meetup was in May. This month Module 2 will take place. So, what does all this mean for the ventures? The program itself consists of four months of personalized support from experts, business tools, and resources. At the end of the four months, the ventures will then get to participate at CEE Impact Day, where they can pitch to investors to help secure the future of their business. The Investment Ready Program is valued at €15,000 for each venture, although it’s hard to quantify the value of gaining a network of useful resources. Better yet, it lasts for a lot longer than just the initial 4 month period. IRP keeps in touch with its alumni and will keep networking along the way for at least two years after the start of the program. So far, IRP has already helped out 90 ventures. This Year’s Ventures There are 15 impactful ventures involved in the program this year. They’re located in Austria, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Kosovo. Their industries range from food and nutrition to manufacturing, from arts and culture to lifestyle and fashion, from agriculture to education, and more. All of the ventures are aimed at making a positive impact in their communities and in the world. Some, such as the restaurant Freshys, donate a large portion of their profits to the needy (food for the homeless, in their case), while others specifically employ and train people with disabilities (as is the case the IT company HubIT). There are quite a few ventures focused on health and sustainability in connection with food or food production this year, such as Hut & Stiel, MamaOrgana, No Name Farm, Vrtlari, and Hrana Za Site. Of course, this brief description doesn’t do these ventures justice — you can find a complete list of the ventures in the cohort on IRP’s website.","July 2, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/irpblog-600x400.jpg"
"209","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/07/06/working-smart-healthy-working/","ImpactHub","Working Smart – Healthy Working","We all want to be healthier. We want healthier workplaces because we spend so much time there during the week. The World Health Organization (WHO) says “healthy workers are more productive and raise healthy families.” Healthy workplaces are one of the key strategies for alleviating poverty, according to the WHO primer on Occupational Health and Safety. However, you might be a freelancer, a small start-up with only a few employees, a “solo-preneur,” or any number of other categories in which you find yourself looking to keep yourself healthy while you work because there is no formal employee wellness program (unless you make it for yourself). We pulled together some tips for staying healthy during the workday. Everything from taking the stairs instead of the elevator (you know who you are) to issues with eye strain. Get Up and Move Around Take the Stairs This is a simple option. There are a few short flights of stairs to the first floor from the main floor. Even taking them once a day is better for you and the environment. It builds up your cardiovascular health and you will gradually get stronger, according to MyFitness Pal. However, there is a mental health benefit too, according to the popular healthy lifestyle app blog. “Every time someone makes a decision to start a new healthy habit, especially something physical, it ends up being what is referred to as a ‘keystone habit,’ which makes starting other habits easier — kind of like a domino effect,” the blog reports. Researchers at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada found taking the stairs helps to slow brain aging. We have given you at least four good reasons for your physical health to take the stairs one floor up, however, there is a benefit for the environment as well. The benefit here is simple, you save energy by not using a mechanical lift and reduce yours and the Hub’s carbon footprint, according to an article in The Guardian. Walk Everywhere We know you do not work in a traditional office environment because you work here with us. However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be walking to or from meetings. If your meetings are close by then take a walk. If not, then walk from the nearest ubahn rather than taking a ride share or a bus which will drop you off at the door. The benefits of walking are endless. The Mayo Clinic reports everything from a trimmer waistline to strengthening bones and muscles. Also, the time away from your desk will give you a chance to clear your mind. Stretch It Out Stretching has a myriad of benefits. We usually incorporate it into our daily exercise routines. However, incorporating stretching into your routines at other points in the day has unexpected benefits. According to the Baltimore Business Journal, stretching decreases your risk of repetitive strain injuries associated with offices work and increases your productivity. Food and Drink Water That simple word should be enough. However, it can sometimes be hard to get all the water your body needs in a day. According to The Greatist, water can help boost your productivity, fight sickness, and reduce eye strain. Try setting an alert in your phone or fitness tracker if you struggle to get enough water during the work day. Food Healthy eating is important, like water, it can boost productivity and fight sickness. Eating fruits and vegetables have a myriad of wonderous benefits. We really do not need to list them here. Try buying fresh vegetables from the nearest grocery store, to which you walked on your break, or try packing a sack lunch. Eye Health Have you heard about the 20-20-20 rule? This means taking a twenty second break, every twenty minutes, and looking at something twenty feet away (about six meters). Medical News Today reports this can help you prevent eye strain while you are using the computer intensely. According to the Mayo Clinic, eye strain can cause not just dry eyes but headaches and neck problems. Remember, take a break. Go for a walk. You will be more productive if you feel energized and you are not in pain. Happy, healthy working.

We are serious. Inc. reports reading is “one of the best ways to get that disengaged rest.” If you are not a meditator, not all of us are or can be, you can achieve the same peaceful relaxation through reading. We have pulled together a list of some of the best meditative reading around. The benefits of reading fiction are myriad and surprising. According to the same article in Inc., reading is one of the most effective ways to combat stress. Within six minutes of starting to read our heart rate slows and our muscles release their tension, according to research performed at the University of Sussex. Regular fiction readers also report sleeping better, according to Inc.. Readers of fiction have better lifelong cognitive function, showing less characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia as they age, according to The National Academy of Sciences. And these are just the health benefits. Our advice, head to the bookstore and pick up one of these recommendations to help you rest. On the Shelves … The Sea, The Sea – Iris Murdoch Originally published in 1978, The Sea, The Sea examines what drives us all. And the face we present to the world. The story follows playwright and director, Charles Arrowby, as he attempts to write his memoirs but just end up falling in love with his adolescent crush all over again. The book won the Booker prize that year. However, we did not recommend it for Arroby’s self-aggrandising reflections or for the kidnapping plot that goes horribly awry. Murdoch is also a philosopher. In her paper, The Sublime and The Good, Murdoch postulates we need art and beauty to learn and understand the higher moral truths. The Guardian writes the book is “variously sublime, ridiculous, difficult, facile, profound and specious.” The prose is complex and detail oriented, including the descriptions of many off-putting meals had at Arrowby’s new home by London’s theatrical set. Give yourself a few hours of rest and enjoy the quirky comic nature of this philosophical read. Such a Long Journey – Rohinton Mistry I read this book when I was seventeen and it remains one of my favourites. It is a work of fiction I return to repeatedly. Mistry’s novel follows Gustad Noble, a bank clerk and member of the Parsi community in Mumbai in 1971. It follows Noble through the daily interactions of his life to major family events, like a son refusing to go to a prestigious school or a daughter becoming ill. The tender side of Noble comes out in his daily interactions with his neighbour, Tehmul, who has cognitive disabilities. Amidst government plots, gargantuan sums of money, and painting the walls of his apartment building with all the world’s deities to prevent people urinating near his windows, Noble discovers who he is and for what he stands. Winner of the Governor General’s Award in Canada, it is a spectacular meditation on the person in turmoil. I would highly recommend this literary tour de force from one of Canada’s great authors. Rebecca – Daphne Du Maurier Du Maurier dares to give us a protagonist without a name, only a role, Mrs. De Winter, Mistress of Manderley. Rebecca is the name of Mr. de Winter’s first wife. The novel is rife with self-doubt and fear. The narrator’s anxiety is palpable in every glove dropped. The reader pulled deeply into the world of Manderley, from the sophisticated and suave Maxim de Winter to the spiteful housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Du Maurier leaves no stone unturned in this psychological exploration, even looking at the thoughts leading to suicide and the bullying behaviour of those around us. The Novel Cure, a compendium dedicated to helping readers find solace for their emotional ailments with the exact perfect book, recommends this book for those suffering from low self-esteem. Less – Andrew Sean Greer Winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize, this book is a meditation on aging in a world which increasingly leaves the aged behind. The protagonist is Arthur Less, who is a minor novelist, white, gay, and knocking on the door of fifty years old. These are his meanderings through the world on various literary engagements. He is avoiding turning fifty company and the wedding of his one-time lover. The Guardian writes “novels about novelists are always a risk, but Less is about anyone who has allowed their calling to define them at the expense of their humanity.” This is for anyone who struggles with purpose in their daily life. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words … How to Survive in the North – Luke Healy This is an irresistible story with arresting pictures. The narrative is three distinct stories, two real life arctic expeditions weave seamlessly with a fictional present-day character. The stark colour palette is reminiscent of the aurora borealis, which finds its way into all tales of arctic exploration, including these three stories. The work is a meditation on life in harsh conditions, survival, and what it means to be human. Student reviewers at Concordia writes Healy’s work “combines two stories of isolation to create a stunning look at human emotion.” The narrative has two distinct notes with respect to isolation. The first is being physically isolated, as Ada is, alone on an island. The second is isolation in the modern age, as Sully is, when he is on sabbatical weathering the storm of his affair with a student. This book explores what it means to be truly alone. If you want more fiction, we have been recommending quite a few books recently, last month’s list encompassed fiction across a broad array of subjects.

However, we have yet to talk about food, one of the key ingredients to good health. We asked two of our food ventures to give us some delicious summer recipes. Habibi & Hawara Habibi & Hawara sent us their delicious falafel recipe, and it also happens to be Aboudi’s mother’s recipe. While it is not specifically super healthy it is so delicious that the happiness you get from eating it will be the health benefit. Aboudi’s Falafel Serves 4 people Ingredients 250g dried chickpeas 1/2 large onion, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander 1/2 tbsp dried coriander 1/2 tbsp cumin Juice of 1 lemon Scent of salt 1/2 tsp baking powder Oil for baking Instructions Soak the chick peas in plenty of water for at least 12 hours, and preferably for 24hours(if you are in a hurry, 500g canned and drained chickpeas will do too.) Drain the water and pour the drained chick peas together with the onion, garlic, parsley and coriander (fresh and dried) into your blender or food processor, and (using the finest blade) pulse until everything is blended but not pureed. Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl. Add the lemon juice, baking powder, salt and cumin to the mixture and stir well. Heat the oven to 200°C and cover a baking tray with baking paper and lightly grease. Roll the mixture into small balls of about 3 to 4 cm. Place on the prepared tray and lightly brush the balls with oil. Put the balls in the oven at 200°C for approximately 20 minutes, turning after 10 minutes. Bake until the falafel is crisp and golden. Enjoy with friends and family. And what do you serve with falafel? Tabouleh, of course. This healthy salad is also courtesy of our friends at Habibi & Hawara. Habibi & Hawara’s Syrian Tabouleh Vegan; serves 6 people Ingredients 2 bunches of parsley 1 cucumber Juice of 2 lemons A handful of mint leaves (Instead of mint you can also prepare the Tabouleh with lemon balm). A garlic clove 3 Tomatoes Some black olives to taste 1 bunch of spring onion 1 cup bulgur (fine) Pomegranate seeds Salt and pepper 1/2 cup olive oil of good (organic) quality 1 cup of cold water Instructions Swell bulgur in cold water and lemon juice for about 5 minutes. Due to the lemon juice, the bulgur also softens with cold water. Loosen with a fork – the grain should be loose crumbly. If necessary, add a little more water. Finely chop the onion, garlic and herbs and mix with olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl. For the tomatoes, core the seeds, cut into small pieces. Peel cucumber, halve lengthways and remove seeds with teaspoon, dice. Roughly chop olives. Put everything in the salad bowl and mix. Fold in bulgur as evenly as possible. You should taste the salad and, if necessary, season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Leave in the fridge until the next day. Garnish with pomegranate seeds. Enjoy! Tip: Serve as a starter or side dish or for barbecues, also refreshing as a main course in summer.

We’re all busy, so how do you get the information you need without wasting your time? There are so many documentaries and other resources out there that it can easily make your head spin. To simplify things at least a little bit, we’ve compiled a list of 5 health-focused documentaries worth your time. Food, Inc. Made by Robert Kenner, this documentary opens our eyes to the food industry of the United States. It delves into the unpleasant realities, even the ones that are endorsed by the governmental regulatory agencies. It shows us that just a few corporations put prioritize profit over just about anything else. Whether it’s workers’ health, new strains of diseases, or widespread obesity, Food, Inc. opens our eyes to it all. Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret Cowspiracy forces us to examine the truth behind an industry that many prefer not to think about: animal agriculture. The major environmental impacts of this harmful industry are clarified, but that’s not all. You’ll also be amazed at the reluctance of the environmental organizations to really do much — or even talk much — about it. Believe it or not, you’ll find yourself laughing along with the humor in this enlightening documentary. Forks Over Knives Forks Over Knives is a thoughtful documentary that examines obesity and disease in our society. It highlights the fact that obesity (particularly in the United States) is worse than ever, the number of diabetes cases is skyrocketing, and prescription drugs are running rampant. It looks at a possible (and likely) solution: skipping processed and animal-based meals. You’ll be so impressed with this doc that you might go vegan without a second thought. You can find it on Netflix. Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead This film follows the life of Joe Cross, who is obese and goes on a mission to get his health back. It shows how he can’t get much from doctors or medicine, so he instead goes for his last remaining option: changing what he eats. He takes it to the extreme by cutting out everything besides vegetable and fruit juices for two months while traveling across the United States and interviewing fellow Americans about health and food. If you’re in need of a little inspiration to live a healthier life, this one is for you. Fast Food Nation Although not technically a documentary, this movie is loosely based on the book, also titled Fast Food Nation. It tells the story of the marketing director of a fictional fast-food chain. After a scandal, he goes to investigate one of the company’s meat processing plants to uncover the truth. It is a comedy-drama that will both entertain and open your eyes to the parallels between this fictional world and our own.

I know that might be a controversial statement for some but let’s face it, winter starts and ends later than ever and I’m dripping sweat as a write this from my cave. These movies aren’t 100% accurate to the climate science but in movies, what is? If you want to experience climate change from the comfort of your home, leave the AC off and check out the following movies. The Day After Tomorrow Like many, I paid to see this glorious entry in director Roland Emmerich’s never-ending oeuvre of destruction extravanganzas. Due to climate change, a series of super storms develop above Canada, Scotland, and Siberia and the weather everywhere goes apeshit. Characters try to explain what’s happening but then end up running away from climate-related disasters that can kill them. Jake Gyllenhaal at one point has to outrun really rapidly advancing frost. What more do you need to know? Geostorm As weirdly interesting as this movie is, it’s probably the last one you should make a point of watching on this list. It stars Gerard Butler who once again swaps his charming Scottish brogue for a North American accent. The plot concerns people who need to shut down malfunctioning natural disaster causing climate-controlling satellites which were put in place to stabilize the effects of climate change! I guess the lesson is you’re damned if you do, and you’re damned if you don’t. A cautionary tale of extreme forms of geoengineering. Waterworld A classic from the 90’s when Kevin Costner was the biggest star on the planet and could do no wrong. In this movie, the polar ice caps have melted covering the world in water and Kevin Costner plays a man with gills and webbed feet over 20 years before The Shape of Water! It’s an enjoyable action-adventure movie typical of the era and at the time was the most expensive movie ever made. At the beginning of the movie, Kevin Costner recycles and drinks his pee. Let’s just hope we don’t have to resort to that kind of stuff anytime soon. Snowpiercer If there’s one movie to watch on this list, it’s this one. Another classic from Korean director Bong Joon-Ho, it’s adapted from the French graphic novel La Transperceneige. The world has frozen over after an attempt at climate engineering and the last of humanity lives on a train that never stops. The poor are at the back of the train and the elites are in the front. It’s brilliant and brutal stuff. And the immortal Tilda Swinton’s in it. The American President This is a bit of a cheat since the movie isn’t really about climate change at all but more of a romantic comedy involving the President of the United States (not the current one). Many of you might not know, but in the mid-nineties, climate change (previously known as global warming) was also an issue that needed to be addressed. Not much has changed since then but in a rousing speech towards the end of this movie, President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) puts forward legislation that will cut fossil fuel emissions by 20% demonstrating that in the alternate universe of a movie made over 20 years ago, things are going well.","August 3, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Inspiration-on-Film-The-Best-Documentaries-for-Social-Entrepreneurs-BLOG-COVER-600x400.png"
"214","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/08/16/top-5-places-for-forest-bathing-vienna/","ImpactHub","Top 5 Places for Forest Bathing in Vienna","During times like these when the Viennese heat seems unrelenting and inescapable, you might be daydreaming about dropping yourself into a tub of ice. But have you ever considered taking a different kind of bath? That’s right, you guessed it: I’m talking about forest bathing. In case you haven’t heard of it, forest bathing (or Waldbaden in German) is the practice of immersing yourself in a forest. You gently walk through the trees with no real agenda other than just taking it all in. These days there is even some science to back up its relaxing effects on your mind and body. In a city that has tons of city hiking trails (Stadtwanderwege), it’s easy to get caught up in the act of getting from A to B. While that’s also enjoyable, on a scorching hot day you’d inevitably end up drenched in sweat in a mere matter of minutes. So you might instead prefer a slower, less athletic pace. That’s where forest bathing comes in. If you’re still not convinced, just remember: in a forest there are trees. And where there are trees, there is shade. Let’s take a look at some of the delightfully shady forest bathing spots around Vienna. Here are our picks for the top 5 places for forest bathing in Vienna. Wienerwald You’ve probably heard of it — the Vienna Woods, better known as the Wienerwald, is the perfect spot for a nice, refreshing forest bath. You can walk around the woods for a while, calmly absorbing your natural surroundings. Once you get bored, you can enjoy some lunch or dinner here, head to one of the local museums, or do a different kind of bathing at the thermal baths. The Wienerwald is a pretty big place, so more specifically check out the hillsides of Kahlenberg, where forest bathers might stumble upon old castles, gorgeous views, and precious plants. Semmering A visit to Semmering makes for the perfect day trip from Vienna, especially when you’re in search of greener (aka slightly less hot) pastures. There are tons of different activities to do here, including hiking, biking, and, of course, forest bathing! If you want to get up into the mountains with as little effort (and sweat) as possible, try taking the ski lift up, then just enjoy the Alpine beauty up above. The Lobau If you’re looking for something with more of an exotic jungle vibe, the Lobau is your place. Sometimes referred to as the “water forest” and situated in the Donau-Auen National Park, the Lobau is a great place to go if you want to get a more literal form of bathing. You can even swim in some of the water you see along the way! As a wetland, the Lobau is a unique ecosystem containing tons of different flora and fauna. Listening to the sounds of the water forest makes for the perfect forest bathing experience. Forest Bathing in Graz If you want to get super legit, you can do some “real” forest bathing in Graz. Although it’s not technically in Vienna, it could be worth the trip for the aspiring expert forest bather. Waldwelt offers workshops in forest bathing as well as some other relaxing and foresty activities. Wien Weinwandertag Okay, this admittedly has nothing to do with forest bathing, but it’s imperative that you know about it. Sometimes all you can do to forget about the heat is to drink wine with your friends. What better way to do it than while enjoying the hillsides of the Viennese wine country? Although it will (hopefully) have cooled off by the end of September, if you’re like me, then you’ll still be recovering from the misery of the current heat wave. That’s why you need to know about the Wiener Weinwandertag (in English it’s called the Vienna Wine Hiking Day, but it sounds cooler in German). You get to wander around the hills and vineyards of Vienna, stopping for wine as you go. This year it’s happening on September 29th and 30th, so mark it on your calendar — maybe I’ll see you there.

Many politicians use this issue for their own political purposes and are likely not as knowledgeable about the subject as they might claim to be. So don’t be swayed by popular opinion or by what some people say, go find the information yourself and be informed. Podcasts are great for this. The long form of a podcast allows you to dive deep into a subject. If you’re still itching for more content about migration and social inclusion after making your way through our must-see documentaries list, here are our picks for 5 great podcasts about migration and social inclusion. BBC – The Documentary Podcast The BBC World Service are producing a fantastic podcast series about a variety of subjects. If you go into their archives from 2015, you’ll find their series The Year of Migration, which has a series of episodes about the migration issue from all sides. Migration Nation While everyone is trying to project and look forward to see how migration will impact the world, Migration Nation looks back and documents the history of migration in the United States of America. Discover how bourbon whiskey was invented, the impact of enslaved migration, and how the Yankees settled the Midwest. Freakonomics: Is Migration a Basic Human Right? Pretty much everyone knows this podcast given its consistent ranking at the top of the charts. It’s fun and informative and shines a light on a variety of different topics within the broad subject of economics. One of their episodes from 2015 was about migration and it’s a sobering exploration into the topic asking the question we should all be asking ourselves: is migration a basic human right? Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies If you want to go deep into the weeds on this subject, check out the podcast from the Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies of the SOAS University of London. Experts and academics give lectures on their area of expertise ranging from cross-cultural migration in Eurasia since the 1500’s to integration of migrants in the United Kingdom. Small Changes – The Guardian This podcast focuses on the topic of global development and is a series of one-on-one interviews with people who see problems in the world and then go out and solve them. The topics of migration, sex education, disease, women’s rights are all explored. The issues might be vast and complex, but if this podcast teaches us anything, a small change is better than no change.","August 24, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Image-2018-03-13-at-7.43-AM-600x400.jpg"
"216","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/08/31/get-back-swing-things/","ImpactHub","How to get back into the swing of things","Summer is coming to a close sooner than many of us hoped, but that doesn’t mean September has to be depressing. It can be tricky to snap out of the delightful vacation mode and get back into work mode, but I’m confident you can do it. Take a look at a few of these tips to help you along the way. Think of it as a new year You know that fresh feeling of possibility at the start of a new year? Maybe it’s from a new year’s resolution, or maybe it just feels like you get to reset and have a fresh start. It’s really just all in our heads though, isn’t it? Try replicating this feeling at the start of September, as if it were January 1st! Think about the goals you want to accomplish and all the possibilities that lie ahead. This could help you hit the ground running rather than dragging your feet when you’re trying to get back into the swing of things. Reconnect with colleagues The Austrian workplace has one guarantee over the summer: someone is bound to be on vacation at any given time. While vacation is awesome, it’s also nice when everyone is around at the same time. Look at the start of autumn as an opportunity to reconnect with your colleagues. Chances are they’re also feeling the Summer’s End Blues, so they will probably appreciate a chat. If nothing else, you could go for a drink after work and commiserate together about the pain of being a working adult. Misery loves company! Treat yourself If you can remember back to your childhood days when you were going back to school this time of year, you might recall a feeling of excitement. While students have their own reasons to be depressed about the end of summer and the start of school, there was always something new and exciting involved: a new class, new friends, new school supplies, new clothes, or whatever it may be. Try to replicate that feeling into adulthood and treat yourself a little bit. Buy yourself a new pair of shoes or a new gym membership, or start a new healthy habit (such as food or exercise). Remember, treating yourself doesn’t have to revolve around consumerism or sugary treats. Try treating your mental and physical wellness with some healthy nutrition and whatever else it is that makes you really feel good. You deserve it! Allow yourself to catch up Don’t set the bar too high when you’re just coming off vacation. If you aim to suddenly be the most productive you’ve ever been, you’re bound to feel disappointed. Instead, cut yourself some slack and take it step-by-step. Don’t be surprised if it takes a few days to really get back into work mode. Better yet, consciously set time aside to answer emails you missed and organize your schedule. You’ll be back to it in no time!

"217","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/09/04/the-basics-of-sustainable-production/","ImpactHub","The Basics of Sustainable Production","It is fundamentally distressing to think we cannot stop being consumers. We need to eat, to use energy to heat our homes, and even passively use wires to communicate with friends around the globe. We produce everything in some way, whether farming food, generating energy by massive steam turbines, or extruding metal into wires. All of this has an impact on the environment and people. Whether it is through farm labour, the fuel used to power the turbine, or the chemicals used in the extrusion processes. Sustainable production is one of the options to reduce our impact, environmental and human, as individuals and as society. Can the famer hire fair seasonal labour? Can we use wind to power the turbine instead of fossil fuels? Can we find a more environmentally friendly to refine metals? Consumers most often hear about sustainable products with respect to farming practices and food production. Sustainable production is more than farming without pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Sustainability crosses all industrial sectors. It affects all consumer goods and services. The Basics The basics of sustainable production are simple, according to The University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, “sustainable production is the creation of goods and services using processes and systems that are non-polluting, conserving of energy and natural resources, economically viable, safe and healthful for workers, communities, and consumers, and socially and creatively rewarding for all working people.” The Lowell Center states one of the conditions for sustainable production is valuing “longer-term consequences and benefits over short-term profits.” This means placing higher value on healthy workers, communities, and ecosystems far into the future over immediate growth strategies. For larger, established organizations this means changing long-standing processes and suppliers. The Lowell Center suggests “investing in well-designed safer products, resource efficient technologies and processes, and trained and empowered employees.” The advice is applicable for new ventures and start-ups. New companies have the advantage of being able to create sustainable processes, policies, and practices from the very beginning. The Benefits of Sustainable Practices Large- and small-scale producers benefit from adopting new and sustainable operating procedures. The World Economic Forum states “sustainability drives purpose and passion for employees.” People “want to feel great about what they do every day,” according to the World Economic Forum. This means consumers and producers. Whether it is eating apples or farming them, we all want to feel good about ourselves, our jobs, and our impact. This borne out by research into employee engagement within the Human Resources sector. Daniel Pink, in his book Drive, states employees need to be connected to the purpose of an organization. They need to feel part of more than posted profits, financial growth, and revenue streams. Corporate social responsibility programs, sustainable production practices, and collective impact projects all help to bolster employee engagement. The World Economic Forumreports many companies who post high revenues while adopting more sustainable business practices, “take Whole Foods, for example. This is one of nine companies in the sustainability space with revenues worth more than $1 billion, alongside eco-friendly innovators such as Tesla, Chipotle and Natura.” “Not only are companies making money, but they are growing their market share by being sustainable,” according to the World Economic Forum. Unilever has an impressive track record, its “16 ‘Sustainable Living’ brands are becoming increasingly important to the company, growing more than 50% faster than the rest of the business and accounting for 60% of growth in 2016,” according to the same report. The employee engagement, increased profit, and increased market share are impressive lures for any company looking to convert to more sustainable options. For consumers, the benefits are numerous. Often one-time expenditures mean less money spent over time, an example is disposable diapers versus cloth diapers. While the upfront cost for several sets of disposable diapers is more than a box of disposable diapers, consumers spend the money a few times throughout the infant and toddler years. Repairs often cost less than purchasing a new item. Sometimes, they free and consumers learn new skills in the process by accessing local repair cafes. Which means more money saved in the pocket of the consumers. Market Trends The University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership published their report on trends which will affect the industry over the next several years. The report lists eight key trends, “volatility is the new normal, sustainability to shape the face of business, extreme loss and damage from extreme weather, human versus machine, China and the global shift to the East, the end of an era for plastic, a watershed year for transparency, life after coal.” Our Ventures are Leading the Charge At Impact Hub Vienna our ventures are at the forefront of the sustainability movement. Iss Mich is a sustainable caterer offering you a wide variety of event options made with food which would otherwise be thrown out. Food which simply does not meet the narrow definition of consumable. Which means it has to meet a specific standard, like carrots have to be perfectly straight. However, Iss Mich takes this produce and makes delicious food for your events. Erdbeerwoche’s mission is twofold; provide girls and women with education about their periods and to provide consumers with sustainable options for their periods. Products made from organic cotton or reusable goods can be purchased. Their products are good for the environment and consumers’ pocket books.

"218","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/09/06/sustainable-spotlight-an-interview-with-alpengummi/","ImpactHub","Sustainable Spotlight: An Interview with Alpengummi"," We connected with the producers of Alpengummi, Sandra and Claudia, to chat about their new sustainable chewing gum venture. It was a great conversation concerning the sustainability of ingredients and traditional industries. Check out their thoughts on the viability of healthful ingredients in chewing gum in this thought-provoking interview. What made you start Alpengummi? We met during our first year of our environmental sciences master’s program in Copenhagen. In the second year at BOKU in Vienna, we had a course together about innovations in the forestry sector. We were encouraged to write a plan for a fictional business idea. We started to investigate what kind of innovation could possibly be done in a forest – and we came across the tree resin. We found out that resin is chewable and that people were already chewing it thousands of years ago. In the Austrian countryside, people still know all about it – it’s called Kaupech. We also came across the old process, Pecherei, which is a way of extracting resin from pine trees in lower Austria. This art has become part of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2011. Once it was an important and booming industry. Eventually it was substituted for fossil fuels and cheaper imports. Pecherei once shaped the landscape, culture and economy of this region and formed the livelihood of thousands of families, has shrunk to only a handful of active resin extractors, Pecher, and one of the last independent resin extraction companies in Central Europe. We started to wonder how conventional chewing gums are made. We realized the producers do not declare the ingredients of their “gum base”. When we looked for more information we realized big companies refuse to these types of questions. As a result, we assumed these are most probably made of synthetic polymers, similar to those used for car tyres and rubber gloves, which only adds to the list of synthetic and harmful ingredients in chewing gum. Sandra and Claudia in the lab (c) Ignacio RodriguezHow did you come up with the name Alpengummi? We grew up in the Alps. From the heart of the Alps to the foothills, where the pine forests can be found. It just came naturally to us that the first natural chewing gum of the Alps should be called Alps’ gum, Alpengummi. We did not have to think about it at all, the name was just there – even before we started to make it. Why is your product important for today? What makes it sustainable? What’s the value proposition? When we look at the chewing gum sector, we see that there are still only a handful of natural alternatives – most of these use Chicle for their gum base, the tree sap of the Mexican Sapotille tree that grows in the rainforests. This is great, but it’s not economically viable for Europe to import from Mexico if we have local trees that make a great gum base. Our entire Alpengummi is made of natural ingredients like pine resin, bees wax, birch sugar and natural flavours. We use birch sugar, which does not cause cavities. Sustainability is part of every aspect of our company – from our suppliers, transport and production to our product packaging which is created as naturally as possible in the food sector. Our chewing gum is also bio-degradable and does not contribute to the global waste problem. What are the environmental benefits of switching to Alpengummi? By chewing Alpengummi, you support renewable resources like the tree resin. Pine trees are harvested over decades. As both the pine resin and the birch sugar are obtained from trees, you support forests that form a valuable ecosystem for endangered species and play an important role in the carbon sequestration of the planet. We use bees wax from small beekeepers that let their bees fly on orchard meadows for our gum base. What are the values of Alpengummi? Besides being a sustainable business, we want to be fully transparent. This means we list all the ingredients we use and tell the stories of the people and places where we source the raw products. We want that people know what they are chewing. We wanted to get back to our roots. We want to show sometimes the solution lies in the old and traditional. Resin was chewed in Austria by people in the countryside and it was in the very first chewing gum made in the USA. In looking for solutions in older processes we are also supporting the dying arts of Pecherie and beekeeping. Have there been any challenges you’ve had to overcome to get to where you are now? The first challenge was to create a chewing gum. We knew that resin can be chewed, but it was a big challenge to create a gum base from the resin that was actually chewable and delicious. The biggest challenge we face is the market is dominated by big companies. More than 94% of the worldwide chewing gum market is dominated by one multinational company. We have been in contact with several people who are willing to help us establish our product in this market. One of our biggest supports is AWS (Austria Wirtschaftsservice), who have helped with funding to get us started on our way. We don’t feel like we are facing this challenge alone. What are some of the milestones you’d like to achieve in the next year? The biggest milestone is to get the prototype done and ready. We are still working on the design and packaging. In 2019, we want to start to sell our chewing gum. There are many steps to take before we get to sales, like a detailed distribution plan. What impact would you like to see Alpengummi have? We hope Pecherei will get more attention and support. Hopefully, the resin will be used for more products and more people will work in the industry. We want people to know what they are chewing. To that end, big companies will have to declare what they use for their gum base. We hope it will become common to have natural chewing gum. How can members of Impact Hub help? As we are entering the world of funding and investors, it would also be great to get advice from people who have gone through this before.

"220","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/10/23/living-off-grid-using-clean-energy/","ImpactHub","Living off grid using clean energy"," We’ve all dreamed of being free from the rules and requirements of modern day infrastructure. What if you don’t want to be connected to the public power grid? In many places, you are legally required to be connected to the local infrastructure which isn’t an unreasonable request. But if you’ve ever been frustrated by an electric or gas bill, you’ve likely dreamed of taking your energy generating needs into your own hands. Being off grid is a fairly broad term that encompasses many things. It could mean being completely disconnected from anything: you generate all your electricity, sewage, food, and heating needs yourself. But it also means using clean energy solutions to power your own home whether you’re connected to a local electrical grid or not. So if you want to generate your own power, what are your options? Solar The most well-known and accessible option is putting solar panels on the roof of your home. Nowadays it’s pretty straightforward and you can also use solar trackers for added energy generating efficiency to get that extra bit of sun. With solar trackers, your panels move along with the sun to ensure maximum exposure. Every year, there are new technological breakthroughs as solar cells become more efficient and costs drop. They’ve even figured out how to make solar panels nearly invisible if you’ve got a problem with how it looks. Wind energy Wind energy is energy generated by the flow of air. You’ve probably seen the giant wind turbines dotting the landscape in various parts of the world. While it might seem that buying wind energy is your only solution, there are small-scale wind power setups available if it is appropriate for where you live. Micro hydro Micro hydro is a type of hydroelectric power. Unlike hydroeletric power which uses large infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs and can harm the local ecosystem, micro hydro power is all about keeping it on a small scale by using a minimal and natural flow of water. The power generated from micro hydro installations produce anywhere from 5 kW to 100 kW. To give you an idea of how much that is, a 100 kW can power a home or a small business. These kinds of systems often complement solar systems making up for the shortfall of sun during the winter. Geothermal Geothermal energy is using thermal energy from the Earth to make power. While it’s possible that there is enough geothermal energy to power the entire world, the energy isn’t available everywhere and exploiting hard to access geothermal energy is cost prohibitive. Smaller scale geothermal power plants are increasing in popularity but these are still industrial level solutions. If you’re looking for a geothermal solution for your home, check out a geothermal heat pump which transfers heat to or from the ground to manage your home heating and cooling needs. Upfront costs are high but with subsidies and the amount of money you’ll be saving on your heating and cooling bill, the system should pay itself back in a few years. So what if you can’t put solar panels on your home or set up a wind turbine or generate your own micro hydro or geothermal energy? Switch to an energy provider that provides clean energy. Go out there and do your research. There are energy providers who produce clean and renewable energy. So even if you you might not be able to generate your own clean energy any time soon and be completely off grid, at least you can support the energy you would like to generate.","October 23, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clean-energy-off-grid-banner-600x400.jpg"

"222","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/11/19/smart-cities-best-practices-around-globe/","ImpactHub","Smart Cities: Best practices from around the globe"," A smart city is a city which uses data and technology to more efficiently manage assets and resources. This can be a city’s water supply, electrical grid, waste management system or all of the above. Economists estimate that smart cities could save 22 trillion dollars by 2050. With such a wide-ranging definition and with another city going smart every day, it’s easy to get a bit lost in the whole idea of a smart city since all of them are doing different things. Every city has its own unique challenges and being smart is just about finding innovative ways to solve them. Some smart cities are built from the ground up while others are trying to do their best with what they’ve got. Songdo, South Korea If we’re going to talk about smart cities, we’ve got to talk about the world’s first: Songdo, South Korea. Built on reclaimed land from the Yellow Sea, it is the largest private real estate development in the history of the world projected to cost $40 billion. With plenty of LEED certified office spaces, elevators which go to the ground floor the second you enter the building, and trash being taken and sorted using pneumatic tubes from your apartment, it’s designed to be the business and residential city of the future. Sensors all over the city continually monitor and optimize road traffic, electricity, and the flow of water. San Francisco, USA It shouldn’t be a surprise that one of the most expensive places to live in the world has also been on the forefront of implementing smart technology in the city’s infrastructure. Approximately 40% of the city’s electricity comes from renewable energy and the city has recently expanded its demand-responsive pricing policy for parking. Prices for parking spaces dynamically increase or decrease based on demand. The results of the pilot phase concluded that average parking rates were lower, parking availability increased, and greenhouse gas emissions decreased because people no longer had to circle endlessly to find parking. Trikala, Greece Referred to as Greece’s first smart city, Trikala has only 82,000 residents but all its services are connected. In the city’s control room, a worker can see the status of traffic lights, water pipes, available parking, and even the locations of each and every garbage truck. The city’s e-complaint system allows citizens to submit a request for services either online or through an app. Problems are now solved in eight days on average. This might still sound like a long time until you think about how it took a month to solve any issue before the city went smart. If that weren’t enough, there’s also self-driving buses, more efficient streetlights, and even a Raspberry Pi kit for every public school in the city. Estonia All of Estonia. Not just the capital Tallinn but the whole country where 99% of public services are available online all day every day. The only things you have to leave your house for are to get married, get divorced, or buy real estate. Everything else can be managed online. You can found a company in approximately 18 minutes. Estonians can even vote online and they’ve been doing it since 2005. Online voting has been estimated to save 11,000 working days per election. These are just a few of many smart cities and smart countries around the world. For fellow Impact Hub Vienna members, don’t forget that the city of Vienna is also a smart city with various projects tackling challenges in sectors such as energy, health, transportation, buildings, and the environment.","November 19, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-19-at-12.41.11-PM-600x400.png"
"223","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/11/27/fundraise-wisr/","ImpactHub","How to fundraise WisR","Raising money is a must for any new company looking to spread its wings and it’s one of the bigger challenges a startup will face. You need to prepare the right documentation, meet investor after investor, and that’s if you’re lucky enough to even get a meeting. Fundraising can take up to six months and go on even longer. By that time, many entrepreneurs just want to get it over with. But even if the process is arduous, for those who’ve jumped at the first sign of interest and Euros, it was something they soon regretted. Once an investor jumps on board, it becomes a relationship. They might be aligned with your interests or they might not. This is something you need to figure out before you accept any money. If you don’t, you might find yourself spending your days babysitting your new investor instead of building and expanding your business. Earlier this year, one of Impact Hub Vienna’s program members. WisR, successfully raised a seed round of 250,000 euros in just two months! Carina Roth, Co-Founder and CFO gave a talk on all the ins and outs of what they did to get the terms they wanted and the amount they needed in the time they wanted to spend doing it. Here are 8 key takeaways on how you could do the same. Talk to your peers! Find the companies who’ve successfully raised funds and chat with them over coffee, lunch, or whatever. If possible, find companies who are similar to yours to find out how they did it and what they would do differently. They’ve already gone through the process and have learned tons while doing so. Many are happy to share what they know. Prepare, prepare, and then prepare some more Everything you do now, you won’t have to do later. Show your potential investors that you know what you’re talking about by having all documentation ready to go. This includes all the standard issue things like slide deck, executive summary, cash flow projections, profit and loss statements, and depending on what stage your company is in, the assumptions you made to get to those numbers. This even includes contacting your lawyer and preparing the term sheet. This isn’t to say that the terms are already set in stone, but by preparing well in advance, it forces you to think about these things so when you’re the face-to-face with an investor, you’re prepared for all questions and know what you’re talking about. Contact everyone at the same time but start collecting names months in advance Don’t wait for one investor to bow out before you talk to another. Start collecting names as soon as you can and if possible, reach out and contact them even before you’re thinking about raising money just to keep them in the loop about what’s going on. Send an update with every milestone you hit. When the time comes to raise money, they’ll already know who you are and what you’re about. Keep your e-mail short and simple but with all the necessary information. You will be contacting lots of people and you don’t want to spend the next month constantly answering questions. Be transparent You shouldn’t have anything to hide so don’t hide anything. Show them who you are, what you do, and what you want to do. If they like it, great! If they don’t, then it’s not a match. Be upfront with your terms and the ticket size of each investment. Tell them what kind of investor you’re looking for. Don’t hide things to accommodate the wrong investor. Be transparent to find the right one. Think about the next round Your focus is obviously going to be on raising money right now but when doing so, there are things to consider for the next time. The choices you make now could affect your ability to raise more money later so it’s important to think ahead. For example, set appropriate ticket sizes. Lots of investors with small investments doesn’t look good on the capitalization table so set appropriate ticket sizes. Also, make it a prerequisite to participate in a subsequent round because if you get to the next round and everyone from your previous round bails, that also doesn’t look good. You want long-term investors who believe in your business, not short-term ones who are only looking to make money. Ask, ask, ask! Ask your potential investor questions. Is it their first investment? What companies have they invested in before? How would they feel if things didn’t go according to plan? If they have good answers to these questions, go even further and do your due diligence on them. Call and talk to the companies they’ve invested in and ask about their relationship. How many times do they want to meet? How do they behave? Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you commit to an investor. Credit: Timar Ivo BatisSet a deadline If not, investors think they have all the time in the world to make a decision. A deadline allows them to focus their attention and even motivates them to share the information with other potential investors. Everything moves faster when there’s a deadline and it can create a demand which is what you want. You want to be able to choose from a bunch of potential investors, not just one. Confidentiality agreements Depending on your business, they might not be necessary. It might be obvious, but don’t hand over all your confidential documents during the 1st meeting. Trust your gut. If you meet an investor and don’t trust them, there’s no need for a confidentiality agreement because you shouldn’t be showing them your confidential internal documents anyway. These 8 key takeaways are just some of the main points covered in the talk. Check out the whole video for even more detail on the actual terms of WisR’s seed round financing.

"225","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2018/12/19/deep-impact-measurement-impact-society/","ImpactHub","Deep impact: A guide to impact measurement"," Impact measurement remains a big challenge for social businesses across the world because it’s just not as straightforward as dollars and cents. To truly capture impact, a social venture might need a larger allocation of time and resources. It’s important to get acquainted with some of the standard metrics and data points of impact measurement. Measuring lasting impact usually requires a long-term study but there’s plenty of information to communicate to stakeholders prior to that. Ultimately it’s the mix between data points and longer-term studies which paint the full picture of social impact. The Framework There’s no one impact measurement framework but the most common one involves an assessment of a business’ inputs (the resources available), outputs (the activities and services of a business), outcome (the change created), and impact (the long-term effects). Unfortunately, impact is the area which requires the most amount of resources to measure so if a company is short on resources, it’s best to focus on outputs and outcomes as these can be more quickly measured and communicated. If you need help in deciding what metrics are appropriate for your project that adhere to industry standards, check out Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS). IRIS IRIS is an initiative of the Global Impact Investing Network’s (GIIN), a non-profit dedicated to increasing the effectiveness of impact investments. Some of its most prominent members are: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefellar Foundation, and The MacArthur Foundation. IRIS is the go-to catalog for impact performance metrics so that impact investors can measure the social, financial, and environmental performance of initiatives. IRIS metrics are available for free. If you’re just starting out and want to incorporate some impact measurement metrics from the get-go, this is a good place to start to find the metrics that best describe your project. Global Impact Investment Ratings System (GIIRS) B Lab’s GIIRS system is more investor focused. While the reports include data points and analytics about a venture’s social impact, the goal of these metrics and data points are to create a standardized way for impact investors to compare the performances of various companies and funds. GIIRS is driven by IRIS and its ratings methodology is overseen by an independent Standards Advisory Council and subject to a rigorous audit process. Depending on the project, impact isn’t always so black and white. It takes time for certain projects to truly demonstrate their impact and this should be communicated to all stakeholders. If longer term studies are needed, allocate the appropriate resources or find partners to help. In the end, capturing and communicating the impact you’ve created might be just as important as the impact itself.","December 19, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tape-600x400.jpg"

Getting your head in the game after the festive season can be difficult with office Christmas parties, punsch at markets, and the general winding down of office activities through the month of December. We have some great tips, pulled from all over the internet, to help you readjust to office life after the festive season is over. Tidy Up Before You Go According to LifeHack, a great way to get back into the swing of things at the office is to tidy up before you go. Coming back to a messy desk can cause stress. Creating a clean and well-ordered workspace will make catching up easier when you arrive back in the office. Marie Kondo, the tidiness maven responsible for the book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying, says once you tidy up you “have the energy and motivation to create the life you want”. It is just a simple thing which could save you so much time and effort when you return from all the festivities. Make Lists Some of us are compulsive list makers. Some of us love the sight of a fully crossed off to-do list. Making a list of all your unfinished projects and where you are at in each of them will help you pick up the threads when you sit back in your office chair. People will have sent emails and called while you are at your Grandmother’s Silvester Party, going through your emails and phone messages and making a prioritized list when you return will help with some of the stress associated with getting back to the office according to LifeHack. One Thing at a Time Psychology Today reports that we are not as great at multi-tasking as we think. According to their article, The Myth of Multitasking, we lose precious seconds every time we switch from task to task, even it is listening to music while answering emails. According to their article you stop one task and move on to the next, even if it is only a ten second music clip and a single line email, we still need to stop and pick up again. This can cause stress, minute amounts but stress all the same. As LifeHack says “why stress yourself out if you can avoid it?” Leave the Office That’s right, we said it. And we said it for two reasons. The first, is to get you out of the office on time and the second is to get you to take a walk during the day. Work-life balance in the start-up ecosystem is hard enough to achieve but when you are coming back from vacation it can be harder. Set yourself a time limit and make sure you leave at that time. Making sure you have time to devote to family and yourself is essential to maintaining a healthy balance. Have we spoken lately about the benefits of walking? Trust us, they are myriad. According to Reader’s Digest, it can boost your mood, improve your creativity, help you remove that Christmas weight, sleep better, and reduce stress. Need more tips, check out our other guide on getting back in the office after the holidays.","December 20, 2018","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/getting-600x400.jpg"
"227","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/01/15/creating-collaborative-spaces-interview-daniel-utrilla/","ImpactHub","Creating Collaborative Spaces: An interview with Daniel Utrilla Mellinas"," Collaborative spaces are one of the most important aspects of modern work and they don’t just come out of nowhere. A lot of thought, planning, and design work goes into the desk you don’t even think twice to sit down at. Daniel Utrilla Mellinas is the Space Manager at Impact Hub Vienna. A designer through and through with a background in engineering, Daniel took the time to sit down and talk about how he approaches space design, how he ended up at Impact Hub Vienna, and what’s in the store for the future. What brought you to Impact Hub Vienna? Facebook. I saw an ad on Facebook that they were looking for a host. This was a little over 3 years ago. I initially came to Vienna on a grant to learn German. When I was finished, I was ready to head back to Spain. But then I found the Hub and it was exactly what I was looking for– a place where I fit in terms of creativity, innovation, and design in general. After a few months I was part of the Space and Infrastructure Circle. A few months later, I was Floor Manager and Space Curator, and about a year after that, I became Space Manager. What’s your creative process? How do you begin to see the possibilities of a space? Before I design anything, the most important thing I have to understand are the needs. I can’t design anything until I know what those needs are. Sometimes there’s a really good briefing but if not, I’ll conduct interviews and do research because I need to understand the problem to be solved. Once I’ve got that, I start brainstorming, sketching, and prototyping in order to come up with ideas to fulfill the needs that I’ve identified and then I’ll iterate until I get it right. Sometimes I’ll get to prototyping on a 1:1 scale. When it’s a space, I like to walk around and see what my ideas might look like in the actual space with wood, paper, or cardboard. Sometimes I realize it’s not working and go back to 1:100 scale and start again. Why do you think collaborative spaces are important? I think it’s important now and it’s become more important in the last few years because the way we work has evolved towards more collaboration. Obviously, it depends on what you do but generally, work requires more collaboration and if a space isn’t set up that way, it’s not a surprise if productivity or efficiency is low. Nowadays, it’s pretty common in a project for a variety of departments or circles to be involved such as social media, marketing, design, engineering; there’s so many inputs that are necessary. How do you create the opportunity or facilitate collaboration in a space? There’s no one rule so it depends on the organization and the requirements of the organization. It’s not just taking down walls and making everything open plan. If that’s not appropriate for a company, then it won’t work and you have to explore other options to enable collaboration in a space. It could be making a coffee area in the center of the building so everyone goes there to start conversations. You could put innovation cores in different areas so people connect there. But like I said, there’s no golden rule. You need to analyze the way people cooperate and collaborate. If collaborations are primarily online, the solutions may be different than if collaborations are mostly in person. What’s the most important element in creating a collaborative space? I think collaboration is really connected with emotions. I want to work with someone because I trust them. Creating this trust is very important and one of the most common things to start this process is coffee. Coffee connects people and having an area where people go to take a break allows people to have conversations which leads to connections and collaboration. Standing tables are also very interesting because it’s been shown that people feel more secure when they are talking while standing up. When you are sitting behind something or sitting down, you’re not as open as you are when you’re standing up. But ultimately, the most important element is to understand how a particular organization or space collaborates and go from there. What’s up next for the Impact Hub Vienna Space? How have the recent renovations affected collaboration? We have 3 floors now and we’ve noticed they’ve been operating independently and we’d like to change that. We want to create more connections between the floors and one thing we’ll be doing is having more co-working space on the 3rd floor. Other things we’re looking into is creating signs and objects that link the floors while also representing the Hub so when you look at these things, you know it’s Impact Hub. We’d also like to try and get people to move around between floors so if there’s an event, it’s on the Ground Floor. If it’s chatting and coffee, 1st Floor, or if you need a Silent Area, it’s on the 3rd Floor. We’ll try these things to see if they work. If not, we’ll iterate and try again.","January 15, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-22-at-5.30.50-PM-600x400.png"
"228","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/01/22/sustainable-development-goals/","ImpactHub","Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 101"," SDGs stand for the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted in 2015 and are key to the world achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity. The SDGs build on the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and address issues that need to be solved, such as poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), or improved, such as education (SDG4). It’s a call to action for every single country on the planet to focus their work on the goals which will make the world a better place. All told, there are 17 SDGs and each of them have many targets to achieve by 2030 at the latest. This sounds like a lot, but that just means there’s a lot of work to do. Every SDG comes with its own facts, figures, and targets so we’ve decided to pick out the most important things for each SDG to give you a broad overview. 1. No Poverty End Poverty in all its forms everywhere. It’s the 1st because it’s the most important. While poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, there are still around 783 million people who live under the international poverty line of US $1.90 a day. 2. Zero Hunger 1 in 9 people in the world (815 million people) are undernourished. Most live in developing countries. Poor nutrition causes almost half of all deaths of children under the age of 5. So how do we go about tackling this? We need to reevaluate how we grow, distribute, and consume food. 3. Good Health and Well-Being Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. One of the main goals of this SDG is to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. Another is to reduce premature deaths caused by incommunicable diseases by 1/3. This goal spans the fields of healthcare, hygiene and sanitation, and education. 4. Quality Education Over 265 million children are currently out of school. 22% are primary school age. So one of the main goals of SDG4 is to ensure that all children receive free quality primary and secondary education. 5. Gender Equality Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. While progress has been made in recent years, women and girls still suffer from discrimination and violence in every part of the world. Main targets are ending discrimination and violence against women, ensuring equal opportunities in political, economic, and public life, and the recognition of unpaid domestic work. 6. Clean Water and Sanitation Ensure access to water and sanitation for all. 3 in 10 people in the world lack access to safely managed drinking water and 6 in 10 people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. While solving these issues are a must, another target focuses on water-use efficiency across all sectors which is critical to this SDG. 7. Affordable and Clean Energy Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. 13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity. The goal is to get them onto the grid in an affordable, responsible, and sustainable way while giving everyone access to clean energy. 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. While the global unemployment rate has gone down, it’s not ensuring a path out of poverty for people in many places. Decent work opportunities continue to be lacking. The goal is to get people quality jobs that stimulate the economy in an environmentally friendly way. 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. The goal is to grow productivity and incomes which in turn will improve health and education. But, none of it is possible without good infrastructure in sectors such as transportation, communications, irrigation, and energy. 10. Reduced Inequalities Reduce inequality within countries and between countries. As much as there’s been a particular focus on economic growth in other SDGs, it’s not enough to reduce poverty if all the wealth goes to a few people. So the main goal is to grow the incomes of the bottom 40% at a rate that’s higher than the national average. 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Everyone is moving to a city and it’s projected 5 billion people will be living in a city by 2030 with most of the urban expansion happening in developing countries. With so many people piling into such small areas, this creates problems such as congestion, lots of waste, housing shortages, and pollution. Rapid urbanization is happening as we speak and it’ll require a lot of work to ensure that it’s done right while allowing cities to continue to thrive. 12. Responsible Consumption and Production Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. While many of the other SDGs might seem to be outside your sphere of influence, this SDG is something that you can tackle yourself. If you’re not a producer, you’re definitely a consumer because we all are. Start by reducing food waste and sorting your trash. 13. Climate Action Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It’s all about climate change and the goal is to get all countries to implement and act on climate change policies. 14. Life Below Water Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The oceans are being destroyed so the goal is to reduce pollution, manage and protect marine ecosystems, and end overfishing. Over 3 billion people rely on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihood and as their primary source of protein. 15. Life on Land Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss. We’re also destroying our land so it’s all about conservation, restoration, and the sustainable management and use of land and forests. 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies. Violence, human trafficking, corruption, bribery, tax evasion, and theft affect societies and communities everywhere. Strong institutions are needed to fight against these crimes to build more peaceful and inclusive societies. 17. Partnerships for the Goals Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. We all need to work together if any of this is going to work. This means partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society. We hope this overview was helpful!

In order to successfully grow a business, we need to move faster and with much greater effectiveness. We need access to data that allows our teams to learn, move and improve in real-time. The data needs to provide us with more signal in a sea of continuous noise. The data also needs to motivate and create momentum for those we lead. Where is this mysterious data set? And better yet, how do we integrate it for making decisions? There is something referred to as the heart center of the human can synthesize data and provide feedback to the brain. What is the heart center? According to the HeartMath Institute, the intelligence of the heart allows your body to evolve toward higher levels of order, awareness, and alignment with the other systems of the body, including the brain. “In the new field of neurocardiology, for example, scientists have discovered that the heart possesses its own intrinsic nervous system—a network of nerves so functionally sophisticated as to earn the description of a “heart brain.” Containing over 40,000 neurons, this “little brain” gives the heart the ability to independently sense, process information, make decisions, and even to demonstrate a type of learning and memory. Messages the heart sends to the brain also can affect performance”. – HeartMath Institute We also know “emotions are humanity’s motivator and its omnipresent guide.” – Dr. Thomas Lewis, A General Theory of Love This ‘emotional data’ is difficult to capture so we tend to ignore it or deem it invalid, especially in the workplace. We, at Kokoro, have a hypothesis – emotions drive performance. Emotions are the leading indicator of performance. And, importantly, emotions fuel business success. Let’s take a look at what science, research, and the latest trends have to say about high-performing teams and emotions. Amy Edmonton of Harvard looks at how psychological safety drives team performance This Harvard article reveals how psychological safety and diversity help to drive innovation and creativity The University of Sussex, looks at how identity and belonging to the team increases performance Here is an article on how workplace satisfaction drives productivity And one from Inc.com on how retaining talent is predicated on organizational mood and emotional connectedness High-quality emotions drive performance, so why don’t we use this valuable data to help our teams thrive? Well, they’re messy and difficult to integrate, making them easy to ignore. Most workplaces have very little if any emotional safety for their employees. Meaning people feel they cannot fully express themselves without the fear of consequence. When was the last time you were able to express yourself about the dirty dishes in the sink? Or when your boss told you to do something that didn’t align with your talents? So where do we start to integrate this more ‘emotional data’ that drives our teams? Listening and awareness are the first steps. Here are four easy tactics to start integrating emotions with your teams now: Listen – What wants to be said? What are the collective emotions saying? Surface – Where is the tension in the team? What wants to be surfaced? Process – How do we deal with those emotions? What will help us move forward? Adjust – How do we move and improve? The key is–keep it simple. Find quick and easy ways to build your emotional competence by tackling one thing at a time. I hope this helps you get started unlocking the true potential of your team and understanding how emotions fuel business success!

In 2018, the Greiner family decided to dedicate funds to giving back to society. To do this, they set up an accelerator program for impact entrepreneurs, and are now building a selective network of impact investors to bridge the gap between start-ups, know-how and funding. Each year the family will define a specific area it wants to focus on, based on the principles of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year the focus is on equal access to quality education and decent employment opportunities, to reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Set up in collaboration with Impact Hub Vienna, the program has now six impact entrepreneurs who have been carefully selected after presenting valid business concepts, and proof that their ideas have a measurable impact. The finalists get the opportunity to take part in a modular series of workshops and training in: Financial Skills Impact Measurement Sales and Marketing Strategy Between November 2018 and April 2019, each of the finalists, in addition, receive online expert and peer-to-peer support while taking part in these modules, ahead of the final pitching day in front of a selected pool of impact investors in Munich on April 11th.

Is it a co-working space? Is it a business accelerator? And why are there so many references to the Sustainable Development Goals hanging on the walls? The essence of Impact Hub and our community can be difficult to capture, as it is so many things. Impact Hub is an inspiring workspace where people come to catalyze new business ideas. It is a community where a serendipitous encounter at the coffee machine can lead to collaboration on a new project. It is a business accelerator where founders can get access to the experts and structured support they need to learn critical skills. But it’s also something a bit more intangible. Together with our member Zimt Film, we recently worked on a project to capture the vision and values of various members in the Impact Hub community. We interviewed the founders of Value App, Basenbox, Fitico, and more to find out about their experiences within the walls of Impact Hub. We also interviewed a few members of the Impact Hub Vienna team to share insights on the various ways Impact Hub connects the startup ecosystem in Vienna. We hope that the collective impressions of these interviews can help shed some light on both the tangible and intangible aspects of what Impact Hub Vienna is all about. Check out our full video and get to know a little more about our community. P.S. When we have to succinctly answer the question–what is Impact Hub? We often respond: Impact Hub Vienna is a diverse community of founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs who have one thing in common–we believe bold, entrepreneurial ideas can change the society for the better. At Impact Hub, people innovate with heart, balancing social responsibility with profitability to build a world that works for all. Get to know our community, our values, and our vision in our new video! We support the growth of socially impactful business ideas and technologies by hosting a vibrant community, an inspiring space, and customized accelerator programs.

March 8th is International Women’s Day, and across the globe we are celebrating the powerful women who are shaking the foundations of once patriarchal systems and societies to build a more gender-balanced world. This year, International Women’s Day is taking place under the banner of a new campaign, #BalanceForBetter, and we’re participating by highlighting a few of the women who inspire us. Some of these ladies are founders from within our own Impact Hub Vienna community, some are women who are internationally renowned for achievements in their field, and some simply have a powerful message we think is worth sharing. Enjoy these inspiring talks and help us celebrate women’s achievement on International Women’s Day (and every other day) by sharing this post with the hashtag #BalanceForBetter. Dr. Brené Brown, The Power of Vulnerability Being stoic is so 20th century. There is power in opening up to others, asking for help, and sharing experiences–both good and bad. Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor who has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and in this Ted Talk she shares what it really means to be brave in this world. Perrine Schober, Turning Weaknesses Into Strengths Perrine Schober is an Impact Hub Vienna member, and founder of SHADES TOURS, an organization that offers tours which shed light on topics like poverty, homelessness, refugees, and integration in Vienna. Her work has inspired people from all over the world to start similar projects in their own cities. In 2017, she gave an inspiring TED talk at TEDxTUWien about social entrepreneurship and what drives her to show up and push forward day in and day out, ignoring external pressures to pursue her own path. Isabel Allende, Tales of Passion Isabel Allende is a Chilean author and activist. She is often referred to as the world’s most widely read Spanish-language author, and many of her books highlight powerful stories in the lives of women. In this TED Talk, she discusses women, creativity, the definition of feminism, and passion. Cecile Richards, The Political Progress Women Have Made and What’s Next Cecile Richards is a U.S. American leader for women’s rights and author of the bestselling book Make Trouble. In this TED Talk, she challenges women to take part in a global political revolution for women’s equality, and gives some suggestions as to how we can make it happen.

"234","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/03/26/founder-spotlight-annamaria-tolvaly-bags-with-legs/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Annamaria Tolvaly, Bags with Legs","Annamaria Tolvaly came to Vienna from Romania, so her own life experience has taught her what it is to start life over in a new place. About a year ago, she opened an atelier and a shop Bags with Legs where she produces and sells exclusive bags. Her mission is to integrate women refugees in her project, providing them with income and a sense of belonging. Several months ago, she came to Impact Hub searching for help and advice and became one of the six participants in the found! accelerator program. How did you come up with the idea of making bags? “I believe that everything we do in the present is the accumulation of our past. I grew up in a family where making things with your hands and being creative was very important in order to survive. I grew up in communism, during a dictatorship. We did not have many things, and we had to create them. So what Bags with Legs does, is make amazing things with few resources. This is how this social project started. “It was very difficult at the beginning-I was unemployed, and I had no money. I started to make bags at home and began asking people how I could make it a sustainable business. But I needed to turn it into something more meaningful. I think that the world has a lot of bags – what it needs is change and inspiration. “I thought: «Ok… I see many women refugees who are trying to find their way, and they have this social stigma of being a migrant…» it’s an issue that speaks to me on a very personal level. I thought that maybe I should do something with them and for them. That is how I came up with idea of creating these handmade bags with the stories of women who came from these complicated places-places where they had to take their luggage along with them every day, out into the world to find a new life.” How did you meet your collaborators? Photo credit: Fernanda Nigro“I set up my shop and one day a woman came in and asked if she could help me. That’s how I met Momina, who is from Syria and was my first employee. Momina studied economics in her country and then worked in her family business. Five years ago she had to run away with her family and came to Vienna.” Momina recounted her story of meeting Annamaria, “Once I was walking near and I heard music coming from the shop and asked: Do you need some help? I told her about my experience, and then it turned out that [Annamaria] already knew about me from some people with who had participated in a workshop before. It was destiny!” “Correspondents from ORF TV came and interviewed Momina and I,” said Annamaria. “And then came the idea of a workshop, supported by AMS-I realized that I can share my knowledge with women refugees, as they are registered with AMS, and I can learn from them! For example, Momina has a great experience, and I learned many tricks from her. After Momina I trained Seda from Chechnya. She studied fashion. Refugees have amazing culture. The women — they know how to use their hands, they know how to sew, they cook amazing food. But then they have to come to a new country fit into a new system with different standards. It is a very difficult work and takes a lot of time.” From your experience and what you’ve learned from your employees, why do you think it’s so difficult to fit into a new system? First of all, because it’s personal, it is about PEOPLE. Refugees are people, and everybody has their own way of coping with a new situation. I don’t really like the word “integration” because it implies there is a uniform which you have to wear to be accepted. Actually, it’s about refugees finding their place here. I can do something about that. Even inviting a woman from Syria to have a coffee with me and to make a bag together—for me it’s already amazing. To start with something small. So my idea was to put these three values together: to work with my hands, to help women and to change perceptions. I really believe in it, it’s my philosophy. How has Impact Hub had an impact on your project? “My next thought was how to employ women refugees on a permanent basis. My aim is to hire at least one person by the end of this year, renovate the space and make my project financially sustainable. I want Momina to have a fixed place. The public institutions offer work on a project basis for several months. I want to hire refugees for a longer period of time. That’s why we need a help of business professionals. It was a bit difficult at the beginning, because I felt a bit insecure and thought I was being too idealistic, a “hippe” thinking I could change the world. Fortunately, I met other people at Impact Hub Vienna who feel the same way I do, and who I can learn from. You can move mountains with that. How has participating in the found! accelerator program, which is made in cooperation with the Deloitte Future Fund, impacted your business? Photo credit: Andreea Goldgrabber.“In November of the last year I contacted Impact Hub and was invited to participate in the found! accelerator program supported by Deloitte Austria. This project is really amazing. Thanks to it, more people can learn about my story and my plans. They can see us, see the women and the bags they make. During the program, I also receive a lot of training and participate in workshops. I now have two business mentors from Deloitte Austria who are helping us with business and marketing plans. With this, I can go to business institutions with a serious business plan and seek investment. Tell me about your brand name, Bags with Legs. “My bags are quite big, and when a woman goes with such a bag, it seems that her legs carry that bag.” Annamaria makes bags mainly from local materials including leather and waterproof fabric. She explains, “The line is very simple. For example, the bag can be made from «golden» fabric, but if the line is simple, it looks modern. And I have direct contact with my clients – if something is happening with the bag, I am keen to repair it. It’s a human guarantee.” Check out Bags with Legs products and learn more on their Facebook page.","March 26, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-9.13.35-AM-600x400.png"
"235","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/04/02/understanding-circular-economy/","ImpactHub","Understanding Circular Economy"," As the public calls for sweeping reform in how we as society produce and consumer goods, one clear answer emerges-building a circular economy. The circular economy is the conscious design and use of resources which allows for maximum sustainability, the antithesis of our current linear economy where we produce, buy, and dispose. The core principles of the circular economy revolve around reduction, reuse, and recycling. The way our current economies are structured is destroying the planet. We design products with planned obsolescence to encourage turnover. Think about fast fashion or even your phone–it’s not a coincidence that your clothes fall apart after a few washes and that you feel the need to upgrade your phone every year or two. Producers design things that won’t last, so you’ll purchase more. The circular economy wants to change all that. The idea is to design products and product life cycle systems which minimize and eliminate waste while allowing for the reuse and recycling of a product when it can no longer be used. For all you visual learners, here is a quick video to help explain: Back from the video? Good. Now, here are the principles of the circular economy. When producing new products (or buying products for that matter) products that contribute to a circular economy follow these principles. Biodegradable materials. It sounds like a no-brainer, but producers are not using as many biodegradable materials as they should. Circular economies build this core value into the manufacturing process ensuring that products at the end of their life cycles can return to the Earth in a safe and natural way. Renewable energy. It’s not just about the materials you use to manufacture products. The supply chain and manufacturing process should rely exclusively on renewable energy ensuring that the energy needed to produce a product does not hurt the environment and isn’t wasted. Reuse waste. If it isn’t biodegradable, it needs to be reused. It is critical in the circular economy that nothing is wasted and that non-biodegradable elements are reused in the next generation of products. Repair. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But if it is, then fix it. Things break down all the time but instead of throwing them immediately in the dump, we should fix them. Eco-design. This incorporates all the elements above. From day one, a product should be designed with a thorough consideration of its environmental impact pre-and post-life cycle. Rethink ownership. One of the main aspects of the circular economy is changing the structure of how we use durable products like washing machines and computers. Instead of being owners of our devices, we would lease, license, or share them and be users under the agreement that at the end of a product’s life, it will be returned and disassembled. Reusable parts would then be incorporated in the next generation of devices. Check out this diagram to see the principles of circular economy in action What’s next In order for the circular economy to succeed, it requires a substantial change in the way we do things. Manufacturers and consumers need to rethink their behavior for it to work. Producers need to recognize that resources should not be exploited but used responsibly. Consumers need to advocate and support products and systems that practice circular economy principles. For more information about the circular economy including case studies, check out the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.","April 2, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Untitled-design-12-600x330.png"
"236","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/04/15/founder-spotlight-karina-lackner-kicken-ohne-grenzen/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Karina Lackner, Kicken Ohne Grenzen","Today we have the pleasure to feature another participant of the found! 2019 accelerator program. The project «Job Goals» provides vocational training and coaching to young people, whose families were forced to emigrate to Austria. This initiative is created by a non-profit association «Kicken Ohne Grenzen», which has been engaged in helping children and young people develop soft skills through football training for the fourth year in a row. We talked with one of the founders of this organisation, Karina Lackner. WHY FOOTBALL? Karina Lackner: Together with my college Alois Gstöttner we started this project in 2015 when the refugee crisis happened. We wanted to offer some leisure time activities for young refugees, and we immediately thought about football because we had made some football projects before and we knew that football can have an impact on young people. We started to offer free football training. At that time we all had other jobs, for example, I worked as a software developer, so it was a voluntary project for us – we did not have any funding, any organisation. Very soon we started to offer football training for women as well. We realised that this kind of training can give much more than just some activity in the afternoon, that it is also a great tool for empowerment, for building self-esteem, especially for young women with a Muslim background. We started to build our project around this. In the first year, we were looking for donors who could allow us to use football fields for free, and we also used fields owned by the city council. It was a mixture of different solutions. In the beginning, it was quite easy because the goodwill and engagement of people were very high. However, as we started to grow and run the project on a more professional basis, it became more difficult for us. Right now we are renting football fields regularly and paying the rental fee because it gives more stability and you don’t depend on people who give it to you for free. It gives more sustainability. Copyright Sebastian Wahlhuetter HOW DOES FOOTBALL TRAINING HELP THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR ASSIMILATION IN AUSTRIA? Football game allows delivering soft skills in a very practical way. It is more than just feeling and being healthy. We developed a concept of training, which includes decision making, conflict management, leadership, and also skills young people could use for employability. But still, it was a normal football training – for example, exercising and games with certain rules, based on decision making. And afterwards, people had the possibility to reflect on what they did, to talk about how to develop and use these skills in daily life. After 3 years], we became more experienced and also, together with a dozen other partners in the same field, we became part of an EU association for football for development. We are networking and creating exercises and collecting tools kits together. In our team, there are 25 people, including employees and volunteers – teachers, social workers and coaches. HOW DO YOU FINANCE YOUR ACTIVITIES? We have been lucky because we have got support from FIFA Foundation and also from SOL Foundation, which is specialising in sports for development. Recently we have got a positive response for a grant from UEFA Foundation for Children. These three foundations are founding the base program. Of course, we applied and have gotten some help from the City Council, and we also get private donations. CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR BENEFICIARIES? Now we have 120 beneficiaries across four teams, which means four weekly evening sessions. Two male teams, one group of young women and one kids team, with the children between eight and fourteen years old. Most of them have a migrational background. The first big group were young refugees, but now the teams are more open, more mixed, so we have young kids from different kinds of underprivileged communities. The teams are open to everybody, and we also have Austrians, who were interested in involving themselves in the project – it’s a great advantage for the other participants. Most of the kids who come to us are lost somehow and dropped out of the system. Some of them finished school or have never even been to school, and they are in some parallel culture where they just don’t know what to do. In the beginning, they don’t realise that they get so much more outcome than just running around with a ball by participating in our project. Copyright Petra RautenstrauchHOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO JOIN YOUR TEAMS? Actually, it works on a personal level. People bring friends and relatives – brothers, sisters, daughters, cousins. We also cooperate with charity organisations, for example with Caritas. So we never experienced the need to be active in searching for participants. Our doors are open, and in the beginning young people come to us just to play football, and in the process, we integrate them in our other educational offers, and also in the projects of the City, which sometimes cannot them reach so easily. A lot of women, who play in our teams can be with their friends, organize workshops or go for vocational job training – now we have all these additional educational programs. WHAT IS THE «JOB GOALS» PROJECT? As part of the found! accelerator program at Impact Hub, we developed a project called «Job Goals». It is aimed at young people between the ages of 16-24 who were participating in our football trainings for a while and are already empowered to have professional experience and who also have already a good level of German. They get a CV and job coaching: specialists from Deloitte give them pieces of advice on the interests they have and on what would be good for them to do. And then we connect them to companies, which give them vocational job trainings. All this started last year without any funding, it was a pure experiment. Until now, 15 young people have had a possibility to do it, and at the Impact Hub Vienna, we are developing a project, which would be more sustainable and would have a bigger scale and also funding, of course. We invite partners from companies, which support us or who would like to involve their employees as corporative volunteers. But it is still very connected to football because these are the people who were reached through football and who developed their skills through football. We know them – we have been with them for 3 years, we know their personalities, and the relationships are much deeper than for example, relationships they have built in AMS. Copyright Sebastian WahlhuetteAT WHAT STAGE IS THE «JOB GOALS» PROJECT NOW? For example, someone has a retail business and tells us: I need a young worker with good communication skills. And we think of who we have with these skills in our group and who would be interested in such work experience. So we connect them and they organize job training days. This is already happening. But the goal we are developing with Impact Hub is that every member of our teams could participate in this project. We want to have it more structured so that every week there are such trainings available. We want to establish a permanent course and the goals which the participants have to reach in order to finish the program with success and to become competitive on a labour market. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO INVEST YOUR BUDGET INTO NEXT? We will need 2-3 permanent employees for this project, and a part of this money would be spent on specific football trainings, because we still want to develop the life skills during this program. And we also want very much to involve some big companies in our project through the found! accelerator program. We have sponsors’ packages developed together with our Deloitte mentors. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT WIN THE FUNDING THROUGH found! ACCELERATOR? We have already started this project, it was not something invented specifically for this accelerator programme, so we will keep doing it anyway. Of course, we would like to have more resources. But we will try to find the money somewhere else. WHAT CHALLENGES DOES YOUR PROJECT FACE RIGHT NOW? The political situation is very difficult for us. Sports ministry was funding us but with the arrival of the new government, they cut the funding. That’s why we realised that our funding strategy should not be so dependent on the internal political situation and that we should look for international funding opportunities. And another problem is that women’s football in Austria is very underrepresented. Many people think: It’s a nice hobby, but you don’t need any money for it, just play football. But in fact, football is a really powerful tool for development.

In 1930, John Maynard Keynes believed we would be working 15-hour weeks. Fast forward to the present, technology has advanced in ways few of us could’ve imagined. A computer has shrunk from the size of an entire room to the size of a human hand. And yet, most of us are working more than ever before. Technology has given work the ability to creep into our home life. But is it just an issue caused by the rise of technology? Or are we causing ourselves this mental strife? Some estimates say that over half of workers are burning out. The 15-hour week still seems a long way off so until it happens, let’s look at ways we can find a work-life balance and keep our sanity in check. Say no This is not the easiest thing to do and may not even be possible for most workers. But sometimes, you need to be the one to push back against your boss and tell them no to a project you know is going to eat more of your time. Sometimes, this ‘no’ is you saying it to yourself. Hard work does pay off in the long-run but at what cost? Ambition won’t get you anywhere if you burn out too fast. Life isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon. So pace yourself. And know that there are no shortcuts. Assess where you are right now Be realistic with what you can achieve. We all want to change the world for the better but if you don’t achieve it this second, the world’s not going to end. We all have deadlines to meet, meetings to attend, and KPIs to achieve. But if the stress is getting to you, try to step back and take an objective view. What’s the worst thing that can happen if you miss a deadline? And what is that worth to you? Are you just your job? With the continual fading of barriers between work and life, it’s easy for many people to make work their entire life and derive almost all of their value from it. But think about that for a second, are you just your job? Take some time to think about where that line between your work and your life should be. Look at the other parts of your life where you find value like your friends or sports. Reorganizing where you get value will also reorganize the importance you put on work. Start small You will probably need to restructure some aspects of your life. Whether it’s making more time for your friends and family or just making time for yourself. A complete overhaul is probably not going to be possible unless it’s absolutely necessary. So start small and make gradual changes. If you eat lunch at your desk to get more work done, that’s exactly the place to start. Exercise and meditate Exercise has been proven to be an effective relief for stress. Like the point above, start small. Go for a walk. Take 5 minutes and then make it 10. Pretty soon you’ll be in the swing of things and jogging for 30 minutes will be the norm. Meditation has also been shown to relieve stress. Taking as little as 10 minutes to center yourself and be mindful of how you’re feeling can do wonders. It might also reveal the next steps you need to take for the proper work-life balance. The way forward There are greater things in this world than work. While it gives many of us purpose, it can also grind us down. The points above are just guidelines. Since everyone’s different, you need to find what works for you. But the first step is always recognizing your needs. So start there. ","April 16, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adult-bright-cacti-306533-600x400.jpg"

He even wrote in his diary that “music is a stenograph of feelings” and committed long hours pondering the effect music has on human emotions. It’s difficult not to consider the very same sentence when one witnesses one of the spontaneous piano concerts in the city made possible by Open Piano for Refugees. Open Piano for Refugees, run in cooperation with the social music institute DoReMi where refugees are employed as music instructors, is one of the ventures participating in the found! 2019 accelerator program. The initiative places pianos in open public spaces to invite integration through music, strengthening the social participation of refugees and social cohesion. We spoke to one of the people behind this musical initiative – Lena Parzer. What inspired you to create an initiative that supports refugee assimilation? We wanted to inspire the public to enter into an exchange with each other, to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, and to give the refugees an opportunity to present themselves positively – through the path of music. Why piano? A piano stands out – it not only looks good but also reaches an unbelievable number of people acoustically. And that is, after all, the goal – to inspire as many people as possible with it. The piano functions not only as a musical instrument but also as an integration instrument. A piano offers the possibility to play it together, but also to play it together with other instruments or to accompany a choir or vocals. Photo courtesy of Open Piano for Refugees How did you create the network of partners you have today? Our motto is: Whoever asks wins. We presented our project to our current partners and everyone was enthusiastic about the idea right from the start. In the meantime, people know us, either because they have already passed an open piano and experienced the magic and dynamics of the project for themselves, or because they have heard of us from friends or through the media. We ourselves all have a connection to music and know musicians, who in turn introduce us to new people from the music scene. The big popularity results from word of mouth. What have been your biggest milestones so far? We could open our social music school DoReMi in March last year and can already teach 160 students in the 3rd semester on a “pay as much as you can” basis. Socially disadvantaged persons (with and without migration background) learn how to play an instrument together with another person, who is higher in income. We started with only 20 pupils, so this is a really big increase and shows us that there is a big necessity. Our students are all super motivated, as are our teachers, which leads us to expand this music school even further – we plan to be in other cities and even countries. Photo courtesy of Open Piano for Refugees What are the biggest challenges you have encountered? When founding an association, there are several bureaucratic things to consider. One has to deal with the requirements that such a foundation entails and then deal with employment etc.. However, there is no challenge in itself that cannot be mastered – we have many talented and skilful people around our core team who stand by us in the most diverse matters, should we not be able to cover them ourselves. What are the logistics of organising Open Piano for Refugees? First of all, we have to organise the location itself – we have to contact the shopping centres in the winter season and the public authorities in the summer season, to get permission to play in the streets. Then there is a grand piano to organize and in consequence the piano transport. And of course, we need a piano supervisor for each location to ensure that everything runs smoothly. How is found! supporting you? How are you utilising the programme? The people who support us at found! all come from the professional field – there is an incredible amount of input and very helpful ideas. We are currently working on the definition of the task packages, we are working on our organizational structure. In addition, we are currently setting up some marketing strategies, with the mentors of found! actively supporting us. Photo by Johanna Leitner The best moment of the program so far was… To get to know all the other great participants and initiators of the projects and to see how much time and motivation these people put into their startups to make the world a bit better! What’s next for Open Piano for Refugees? We are in the process of organizing the summer locations, from May on we will be hosting our Open Piano almost every weekend in a different city in Austria and Germany. The ‘We are Vienna Festival’ in June is also just around the corner, where we will be standing with our grand piano in every district for 23 days. And in the long run, the expansion of our music institute is on the agenda – we will not only leave it at Vienna <U+0001F609> Find out more about Open Piano for Refugees on their website, or follow them on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram.","May 13, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Piano-for-Refugees-Impact-Hub-Interview-1140x407-600x400.png"

RE:WIEN supports start-ups and ventures which are based in Vienna and have developed an innovative product or service with great market potential. The areas in which the ventures operate are broad: from the circular economy, local value chain, concepts for cooling and greening the city, food waste to ecodesign. Running for the 5th time in co-operation with Oeko Business Wien, the 2019 batch will go through an intense 6-month process to develop their ideas further, establish smart and resource-efficient processes and build strong and sustainable businesses operating on the market. RE:WIEN 2019 cohort’s selection aligned with the global agenda Today, programs like RE:WIEN are more important than ever – with School strike for climate still fresh in the news, the EU Commission has recently adopted its 4th Circular Economy Package, including an implementation report covering the full Circular Economy Action Plan and the United Nations is calling for a more effective strategy of putting the global economies on course to implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. „OekoBusiness Vienna has 20 years of history in helping Viennese enterprises generate “green and clean” profits through ecological management practices that benefit both the environment and the enterprises,” commented Bertram Häupler, Program Management at OekoBusiness Vienna. “With the RE:WIEN Program together with our competent partners at Impact Hub Vienna we want to share this experience with founders and start-ups so that their products and services will soon be a part of a sustainable entrepreneurship network in Vienna.“ “Vienna is continuously building up its reputation of the most liveable city in the world but it has also been excelling in the areas of recycling, waste management, social impact innovation and recently also in the areas of tech for good. But there’s still more to be done and we are excited to help more founders to realise their ideas of making Vienna a better place to live,” added Ioana Constantin, Acceleration Unit Lead at Impact Hub Vienna Not surprisingly, the ventures for this year’s incubation track with Oeko Business Wien are addressing the circular economy, moving beyond single-use plastic, social involvement as well as sustainable local food. Meet the finalists! Alpengummi is producing the first natural chewing gum of the Alps. While conventional chewing gums are made of petrochemicals (plastics), the gum base of Alpengummi is made of tree resin and beeswax. BauKarussell – Urban Mining provides recovery-oriented demolition with a particular focus on reuse for large-volume properties, enabling new regulations to be met. In cooperation with large Viennese property developers, reusable components are dismantled and made available for reuse. Hempstatic specializes in the circular design of building units. They develop recyclable materials from agro-byproducts and aspire to revitalize the regional economy with their regenerative approach. Their pilot product line is dedicated to eco soundproofing systems. Lenkerbande provides all kinds of bike related services beyond the service lines of regular bike shops. They fix, recycle and donate used bicycles in do-it-yourself workshops in Vienna, thus making sustainable mobility available to everyone. NASCH Sportswear is a sports brand for everyone with a sustainable and individual offer. They design jackets, which are compatible with three different sports thanks to changes in the cut design and fabric selection. All products can be recycled and reused supporting the circular economy. Paradeisa – Der Online Hofladen offers the best from the farm shops in the area. Fresh, natural, and environmentally friendly, this venture helps to limit transport, storage and packaging involved in the traditional retail distribution of local produce while promoting fair pricing and food waste prevention. RePhil revolutionizes traditional takeaway by providing a circular system for reusable food containers to reduce waste stemming from single-use take away boxes while offering a convenient solution for customers. Supplying restaurants with reusable boxes, as well as managing the logistical distribution and the washing process are part of RePhil’s daily operations. Social Held is a digital platform connecting nonprofit organisations with people and businesses motivated to get socially involved. Follow their journey Make sure to follow Impact Hub Vienna on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and/or Instagram to stay up to date with RE:WIEN ventures. The program will run until the 26th of September.","May 14, 2019","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/REWien-Group-Photo-2019-600x400.jpg"
"240","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/05/20/challenge-yourself-grow-the-experience-of-a-european-volunteer/","ImpactHub","Challenge yourself & grow: The experience of a European volunteer","For you personally, what does the Erasmus+ volunteering service stand for and why did you decide to do this type of volunteering? Alexandra Pediakova: For me, European Voluntary Service (EVS) is an opportunity to live in a different country, to be involved in activities I wouldn’t be otherwise, and to get to know great people. In addition, it’s a chance to interact with new cultural and ideological bubbles (and learn how to say bubble in different languages, like Romanian). I worked as a volunteer before in different organizations, so the idea of volunteering was nothing new to me. Nikola Simcuvova: EVS is an opportunity for young people to come into contact with different cultures and languages while acquiring new skills and valuable international experience. It’s also a great experience to be able to work on meaningful projects supporting the development of local communities. I decided to relocate to Vienna and do the EVS at Impact Hub Vienna because I was eager to try something new and curious to get to know the social business and startup scenes. Why did you choose Impact Hub Vienna and what were your tasks as a volunteer? Alexandra: I knew Impact Hub already from their location in Brno, Czech Republic and thought it was a cool place to spend my time. I wanted something meaningful, and somewhere I could practice my German language skills, so I decided to apply for the EVS in Impact Hub Vienna. At the beginning, I started as a host. It was the right job to get to know what Impact Hub is and meet different members of the community. Later during the program, I became involved as an Event Coordinator. This position helped me to be part of many diverse events. Nikola: I was pretty familiar with the global network of Impact Hubs, but I have never been a part of one before. I found it fascinating how business and social spheres could be combined and how Impact Hubs support startups via different accelerator programs, workshops, mentoring, community connections, etc. As a volunteer, I was a part of the Community team and had multiple roles which enabled me to try basically anything I wanted to. I organized community events, coordinated volunteers, administered social media and other online marketing platforms, facilitated connections between members and co-organized CEE Impact Day 2018 which is the largest social impact conference in Central & Eastern Europe. Looking back at the last year, what was your personal highlight of your European Voluntary Service? Alexandra: My personal highlights were the people I met and the atmosphere of Impact Hub. For me, it was important to meet people who care about the earth, other people spread a positive attitude and good vibes.Nikola: My biggest highlight of the whole EVS experience was the community. I met plenty of like-minded people and was constantly inspired by their personalities, stories, and accomplishments. The community is very unique in the way everyone supports each other, shares the same values and works hard towards the same goal is. It is, in my opinion, the core of the whole organization. From my personal perspective, I enjoying experiencing a significant amount of personal growth. I realized that I can basically do anything, even though things might have seemed impossible at the first, I always managed to navigate my way through difficult projects and tasks. I trust my skills and abilities much more now than ever before. What societal challenges in Slovakia do you think social entrepreneurship can help to address? Alexandra: There are big gaps in the educational system in Slovakia that social entrepreneurship can help (and has already started to help) address. In particular, I am referring to the Roma minority, challenges around integration and social inclusion. Of course, there are many other societal challenges that we have in Slovakia, such as health and well-being. Nikola: Compared to Austria or other EU countries, Slovakia has a low awareness and understanding of the concept of social entrepreneurship, and the infrastructure supporting social enterprises is very limited. In spite of that, I see plenty of opportunities to address societal challenges through social entrepreneurship. For example, challenges like the aging of the population, high unemployment in many regions of the country, as well as significant Roma community, are things that can be improved upon by the creation of social businesses. How would you finish the sentence “For me Impact is…” Alexandra: …thinking about the world I am living in and acting as a part of a community. Nikola: Making a positive difference, spreading good, leaving a mark. If you could recommend one thing to the next volunteer who comes to Impact Hub Vienna what would it be? Alexandra: Just do what gives you joy and don’t be afraid to ask for advice or help <U+0001F642> Nikola: Challenge yourself! Learn more about Erasmus+ here.

At Impact Hub Vienna, we host events on an almost daily basis, and for us, it’s really important to consider how we can make our events environmentally friendly. The question of how to make a positive environmental impact is also related to the events we host and the catering companies we work with every day. Even the smallest thing can make a difference. So how do we minimize our impact on the world with our events? Go local Our catering is provided by local firms which use organic, seasonal, and locally grown produce. Event goers will see that apple pies are in full swing in the fall, asparagus dishes can be found in abundance in spring, and there are no strawberry desserts for Christmas! Snacks and beverages provided for coffee breaks are also locally produced and we buy them in bulk so that we reduce CO2 emissions caused by the back and forth transport of food. For everything else that we need to make our guests happy and productive, we buy from the stores in our neighborhood to support local businesses. Also Rita Bringt’s, one of our caterers, brings food by bike, which also reduces our carbon footprint, and uses palm leaf plates that are biodegradable. Reduce plastic Plastic and package reduction is one of the biggest challenges we face. We are constantly trying to improve and think about how we can reduce that waste. We don’t use plastic dishes, cutlery, or cups we use napkins from 100% recycled materials and are always looking for ways to reduce the use of packaging of food and drinks. We buy our drinks in refillable glass bottles and our caterers bring food in reusable glass jars in order to reduce plastic packaging. We also have recycling bins in the event spaces to encourage our guests to properly dispose of their waste. Reduce food waste Food waste is an important and ever-present issue with events. We are very careful to order portions according to the number of event attendees. If there is food left over after an event, we usually offer it to our community. Also, the catering firms we work with often have their own solutions to preventing food waste from their services. Companies such as iss mich bring larger amounts of leftovers back to their kitchen or distribute it in town via foodsharing, which are the public fridges that are accessible to everyone. During the month of May, we collaborated with one of our ventures, Süd & Satz, to collect coffee residue in a special waste bin, which is then used as soil for growing mushrooms. Reduce meat consumption This topic is still a bit controversial, but we encourage our clients to opt for vegetarian and vegan-only catering. Of course, we have to meet all client needs but we always educate our clients about some of the amazing veggie catering options they have, and they are usually happy to use them. We’ve built a big network of catering suppliers that are vegetarian and vegan only, so there is a lot to choose from. If we still need to offer meat dishes, our suppliers use organic, and locally grown meat. Hosting sustainable events requires a little bit more planning, research and thought, but in the long run, once the foundation is there, it is easier to organize environmentally friendly events and reduce our footprint on our planet!

"242","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/06/11/storytelling-for-social-entrepreneurs/","ImpactHub","Storytelling for social entrepreneurs","Recently, Davorin Barudzija, an integrative trainer, coach, and recruitment manager at Teach for Austria hosted an eye-opening skillshare breakfast about storytelling at the Hub. He drew upon his years of experience in adult vocational training to activate the innate storytelling abilities of all the attendees. Ever find yourself trying to tell an important story but tripping over the words? Things that were meant to be told at the end somehow find themselves in the beginning and the beginning all of sudden becomes the middle and before you know it, the story’s backward and forward at the same time and your audience is lost. Storytelling goes beyond one-to-one communication. Every startup has their story to charm potential investors, partners, and employees. If you’re a social entrepreneur, you have your story and nobody can tell but you. If you’re looking to inspire others to follow your lead, here are four tips to take your storytelling to the next level. Make it personal The more honest you are, the easier it will be to tell your story and the more likely a listener will be moved and connect with your story. Activate your listener’s empathy. We’re all different but we’ve experienced the same emotions. We’ve all been happy, sad, and somewhere in between. Build the bridge to your audience by opening yourself up. It might be scary at first to be vulnerable, but that’s how you connect with other people. Paint a picture Activate a listener’s senses. Where were you? What did it look like? What did it smell like? How did you feel? Painting a picture orients the listener and draws them into your story. They begin to see things the way you see them and feel closer to you. Have you heard the saying: “walk a mile in (someone’s) shoes?” Using descriptive language helps your audience to go for a walk in your shoes. Pause You’ve probably seen it in every TED talk: the dramatic pause. Notice how you probably leaned in to hear more, eager for the next words from the speaker. You should do that too. Why? Because it works. It allows the story you’re telling to settle in the minds of your listeners and builds anticipation to what’s coming next. You probably have a natural instinct to cover every bit of silence thinking that the audience is going to be bored if you stop talking. It’s actually the opposite. So take your time and remember to breathe at the right spots. Use silence to your advantage. Practice, practice, practice You won’t tell your story right the 1st time, or the 5th time, or even the 10th time. But every time you do, you’ll improve it in small increments. You’ll take all the cues and feedback from every listener and hone in on what works. So what are you waiting for? Go out and tell your story. Tell it to your friend or someone at the Hub. The most important thing is that you tell your story because nobody can tell it but you.

Often referred to as the backbone of the European economy, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a focal point in shaping enterprise policy in the European Union. In 2015, SMEs represented 99 % of all enterprises in the EU! While social innovation has become an established movement around the world, it has not yet managed to sufficiently penetrate the ranks of SMEs, the sector most relevant for furthering the development goals of the social innovation agenda. The Social Challenges Innovation Platform encourages sustainable, marketable innovations with clear social benefits by matching “Challenge Owners” – organisations with problems to solve – with creative entrepreneurs and social innovators. In a nutshell, SCHIP has created a matchmaking platform where social needs meet sustainable and innovative solutions, which you can visit under socialchallenges.eu. “As the City of Vienna and the environmental department is working towards a sustainable future for its citizens as well as companies, SMEs and start-ups, it is important for us to also have the right tools for their participation. The SHIP project was a perfect „playground“ for trying out an innovative online participation tool as a pilot project for further decisions and developments‘, commented Bertram Häupler from OekoBusiness Wien, one of the Challenge Owners. The Platform is powered by Meta Group, EBN and Impact Hub, under the management of the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME) and with the support of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme. Where a challenge is transformed into a new business opportunity When SCHIP launched in 2016, the objectives of the project were not only to create awareness and facilitate the interaction among a wide range of stakeholders relevant for the platform but also to identify high-impact social challenges Europe is facing today and kick-start a collaboration between SMEs and social innovators to address these challenges. Part of the SCHIP efforts is to provide financial support through grants in the amount of €30k each and six months’ worth of training and mentoring to help translate social innovators’ pitches into practical, marketable solutions. Today we are checking in with five social innovators who submitted their pitches to the SCHIP platform and who were selected to make their ideas a reality. Unverschwendet The challenge: Make conscious consumption mainstream in Vienna. Farmers are forced to produce up to 200% of the amount of fruit needed to ensure that enough of them meet the excessive market norms. The highly specialized requirements of supermarkets for shape, colour and size of fruits lead to a surplus of up to 500 kg per day for one small farm. In most cases, these surplus fruits are thrown away. Unverschwendet turns excess fruits and vegetables into delicious products such as jam, syrup, chutneys, pickles, sweets, ketchup, sauces and more. This culinary solution is a tool in the fight against food waste! In the long-term, Unverschwendet wanted to offer various large scale solutions for preventing waste of surplus food. The social enterprise is run by siblings, Cornelia and Andreas Diesenreiter, who are supported by a great team and partners. Some SCHIP Milestones: With SCHIP’s help, through their research and networking, Unverschwendet built partnerships with three well-established food producers who will help them to scale their production over the next three years. Unverschwendet won both start-up programs from the two biggest food retailers in Austria for nationwide listing and they are currently in the final stage of negotiations. Together with WWF Austria Unverschwendet launched an online campaign on food waste in order to inform people on the Food Overshoot Day. erdbeerewoche The challenge: Make conscious consumption mainstream in Vienna. erdbeerwoche is an innovative e-commerce platform that is both an awareness-raising tool as well as an online shop for sustainable feminine hygiene products. erdbeerwoche decided to create an extension to their offering – an e-learning platform for teenagers that educate boys and girls between 13 and 16 years about the topic of menstruation and sustainable feminine hygiene. With the prototype of an e-learning platform for teenagers “Ready for Red”, erdbeerwoche are the first to provide a holistic learning experience about menstruation and sustainable feminine hygiene by providing unique content in a way that teenagers like to learn: interactive, funny and with a lot of videos and games. Some SCHIP Milestones: erdbeerwoche approached more than 200 schools in Vienna and established successful collaborations such as the collaboration with the City of Vienna. erdbeerwoche developed a webinar series to train teachers on how to use “Ready for Red” in classes. The “Ready for Red” team trained 140 teachers in nine one- hour webinar sessions. One of the most valuable outcomes of SCHIP was that erdbeerwoche had the chance to test the prototype of “Ready for Red” and develop a business model that provides longterm sustainability and represents a completely new income stream for erdbeerwoche. “Ready for Red” won the Next award and has been nominated for the “Get active social business award” (October 2018). Wohnbuddy.com (by WGE!-Gemeinsam Wohnen) The challenge: Fight marginalization in Vienna. WGE is a social enterprise that matches the elderly and retirement homes via the wohnbuddy.com platform with suitable buddies for co-living. These co-living buddies are mostly young people, who provide time for common activities as well as everyday support for a low-cost room. WGE! developed a prototype of a new online platform called wohnbuddy.com to improve the matching process and vacancy management, enabling the company to increase its impact and to scale the business to other European cities. Some SCHIP Milestones: WGE! Met their initial objective, the development of a prototype of an online platform, at the end of March 2019. WGE! Was invited to participate in a panel discussion about “The Future of Living” organized by the Viennese People’s Party. WGE! met a lot of stakeholders and could acquire two new partnerships with well-established organizations from the area of Social Services in Austria through SCHIP. Kuorum The challenge: fight marginalization in Vienna. The City of Vienna is committed to reducing inequality, but the political misrepresentation of immigrants can lead to marginalization and social conflicts. The Integration and Diversity Unit of the city council of Vienna can benefit from implementing novel means of civic participation. But it is equally important to be able to measure the impact of those innovative solutions in order to monitor their achievements. Kuorum is a technology consultancy firm that provides solutions to support collaborative problem solving and citizen engagement. Kuorum’s technology – aimed at local governments, corporations and organizations – is free and the only charges applied are for customizations and ad hoc software development. Their submitted pitch was for an idea centred around fostering the diverse civic engagement through training and online debates among local politicians and young immigrants. Some SCHIP Milestones: The Engagement Platform was translated to German and launched in July. There was a severe delay in the selection of the training partner, which caused the training to start in January instead of September. After the initial training session, the youngsters started to participate in the platform. In March the youngsters met again with the training partner in order to work further on their proposals. Finally, some of the youngsters will present their proposals in front of district elected officials. Kuorum collected all the information from the training partner to produce a final report. Lesson learned: Without involving someone in the city council who is responsible for citizen engagement, dissemination is hard, as Kuorum didn’t have permission to use the official channels and logos. SHADES TOURS The challenge: fight marginalization in Vienna. SHADES TOURS organizes alternative tours and activities in Vienna on socially polarizing topics. The difference in comparison to regular tours is that the tours are guided by affected persons themselves and therefore provide a different perspective on the city. SHADES TOURS showed a proof of concept in 2016-2018 and began developing new ways to integrate marginalized groups back into society and back into the labour market. Their SCHIP proposal was to create a new product, “Tours Guided by Refugees”, and start working on the upcoming tour product on the topic of Drugs & Addictions. Some SCHIP Milestones: SHADES TOURS conducted focus groups and a survey with employees of different Viennese companies and another survey with social institutions. The employee survey delivered the prerequisites of Social Team Building activities, whereby the survey to the institutions provided a clearer picture of their needs. The newly developed tours and presentations were able to sell to 1,149 participants on the topic of refugees & integration. SHADES TOURS found a mentor Andreas Heinecke – founder of Dialogue in the Dark, who will help them develop the required legal and structural documents for the Social Franchise.

Not to mention starting a new business! The founders of KulturenReich know exactly how it feels. KulturenReich is a social enterprise built by foreign-born women, who, having faced the challenges of being new in Vienna, help other foreign-born women through their supportive community and an entrepreneurship academy focused on business skills. We spoke to Amarilla Nirmala, KulturenReich’s own Chief Marketing Whizz, about their idea, plans and their participation in the found! 2019 accelerator program. What inspired you to launch KulturenReich? KulturenReich started when Tila (Asetila Köstinger), who was a total stranger at that time, reached us through a Facebook group, asking about voluntarily activity for a social initiative. We first met in January 2018, all foreign-born Viennese ourselves. We, although never met before, talked about the struggles and challenges we had upon arriving in this beautiful city. We all have our own personal stories and realised how similar they were. We realized that complaining and whining won’t solve any problems, and this should be a mindset of all foreign-born and migrant women. Hence, we decided to take the matter into our hands, to help other ladies, who have similar struggles. KulturenReich isn’t only based on personal experience, but also through surveys and validation in foreign-born, expat, and migrant communities. They have experienced some bumps to start their professional lives again in Austria. Learning curve and uncertainty are real. So we launched KulturenReich as a way to support each other because we believe international talents with so much cultural understanding is one of the strong pillars in today’s economy. How does KulturenReich work? We support women through entrepreneurship academy, a supportive group and on-job training. We provide know-how tools about business, mainly minor, startup, and small businesses initiatives. Plus we are currently preparing our on-job training scheme, dedicated to bridge the CV gap and introduce the ladies to the Viennese work environment. Photo © Tamás KünsztlerAs foreign women in Vienna, how did you find the business registration process to be? Vienna offers many channels of support through the government, however, foreign-born women and migrants are often afraid to use these services or speak up. Often times the information is misunderstood. That’s why KulturenReich, since March 2019, is in an official agreement with Vienna Business Agency, and currently, they support our events, and workshops in a specific topic in terms of setting up a business. We would like to be more present and have more collaborative partners, so we can help more foreign-born and migrant women to get clarity and guide them in their entrepreneurial journey. From us, they will get a supportive group and know-how tools, and from respective partners, they will get thorough regulatory information. What stage is your startup at right now? We officially started in January 2018, we launched at the EXPAT Centre with support from Vienna Business Agency in June and officially registered as an association (Verein) in the same month. We provide our services and are currently focusing on revenue stream and sustainability. We are strengthening our community, and progressing to our fourth academy namely We DO Academy in Autumn 2019. What has been the response to your initiative? I think such an initiative is very much needed. When you move to a new country, there are many things to learn and absorb and often times it is too much. Foreign-born and migrant women need a supportive group where they can build each other and reach the top together. We have been growing our community to nearly 600 people organically, and with 30-80 people actively coming to our events. We would like to increase the number of participants at our academy, and as a community, we aim to double size this year. It is a warm feeling when people mention that they like our initiative. We are friends with the ladies, who use our services, not only as members but as a big family because we believe in cooperation. Which of the training programs you offer is the most popular? Pitching preparation, business model canvas, and marketing are three subjects that are most attractive. And as we are in collaboration with the Vienna Business Agency, the basic information about setting up a business is always interesting. What do you see as the main challenges foreign women face in Austria? The biggest ones are the language and network. What are the three most important skills would you say women entering the workforce in Austria should focus on improving? Networking, language, and to know your niche. Which part of found! program has been the most helpful? The Deloitte mentors with whom we have had a great time. We were able to get very much needed support from them, such as the preparation of a financial plan. Also, the workshop with startups during which we got valuable insights from other social entrepreneurs. Why do you think accelerator programs such as found! are important to start-ups? As Marieke Pluk, Impact Hub Program Manager responsible for found!, said, social entrepreneurs cannot work alone, we need partners and we need support. found! has been a great help for us because it increases our visibility not only as a social business but also it brings awareness that problems faced by our niche aren’t exclusive. This is a challenge, we as a community, -all Viennese- need to solve together What’s your main focus at the moment? We are preparing our upcoming event, Find Your Female Co-Founder #3, a platform to match entrepreneurs to meet their potential partners. Not only women but men are also very much welcomed at this event! Secondly, we are focusing on strengthening our community through breakfast meetups, where we share challenges and solve them together through our varied expertise. Thirdly, we are preparing our career incubator (on-job training). More information to come soon! Visit Kulturenreich’s website or follow them on Facebook, Instagram and/or LinkedIn.

"246","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/07/01/lets-talk-food-waste-in-austria/","ImpactHub","Let’s Talk Food Waste in Austria","Austrians throw away one-fifth of all food they buy (Source), of which 14.5% is avoidable or partly avoidable and amounts to 1 billion Euro per year (Source). Austrian consumers are responsible for almost half of the total waste, while agricultural production generates around 30 per cent of the total food waste. Farmers, manufacturers, retailers, and foodservice operators (e.g. hotels, restaurants, caterers) in Austria either produce too much food, which never reaches consumers, or experience food losses through inefficient storage, transportation, or demand planning. Local food loss and waste are never local – they cause ripples impacting market food prices and also contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions. Countries such as Austria, with its developed infrastructure and available economic and social resources, need to lead the way in creating solutions to systematic food waste. Understanding Food Waste First, a simple distinction: food loss vs food waste, as defined by FAO. Food loss refers to any food that is lost in the supply chain between the producer and the market. This may be the result of pre-harvest problems, such as pest infestations, or problems in harvesting, handling, storage, packing or transportation. Some of the underlying causes of food loss include the inadequacy of infrastructure, markets, price mechanisms or even the lack of legal frameworks. Food waste, on the other hand, refers to the discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption. In developed countries, at the retail level, large quantities of food are wasted due to quality standards that over-emphasize appearance. In developing countries, the problem is essentially due to inadequate harvest techniques, poor post-harvest management, lack of suitable infrastructure, processing and packaging, and a lack of marketing information (Source). Impact of Food Waste on Resources Globally, the blue water footprint (i.e. the consumption of surface and groundwater resources) of food waste is about 250 km3, which is equivalent to three times the volume of Lake Geneva. Produced but uneaten food occupies almost 1.4 billion hectares of land; this represents close to 30% of the world’s agricultural land area. While it is difficult to estimate the impact on biodiversity at a global level, food waste is indirectly linked to such practices as monocropping and agriculture expansion into wild areas. These practices result in significant biodiversity loss, including mammals, birds, fish and amphibians (Source). In 2011, FAO estimated that each year one-third of all food produced in the world for human consumption never reached the consumer’s table, but still generated 4.4 carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2-eq), or about 8% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. This means that the contribution of food waste emissions to global warming is almost equivalent (87%) to global road transport emissions. Source: Food wastage footprint & Climate Change http://www.fao.org/3/a-bb144e.pdf When considering food waste and food loss, we also need to look closer at the social and economic impact. According to FAO, in addition to the $1 trillion of direct economic costs per year, the environmental costs of food waste reach around $700 billion and social costs reach around $900 billion (Source). The costs associated with food waste for EU-28 in 2012 are estimated at around 143 billion euros. Two-thirds of the costs are associated with food waste from households (around 98 billion euros). This is due to households a) having more edible food waste than any other sector and b) the costs associated with a tonne of food accumulating along the supply chain (e.g. processing, packaging, retailing costs) (Source). Food Waste As a Byproduct of a Poor System It is true that, in Austria, consumers can significantly contribute to minimising food waste by changing their habits. However, the issue of food waste cannot be solved solely at the consumer level. Food waste needs to be tackled at policy and infrastructure level to prevent the loss of valuable resources even before they reach consumers’ houses. Raising awareness alone will not work if the evidence-based policies preventing food waste are not implemented to transform systems and processes. One of Vienna’s startups, Paradeisa- Der Online Hofladen, currently participating in RE:WIEN 2019 accelerator program, approached the issue of food waste by changing the way consumers in Vienna shop for local products. Austria is an agricultural country with an abundance of locally produced vegetables and fruits. But access to these products is limited – either because of availability in local stores or pricing. Paradeisa, run by Markus Sitek (Management), Isabella Schieszler-Lotschak (Market Development), Michael Apostol, and Vinzenz Schwarz (both Software Development), wants to close the distance between consumers wanting seasonal, regional food at fair prices, and the producers, who want to sell their goods. The direct selling method prevents food loss occurring through traditional retail channels. Paradeisa works together with small-scale enterprises in the region. “In Austria, we are lucky to still have a lot of small farmers who produce excellent food in our vicinity. Unfortunately, it is difficult for consumers – especially in urban areas – to easily get this delicious food. This is why I created Paradeisa. My vision is to make local and seasonal food easily accessible to a large number of people – at a fair price,” explains Markus Sitek, founder of Paradeisa Sustainable production methods and animal welfare play an essential role in the selection of producers. By reducing transport distance and avoiding unnecessary packaging, the carbon footprint of the company is significantly reduced. Becoming a Conscious Buyer Combating food waste in a country such as Austria heavily relies on raising awareness of what the food waste means to us and the actions an individual can take to reduce their waste. One of the ways to mitigate food loss at your own house is to become more aware of how much perishable food you buy and how fast you actually consume it. There is a financial incentive too: Austrian households could save up to €300 annually by planning what and how much food they buy (Source). “At Paradeisa the food producers only deliver what our customers ordered and paid for in advance. So they do not have to return home from the market with unsold goods. Furthermore, our clients consume more consciously. They only buy what they really need and are not tempted by big size offers and special quantity discounts”, commented Markus. Aside from controlling how much to buy, we also need to change our perception of food quality labels and how they dictate food purchases and consumption The countless number of quality labels and marks confuse consumers and lead to uncertainty on how to make purchase decisions. A homepage specifically set up by “Verein zur Förderung von Lebensmitteln mit erhöhter Qualität” (Association for the Promotion of Foods of Higher Quality, VQL) provides a good overview of the recognised national quality labels and EU marks for foods. The ominous “Best Before” stamp is a particularly problematic label. A recent study carried out by the European Commission, published in February 2018, estimates that up to 10% of the 88 million tonnes of food waste generated annually in the EU are linked to date marking (Source). The food expiration date does not actually indicate the timeframe for food being edible – the dates solely indicate freshness and are used by manufacturers to convey when the product is at its peak. Therefore, “Best Before” date should not be used as an indicator of when food should be thrown away. And let’s not forget about the infamous vegetable and fruit “beauty standards” enforced by big retailers… “Our clients also buy – and even appreciate – vegetables and fruits which are not necessarily „ideally” shaped,” added Markus. “Farmers are not forced to throw away a large part of their harvest only because their produce does not meet the standards of big retail companies. That’s why direct sales from food producers to consumers also have a huge impact on food waste mitigation.” The Food Emergency According to Future Agenda, the current predictions of population growth mean that by 2050 we will need 60% more calories every day to feed 9 billion people. If we cut current food loss and food waste, this gap will shrink by 22%. However, solving the issue of food waste and hunger doesn’t only rely on minimising the losses – it requires a major policy overhaul, especially in terms of making nutritious food accessible and affordable to everyone. Let’s not forget local farmers, who should become part of any sustainable fair food chain to support the growing demand for food. Only when we establish a healthy, circular, and resource-efficient food system can we talk about truly solving the issue of food waste in Austria and globally.

"247","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/07/03/founder-spotlight-philipp-etzlinger-from-uugot-it/","ImpactHub","Founder Spotlight: Philipp Etzlinger from uugot.it","What’s the future of language learning? Virtual reality, online classrooms, gamification, AI? While all of these exciting technological developments are happening, one cannot deny the effectiveness of watching TV with subtitles as one of the tools to learn a language. A Viennese start-up, uugot.it, decided to combine the TV approach with new technologies and developed an innovative streaming app, which uses subtitles to help people learn German by watching local TV channels. uugot.it also recently graduated from found! 2019 accelerator program. I spoke to Philipp Etzlinger, the founder and CEO of uugot.it, about his start-up. Impact Hub Vienna: Philipp, tell me a bit about yourself. What’s your background? It must be in technology… Philipp Etzlinger: No, actually, not at all. My background is in Finance. I worked for Deloitte in the auditing department for almost seven years. Later on, I moved to ecoplus, the Business Agency of Lower Austria, where I was a project manager in the investor relations’ department. So basically I was in negotiations with mayors of villages and investors, who would like to build plants and were looking for the right places for them and consulted them on public grants. These were the main areas I focused on. When I started ecoplus, I was already working on the uugot.it idea, but it took some time before we got public funding and to find the right people and the team. So actually we founded the company in April 2016 after receiving the pledge for grants in December 2015. That’s when we started developing the whole thing. Your idea had been brewing for quite a while before you founded uugot.it. How did you get interested in language learning? The roots of this idea reach back to my time in Paris. I was studying in Paris for some time as an Erasmus student. When I moved to France I realised that my French was not good enough to follow the lectures at Grande Ecole. For that reason I first decided not to move in with the other Austrians into a shared flat because that doesn’t force you to speak French. Instead, I shared a flat with a French woman. Most of French people do not speak foreign languages, therefore I knew I would be forced to speak French. In the evening I watched the news on TV. During the day I read “Der Standard” and “Die Presse” and by doing that, it was much easier for me to understand the French news as I already knew the context of what was going on. Anyway it was tough as I didn’t understand a lot of words – so I was sitting in front of the TV strapped with a biro and a notebook, noting down all the words I didn’t understand and looking them up in a dictionary at the same time. Of course, I missed a lot of words and had to realize that I’m not good with that kind of multitasking. The interesting thing was that I discovered that more than half of the international students improved their French in the same way. When I came back to Austria I didn’t think about that anymore. Then in 2013, I was working on another TV project. In a brainstorming session, I thought about what else can you do with a TV and I remembered my time in Paris in 2003. I thought that today, with all the new technology available, we could improve on that way of learning a language. I stumbled over a research study from Kaplan International, which discovered that 82 per cent of those who learn English as a foreign language, use the TV. I did it myself with French, international students in Paris did it too, we could improve that. The idea of the uugot.it was born then. It’s absolutely amazing that you held onto this idea and developed it when the technology came about. Yes, but the story continues. Afterwards I didn’t use my French anymore as in Finance and at Deloitte one only needs English. As a result, I lost a lot of French. I tried to catch on with songs but without subtitles, it was hard to stay focused on it. Same with English. Then I saw Netflix with the subtitles and, as we had a very basic demo, I tried to click on them but nothing happened. I thought that I would like to make my idea happen. And it wasn’t only me, who was struggling. In 2015, the wave of refugees arrived. We realised very quickly that TV is the mirror of society and if people watch local TV, they get to know what that society is like. They learn about traditions and customs. It was also a driver for me in France, when choosing to watch local channels – I wanted to know what challenges the local people faced and what happens in Bordeaux or Montpellier… I also found out that the integration courses in Austria are actually only eight hours. You can’t help people feel comfortable in a completely new culture in just eight hours. It’s a good start but it’s not enough. With a companion like uugot.it, when people can watch the local television, we tear down the language barrier, it’s easier to catch up with society. You mentioned that completing your team took quite a long time. Why was that? Did you have a very clear vision of who you were looking for? It was really important to find the right people to become crucial team members. You asked me before if I have a technical background. I don’t and it was mandatory to find someone who does. We also needed a linguist and someone specialising in didactics. So these were the key positions I was looking out to fill. It was very hard to find the right person for the chief technology officer (CTO) position – during the whole project, we’ve actually had a couple of different CTOs. And it’s tough if you don’t have money to pay people. I mean they lose confidence if you’re invited to present at business agencies and you are in the final jury hearing and finally you get negative feedback. The judges would say it’s a good idea but they wouldn’t believe in the method actually working. This is something we heard a lot and at some point, I decided that we needed research, academic research, to support our concept with, for example, the University of Vienna, and actually conducted one. Another feedback we heard was that people couldn’t imagine how uugot.it worked. So we’ve built a very simple demo that people could actually try out and see it. This took some time because I was still looking for the right people to work with. Either I had to discover that people do not have the required skills or didn’t fit in the team and our mission: h1elping to improve the integration process. I think most of the start-ups have these challenges, that the original founders split up because of disagreements. We had someone on the team, who wasn’t a good match. I realized that too late and, at that time, I was not the CEO of the company. So from the perspective of building your team for a project, especially technology-based project like uugot.it, how do you, as a start-up owner, make sure that this external feedback doesn’t put your team down? That’s a good question! It’s not easy to say what the right way is. I mean, I was kind of frustrated that I needed so many technical co-founders, people who were responsible for technical features and in the beginning, I couldn’t judge people’s abilities to build uugot.it, I didn’t have the insight I have today. And of course, what we developed was not an easy thing to build and we needed expertise from several different fields but didn’t have the budget nor the influence to have experts advise us. We needed to take this process, to build this team we have now in small steps, and eventually rearrange the team. One thing I think is really necessary for team building… When I studied I worked full-time, also beforehand, when I was doing my matura, so I didn’t have regular student life. I didn’t build my network because I was busy. So when I saw other founders, I was kind of jealous that these people “grew up” together, sometimes went to school together and formed their teams. They had deep relationships and “trust” in each other. And I think this is one of the most important things within the team, that you can trust each other. That you know that the other people are also committed 100 per cent and more – and I would not recommend to hire a consultant for your team. This never works. Speaking of trust, you mentioned earlier that one of the repetitive comments you received was questioning the viability of your method of teaching languages. How did you organise the research? This was actually quite simple. We received feedback that the method doesn’t seem right and I said, “Ok, let’s find out”. We researched how to fund a study. Then my first CTO recommended me to contact FFG Innovationsscheck and with the funding received from them, we financed the first study. We asked the University of Vienna, the Department of German Studies to do it, and wanted to get an answer to a very specific question, namely “Are subtitles an appropriate tool for learning foreign languages?”. Professor Dr Boeckmann, who led the study, conducted a meta-study, which comprised of about 50 different studies and the feedback was amazing. Results from 43 studies concluded that subtitles led to boosted foreign language learning. We also showed the researchers our concept and they agreed that interactive subtitles are the right way. They also helped us to improve our concept! Let’s talk about your application. How does it differ from other learning apps on the market? We do not see ourselves so much as a language learning tool even though we are connected to that as well. We see ourselves as a streaming tool – you can stream daily broadcasts and what we do is add interactive same language subtitles, intralingual subtitles, so German broadcast will be equipped with German interactive subtitles. The subtitles are generated by our translation algorithms, based on existing machine translation engines. How it works is when you don’t understand a word you click on it and the word will be translated in that very second. At the same time, each word you click on will be stored within the language learning section. You learn a language using uugot.it but for us, the focus is on the users getting information – you do something you like, watch a broadcast you like and you learn the words you don’t understand in a subconscious way – together with the message. And this helps you understanding Austrian peculiarities. What’s the status of the app right now? It’s usable but not rolled out for general use yet. We only did pilot phases, so far with over 650 people. We have been involved with Austrian educational institutions from a very early stage on, such as VHS Linz and VHS Wien, as well as three universities in Latin America, which already use uugot.it in German language learning. I’m very proud to say that Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the biggest university of Mexico but also the 4th university in terms of reputation in Latin America, is using uugot.it in their language learning courses. How did you establish these partnerships? I have been invited to be a speaker at different national and international conferences, German as foreign language conferences, which is how I made these connections. In terms of VHS Linz that was a bit different – we were part of a project, an incubator programme, which had selected people or firms from Upper Austria to help one start-up get more exposure. In our case, the office of the mayor of Linz discovered us and during a photo shoot, we got to show the first prototype to the mayor, who was very impressed with uugot.it. When I mentioned us doing a field test in a couple of months, he suggested to do it in Linz. Within two months we established a close relationship with the city of Linz and this led to other opportunities. Fast forward to today: where are you now with your start-up? We are in the seed stage. We have our first clients, for example, we have equipped Wissensturm in Linz with uugot.it. We have some announcements coming up in July with a press conference then we will roll out uugot.it. Many thanks for your time and sharing your start-up story!

"248","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/09/27/migration-winedown/","ImpactHub","WineDown: Inclusive Societies and Migration – Impact Hub Vienna","Since 2015, Austrian society has been learning to coexist with an influx of migrants, and although there has always been a mixture of ethnicities, religions, genders, races, and nationalities in the city, the 2015 crisis threw a spotlight on what it meant to try and become a more inclusive society. But the evolution has been bumpy, to say the least. It’s left a lot of social entrepreneurs questioning whether or not innovative business ideas are capable of helping to better include marginalized communities, or if our society is doomed to become more siloed and biased. Last month at Impact Hub Vienna, we invited a panel of social entrepreneurs to speak at WineDown: Inclusive Societies. We looked at two often marginalized communities, women and migrants, and explored how the attitudes towards them have evolved. Each panelist had a unique perspective on what (if anything) had actually improved over the years, whether or not startups in Vienna can be successful in building a more inclusive society, and why our communities seem to be becoming more biased. The founders shaping a more inclusive society The founders on our panel had a variety of different experiences with the marginalized groups. All panelists were female entrepreneurs, and two of them were migrants themselves having come to Austria from Eastern European countries. They were also in different stages of growing their businesses, some later-stage founders and some just starting out. Additionally, each social business focused on supporting migrants and/or women in some way. Based on their unique backgrounds, personal experiences, and individual perspectives, here are a few of the insights they had to share: Annamaria Tolvaly, founder of Bags with Legs: “With the right support, migrant women can be empowered and grow.” Annamaria Tolvaly, founder of the atelier and shop Bags with Legs and a migrant herself, believes that we need to change the narrative we have surrounding migrants and in particular, migrant women. “I grew up in communism in a system where you had to use your own hands to create something. I use the knowledge passed down from my grandmother today in my business. I work with talented and skilled women from Syria and Afghanistan who went through unbelievable [challenges] and are here to learn. They don’t want to just stay at home. That narrative our society gives to migrant women doesn’t reflect them, and we need to change it. We need to show that refugee and migrant women coming from different cultures can adapt very quickly to this dynamic environment.” When asked if social entrepreneurship had the potential to change this perception, Tolvaly responded, “Yes, there is still so much to do. My job as a social entrepreneur is to do my work and create a new energy and attitude toward women with a migrant background.” Andra Weiss (Slaats), founder of Younited Cultures: “ It is time to engage the public and corporates more.” Andra Weiss (Slaats) is the founder of Younited Cultures, a fashion brand that highlights positive aspects of migration by telling migrants’ stories. During the panel, Andra Weiss (Slaats) argued that we as a society have the wrong perception of migration, which she considers to be an inevitable social phenomenon. She remarked, “It is worrisome to note that we are still discussing migration as a negative trend. Refugees and migrants are mostly young people who will invest in the economy. Journalists and the media play a major role in driving negative perceptions around migration.” She argued that social entrepreneurs can improve the lives of the migrants we support and can spread a positive message within that bubble, but there are sectors of society who simply aren’t open to changing their perception. “They aren’t willing to have a dialogue.” Katha Schinkinger, partner at Habibi & Hawara: Katha Schinkinger, another of the panelists, is a partner at Habibi & Hawara. Habibi & Hawara, a restaurant and catering service whose employees are refugees and migrants. In addition to employment, they also have the opportunity to acquire professional training which can be useful once they become independent entrepreneurs themselves. When responding to whether or not she believed that social businesses could be part of changing the perceptions around migrants she said, “We never thought that a little girl from Sweden could change the narrative of the climate crisis. Young people are deeply interested in politics, and they are pissed off. We need to empower them. It is hard, but we need to keep fighting for it.” Recognizing our own bias to foster deeper conversation During the event, our panelists often recognized the very liberal bubble that social entrepreneurs live in and the difficulty of changing perceptions outside that bubble. Francis Rafal, an entrepreneur who is currently running a variety of different ventures, shared an exercise with the audience to help them understand their personal bias and break their filter bubbles. He asked the audience to answer questions anonymously using their mobile device. He asked, “How biased are you compared to the average Austrian?” The result of this brief survey showed that just over 10% of respondents considered themselves to be more biased, 40% of people considered themselves equally willing or less biased and willing to express their affection based on their own opinion compared to the average Austrian. Those opinions are formed based on their experiences of the world, and we need to be open to hearing all sides of the conversation. Based on these results, as well as other indicators confirming such results, Rafal concluded. “Become aware of your bias, audit your environment and think of the five people you spend the most time with. Those people influence you the most. In the end, make active contact with people outside your own filter bubble because everybody wants to be loved and appreciated. If you listen to other people, they might also open their ears to you.” Want to be a part of future events at Impact Hub Vienna where we discuss topics like migration, social inclusions, and other challenges within our society?

Tackling the Difficult Problem of Single-Use Plastic Takeaway Packaging","You finally reach your flat after a full day, and the last thing you want to do is to cook. So you order your food online, the same way you have done many times before. It arrives in plastic, with plastic condiment packets, and wrapped in a plastic bag. Your stomach is happy, you are happy, our planet… not necessarily. Disposable food packaging used traditionally in restaurants, fast food chains and in the catering industry is usually made of inexpensive polystyrene or plastic. Both materials are able to safely contain food for transportation, don’t grow mould or bacteria, and have reasonable insulating properties. On the other hand, take away food packaging is supposed to be cheap and single-use, therefore it’s produced in such way that reusability is out of the question, and the resources spent on manufacturing such packaging are not worth recovering. The same packaging is also impossible to degrade naturally and remains in the environment for generations. As a result, we have produced literal tonnes of the stuff, and we cannot get rid of it. In March, the European Parliament approved a new law within the framework of A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy which bans single-use plastic items such as plates, cutlery, straws, food containers and expanded polystyrene cups by 2021 in an effort to tackle plastic pollution globally. What does the plastic-free future of takeaway food look like? Global plastic pollution According to the EU Commission, global production of plastics has increased twentyfold since the 1960s, reaching 322 million tonnes in 2015. It is expected to double again over the next 20 years. As of 2015, only 9% of plastic waste produced to date is recycled, 12% is incinerated, and 79% accumulates in landfills or the natural environment as litter (source). Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean (source) on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments – “60 % coming from uncollected waste or litter from land-based sources, 20 % from collected plastic waste subsequently leaking into the ocean environment, and 20 % from ocean-based sources such as fisheries” (source). On European beaches alone, plastics make up 80–85 % of marine litter, half of which is single-use plastics (source). Plastic takes more than 400 years to degrade (source), so most of it still exists in some form, such as microplastic. Polystyrene and plastic food packaging alike break down into smaller parts and enter digestive systems of land and water animals, either leading to their death or eventually returning to us in the tap water, in salt and beer, and even in the air we breathe. The effects of microplastics on human health are not yet discovered. But what about recycling? 2025 million takeaway containers per year are used in the European Union (EU) alone – if recycled, disposable takeaway containers could help reduce equivalent greenhouse gas emissions generated annually by 55,000 cars (source). However, takeaway food recycling faces many obstacles. Only 25% of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) used for food packaging in the EU (around 335 000 tonnes per year) is recycled; 30% is incinerated while the rest ends up in landfills (source). The main hurdles are sanitation of polystyrene packaging, which often comes contaminated with greasy food residues. In terms of purely plastic packaging, the Austrian recycling system doesn’t collect it – your “yellow bin” waste is supposed to be made up of plastic bottles and tetrapacks only. In countries such as Austria, where waste-to-energy plants became one of the links in the waste management chain, single-use plastic will travel to incinerators together with the rest of your household waste and burn to ash. However, in many other countries, single-use plastic traveling to landfills or unregulated dumpsites is a common procedure – in this case, plastic will either rot away in piles of thrash for thousands of years or leak into the marine environment. One of the ideas to combat the plastic waste generated by single-use takeaway packaging is to replace the throwaway boxes with reusable containers. Reusable food containers In Austria, around 900,000 tonnes of plastic waste accumulates annually, around a third of which is currently being recycled. Around 300,000 tonnes are packaging waste (source). “The idea for RePhil was born during a course at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. At our campus, there are more than 300 single-use takeaway packages consumed every day. We saw them lying around campus, the bins bursting with them and thought that there must be an alternative to all this waste that is created by takeaway packaging,’ starts the story Hannah Wundsam, one of the founders of RePhil. ‘We discussed why people do not just bring their own reusable boxes to the restaurants, and quickly learned that takeaway is mainly a question of convenience. Even though customers are bothered by the waste they create, it would be too great of an effort to bring their own containers, to wash them and constantly carry them around. When we talked about the topic in the hallway a student approached us, telling us that he overheard our conversation and that he is writing his bachelor thesis about single-use takeaway packaging on campus. The restaurants around the university approached the campus management to ask them for an alternative solution, and Professor Groschopf took the initiative to research about the amount of waste stemming from the takeaway at the campus and what kind of alternatives are out there. This is when we chose to work on a solution that will allow for the convenience of takeaway as we know it, but reduces plastic waste and plastic pollution.’ The team is made of up four members with versatile skills and experience: Cornelia Sochor and Hannah are master students from the Vienna University of Economics and Business and came up with the idea for RePhil during a course of their program “SIMC – Strategy Innovation and Management Control”. They both have work experience in banking, accounting, strategy, and sales. Xaver is a PhD student at the Technical University of Vienna and is responsible for the technology side of the business. Last but not least, Karin, a student at the University of Applied Arts of Vienna studying product design, is responsible for visual branding. The RePhil containers are made of polypropylene and can be reused up to 300 times – after only the 7th reuse, they are more CO2 efficient than single-use containers. But the circularity of the solution doesn’t end there – broken containers will be recycled and made into toys. Encouraging consumers to bring reusable containers to their favourite takeaway spots is nothing new. However, encouraging the restaurants to invest money and resources into providing reusable takeaway containers is a much more difficult feat. This is why RePhil wants to make it more convenient for both consumers and restaurants to drop off the containers and re-distribute them back to the network of partners in Vienna, increasing the convenience and attractiveness of the offer. ‘After having finished their meals, costumers return the empty reusable boxes in our strategically positioned drop-off stations. RePhil collects the dirty boxes, washes them and reallocates them back to the restaurant,’ explains Hannah. Currently entering the first market test, RePhil’s aspirations run high with the desire to replace all single-use packaging in the takeaway and food delivery market in Austria. And we really hope that their dream becomes a reality! Find out how to get involved as a restaurant, customer or a local company on the RePhil’s website.

We brought together investors, startups, executives, intermediaries, and policymakers to explore how each of us in our roles can contribute solutions to some of the world’s current challenges. Most importantly, we kicked off new collaborations and generated ideas to help these solutions truly scale. Here’s a recap of some of the highlights from Impact Days 2019. The day in numbers: 330+ people participated in the conference 3 separate tracks were hosted for deep learning and connection building 20+ countries were represented 25 impact ventures presented their story and work Here were a few key messages from the conference that inspired us: Charly Kleissner (Co-Founder Toniic & KL Felicitas Foundation; Board Chair ImpactAssets)Systems change only under pressure – we can’t predict when the change will happen but we know it will happen. This system doesn’t serve the population anymore. We can be victims or co-creators. I say we will be co-creators. David de Rothschild (Environmentalist and Explorer, Founder Lost Explorer and the Sculpt the Future Foundation)We need to start thinking about innovation. And not from the perspective that we need to design a new app. If you are an innovator you are a creative problem solver. The problems that we face today cannot be solved by politicians. Dr. Rüdiger Fox (CEO, Sympatex Technologies)Every change, especially a dramatic one, needs a lot of time. SDGs are nothing more than global goals for the global economy. A call to action We’ll borrow a few words from Katherine Milligan, (Head of Gender & Diversity, Bamboo Capital Partners) to close: “Talk was great, but now it’s time for action.” It is time to leverage your personal sphere of influence to scale social impact. How can you change your decision making in your personal and professional life to contribute to building a more inclusive, sustainable world? Which SDG can you impact and how can you support it? We hope that you’re asking yourself these tough questions. We hope you have the audacity to challenge the status quo and start scaling impact.

This inflatable device is designed to lift them if they fall and cannot stand up on their own. We talked with Andreas Braun about this startup. How did you come up with the idea for this tool? We did our civil service as paramedics at the Red Cross in Vienna. After a short time, we noticed that many older people fall down on the floor and they are not injured at all but just too weak to get up. Even if they live with a partner, the other person may not have the strength to lift them. So, what do they do? The classic scenario is that they call an ambulance. So, for example, the paramedics get a call, we drive through Vienna, and meet a husband who says, “my wife is lying down on the floor.” We pick her up, conduct a health check, and it only takes five seconds. Then we have to fill out a lot of papers and they pay 36 euros for assistance. And this happens, on average, once or twice a day for a paramedic team during an 8-12 hour shift. In one extreme scenario, a woman called us three times in one day! She just kept falling down. She was not injured, but she simply could not get up alone. And so we had an idea: maybe she needs a personal device that would help her to get up. And if a person is alone, can he or she use such a device? Yes. But the device should be close by. Otherwise, a person on the floor needs a partner to bring the device. Usually, the people who fall down are able to crawl or roll a bit. So the basic principle of our device is that when you fall down, a partner (who must be mobile) can bring you the device and roll it out for you. This process is easy enough that a physically impaired person can do this. Therefore, in this situation, no ambulance is needed. You roll to a flat mattress and the mattress fills up with air and expands to chair. When the problem is solved, the air gets removed from the device and its owner can fold it back and store it. We called our tool “LuftLift.” So it should have some button and work from some electric energy source? Yes, just one button up and down and a small air pump with batteries included and a remote control. Sounds like you have done some product development. What stage are you in now? We received our prototype (after a long long wait) on Monday, the 8th of October. After that, we will test two prototypes with different designs and also redefine our current prototype. At the moment we are using a pump produced by another company, but in the future, we will develop our own control unit for the up and down functions. We want to make our own because it should have several layers of caution that should be controlled separately. You can watch a video of our first tests, with an air mattress and a person lying on it. That’s our teammate actually on the video! As you can see, it’s just a normal mattress from a store, but in reality, it will lift much higher and will have hip support. Who will produce these gadgets? Our production partner is No Problaim. Normally, they make inflatable devices for other companies. For us, it will be custom made. As of January of this year, we have been participating in a program called AWS-first (more info here) which provides Workshops, Mentoring, expertise, and funding for us. How is Impact Hub Vienna supporting your project? We are members of Impact Hub Vienna, and the network gives us a lot of connections. We connect with other actors in the industry and other startups. We are all gathering under one common umbrella, so we can profit from one another. Who are you currently working with on this project? Right now we are in close cooperation with Red Cross, Caritas and other organizations that provide assistance to older people. They are quite interested in this product because many nurses have orthopedic problems due to the fact that they are lifting up people all the time. They already have machines that move people from bed to bed, but our project is the first one to offer a device to lift people from the floor. So we take our prototype, go to them, get the feedback and develop the device following their advice. We will continue working on the prototype until the moment they tell us that it is a viable product for what they need. We don’t have a specific deadline for this project, our focus is really to make it properly. Do you have a business plan and what will be the estimated price of «LuftLift»? Our goal is to sell one unit for about 500 euros, which includes a very slim profit margin. We would like to make it as cheap as possible, and the final price will depend on the number of devices being produced. What do you see in the future for your startup? Right now we are a group of four students, and we have not yet started any company, officially. It’s really our hobby because we’re also in university and have other projects going on. Of course, we are thinking about it, but we can not say how exactly we will develop the project in the future. We don’t know if we will go hard in the private sector. We want to check out our prototype and approach potential customers to see where the biggest need is. For example, if the nursing homes say they need it, it will be a focus.

To this end, the project welcomes EU-based startups with a product or prototype, with established founding teams or wishing to become engaged in product teams or wishing to become engaged in product field-testing. A selection of top 20-25 startups will be involved in a one-week bootcamp, where they will learn about business model innovation, startup methodologies and tools, get additional product validation, define the value proposition and prepare a business case which will be pitched to project representatives. The bootcamp is a competitive arena where only the brilliant and creative ideas will survive to the second stage. The best 5-10 startups, selected from Phase 1, will be invited to a highly intensive 3-month follow-up acceleration program to detail the technical solutions and business model that will make their transport poverty solution viable. During this period, entrepreneurs will be offered the chance to use an open toolbox developed by HiReach and gain a competitive advantage for accelerating novel mobility products. The best 5 startups, selected from Phase 2, will meet and network with decision-makers, consultants, customers, investors and industry operators to test-bed their ideas under real-life conditions, providing unprecedented international recognition and a fast-track to entering a huge untapped market. Impact Hub Vienna is the accelerator and will have the opportunity to impact the future of transportation, managing both a one-week bootcamp and 3 months acceleration program.

"253","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2019/12/09/have-a-very-sustainable-christmas/","ImpactHub","Have a very sustainable Christmas! How to make your Christmas celebrations eco-friendly and ethical in 2019"," It is impossible to think about Christmas in other terms than the times of opulence – we sometimes spend exorbitant sums of money on gifts, cook plenty of food, which often goes to waste, decorate our houses or flats with strings of fairy lights and plastic decor. The world does not let us forget that to celebrate Christmas is to eat, drink and be merry (and don’t hide your wallet). However, in the year 2019, can we ever lose sight of the climate catastrophe playing out in the background? Hey, it’s me, the ghost of sensible Christmas! I came here to remind you that in 2019 eco-anxiety and ecological grief creeped into people’s lives as the news of the effects of anthropogenic activities on our planet tumble in every day mercilessly. At the Hub we will find ourselves huddling over lunch talking about our worries and potential solutions. New innovative ventures come to Impact Hub with ideas addressing renewable energy and energy efficiency, environmental and social impact in Vienna, biodiversity, and literally every other concept advancing the global agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals. Yeah, the situation is dire. However, and I cannot stress this enough, you are the change maker, the impact bringer, the lovely Hubby creature, that knows that individual action means empowerment and that, in our community, individual action causes wide ripples. PS. If I had inadvertently rained on your parade, here are some tips on how to manage climate anxiety from a very smart person, Gillian Caldwell, in her blog “Coming out of the closet: My climate trauma (and yours?)“. Back to the matter at hand – Christmas! This year we shall make that extra effort and bring back the true spirit of Christmas in face of unrolling climate crisis – the spirit of unity with all beings, empathy, kindness and ethical living. We not only speak of sharing, reflecting and purely enjoying this magical time, but also about minimizing your waste, giving back to the society, and letting your credit card have a break. I searched far and wide to bring you the best ideas for not only sustainable but also ethical and eco-friendly Christmas, that you can implement in 2019 straight away! Opt-out of the Unnecessary Gift Shopping Frenzy I am probably a little bit late with this call to arms as the smoke billows over the virtual field of the battle of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, repeating this never gets old: buying should be the last resort. As the famous Buyerarchy of Needs by Sarah Lazarovic nicely visualises, there are many other ways to satisfy your needs. So what sustainable gifts can you magic up? Instead of going loco and worrying about gifting each person you know, collect a group of friends and family and organize Secret Santa. This way each person will give and receive one gift, which means everybody will be happy and you won’t be paying off loans long after Christmas. You can use this website to organize the participants’ list, set the budget and assign names. Make the gifts yourself. Have you been to Pinterest recently? Search DIY gifts and be amazed. Give time. Instead of buying presents, do something with people you care about. For example, go on a Shades Tour together. Why not combine a family outing with volunteering at a local charity? Ask for donations. If you have that family member, who will just not let go of the idea of giving you something (and the experience tells that you will not be happy about that something), ask them to donate to a charity of your choice. Shop preloved goods. Visit Humana or MA48 Tandler store, peruse Willhaben, Shpock, Facebook marketplace or ebay.at. Organize a Christmas gift swap for those, who prefer to not spend money. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. When you still want to buy a brand-new gift, support your local business. Buy gifts from local artisan companies, visit craft markets or support your creative friends’ businesses. If you are part of the Impact Hub Vienna network, tap into the community and ask them what they offer. They are many valid reasons you should be supporting SMBs with your wallet – they pay back into the community and, in comparison to international corporations, are much better in supporting local economy and making social impact happen. Give a gift that keeps on giving. For example: sponsor a meal for a child or seeds for a farmer through Caritas.at; prepare a clothes repair kit with threads, needles, scissors and similar to keep clothes in a good condition for longer; gift a voucher to a workshop from, for example, Zero Waste Austria or Bubbles and Kraut (co-owned by Impact Hub Vienna’s recurring design magician, Jo); gift a potted indoor plant; gift a library card or a yearly museum entry ticket; adopt an olive tree in Italy or a coffee tree (this one comes from Anna Arató from Impact Hub Global) – simply search online to find out how; adopt an animal through Caritas.at; or buy a wooden worm box for the green thumb in your circle. Ran out of time and will have to hit the high-street? Educate yourself beforehand – many of the popular brands we see daily are causing environmental harm and do not take care of the people powering their supply chain. Ethical Consumer and Konsument.at keep tabs on brands we should avoid and brands that do good things. Opt for battery-free gifts if possible. In the US the sales of batteries go up 40% in the holiday season. Batteries, made of toxic and non-degradable chemicals, often end up in landfill and pollute soil and water, not to mention poisoning animals. Re-gifting is okay. No, really. No, there isn’t a special ring in Hell reserved for those of you, who dare to pass an unwanted gift on. Ditch buying new rolls of wrapping paper. Use your paper waste (calendars, posters, maps etc), pieces of fabric, scarves, or glass jars instead. Recently I was in Tokyo – instead of buying wrapping paper, I bought a daily newspaper and used it to wrap and decorate the gifts I bought for my family. Save wrapping paper for the future! Not only the wrapping paper from your gifts – ask everybody in your family to make a pile of wrapping paper and stash it in a cupboard for other gift-wrapping opportunities. To make it easy to reuse wrapping paper, avoid sticky tape and replace it with strings of paper, thread or ribbons. Eco-friendly Christmas Cards Go paperless! Send a free Christmas e-card from websites such as Some e-cards, Blue Mountain or Jib Jab or record a video of yourself wishing your family and friends merry times. Alternatively, if you feel creative, design your own e-card in Canva. Still prefer to send? If you are not convinced by electronic Christmas cards (you have to admit that ‘elfing yourself‘ is pretty awesome) how about making your own Christmas cards from old magazines, wrapping paper, newspapers or…last year’s Christmas cards? Okay, you are dead set on sending Christmas cards. Check out your local charities to see if they sell Christmas cards. By purchasing cards from them you support social causes and give back to the community. In Austria there is for example Unicef at, which offers a wide selection of Weihnachtskarten, as well as SOS-Kinderdorf. Preventing Food Waste & Sustainable Christmas In Europe alone around 88 million tonnes of food is wasted annually, which has an associated cost estimated at 143 billion euros (data from 2016, read the report here). According to a 2019 IPCC land use report, between 25 and 30 % of the food produced worldwide is wasted. Food production is actively contributing to the changes in our climate. That pestering thought that Christmas cannot be enjoyed until the table is overflowing with food? Kill it. “Perhaps one of the most important reasons for food waste at the consumption level in rich countries is that people simply can afford to waste food,” reads FAO’s 2011 “Global food losses and food waste: Extent, causes and prevention” publication. In countries such as Austria, we are spoiled for choice and it makes us equally relaxed about the food we waste. It’s time to change our thinking! (Pst! I have written another article on the food waste in Austria, which you should check out.) Go meatless and/or dairy-free. Even a small change in your menu, which incorporates more plant food and fewer calories from animal products, could significantly contribute to agriculture’s pressure on the environment. There are plenty of delicious meat-free and dairy-free recipes for you to try out! Plan your menu in advance and make a shopping list. Planning what exactly you need to buy will prevent over-buying as shopping behaviour and retail environment have direct links to food waste. While you are in a planning mode, search for versatile recipes for food leftovers too. Love Food Hate Waste has plenty useful tools and tips on how to prevent food waste. Do not overbuy on products, which can go to waste quickly and make sure you store perishables correctly. This fantastic infographic will turn you into the next Martha Stewart. Cut down on packaged food. Here in Vienna, we have many fresh markets, where you can get plastic-free meat, fruit and vegetables. If you make too much food, freeze it or organize a potluck dinner with your neighbors. You can also ask your guests to bring food containers to take lefotver food home. Prepare big portions of mulled wine, punsch, hot chocolate or eggnog instead of buying cans or bottles of soft drinks. Be creative with your organic waste. Keep carrot and parsnip tops, broccoli stalks, potato peels, onion and garlic skins, bones, mix them in a bag, freeze and use as a basis for meat/vegetable stock. Add orange and lemon skins to white vinegar to create a naturally scented cleaning product. Compost the rest. Questions? Ask Pinterest. The Christmas Tree Debate: Plastic vs. Real. Even though plastic trees can be reused each year, their production, storage and transport use up non-renewable resources. Also, an artificial Christmas tree would need to be used for around 10 years for its environmental impact to be lower than real trees, says the Carbon Trust. Let’s be honest: it isn’t rare for plastic Christmas trees to be discarded due to repeated dismantling making them look unattractive, which results in more plastic polluting landfill because, how do I put it, plastic never degrades. If you can, buy a living tree. You can either get one small enough to be kept in a pot for a long time or get one you can replant in your garden. If you do not want to keep your tree after the Christmas season, drop it off at one of the recycling spots in Vienna. Make sure you read up on how to take care of your new green friend! Think of other alternatives. Does it have to be an actual tree? How about a tall pile of books wrapped in fairy lights or a wall decoration made with nails and a string? How about that overgrown house plant? Green Christmas Decorations Skip on the excessive outdoor light installations this year. You will pay less (whether in electricity bill or batteries purchases) and use less of the non-renewable energy. Buy LED fairy lights, which use 90% less energy than the traditional holiday bulbs. Decorate your garden trees with bird feed decorations. How cute are these?! Candles are much more sustainable sources of a warm glow indoors. Not to mention the atmosphere. Turn off the Christmas lights at night. Honestly, if everybody is sleeping, who will be admiring this magical show? Make your own Christmas tree and house decorations. Use dried plants, cinnamon sticks, pinecones, straw, branches of pine trees, paper and ribbons. How about dried orange slices with cloves hanging around the house?

"254","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/02/why-transport-poverty-is-an-issue-of-social-exclusion/","ImpactHub","Why Transport Poverty is an Issue of Social Exclusion","I come from a small village in the south of Poland, which does not have public transport. It also doesn’t have local government-funded transport connections to the bigger cities in a travelling distance. A private network of minivans, the only mode of transportation for those without a car, goes back and forth between Cracow and my home village, often filled to the brim with people. Imagine being squeezed into an overcrowded bus for almost 2 hours during peak times Monday to Friday and you will get the idea. The lack of reliable mode of transportation meant up to 3 hours of commute per day, five times per week, during my school years and being forced to pass up interesting job opportunities as the work schedule wouldn’t allow me to get to the bus stop in time to catch the last ride home. Eventually, in pursuit of education and a better future, I had to move. As the rapid urbanisation trend continues to climb worldwide – by 2050, 83.7% of people in Europe are projected to live in urban areas (European Commission) – more and more people are hit by the phenomenon called “transport poverty”. Countries are not developing urban and urban-adjacent areas fast enough to accommodate the influx and transit needs of the inhabitants, which leaves many people not being able to benefit from a better infrastructure. This problematic urbanisation by-product is not only a serious hindrance to the continuous economic growth – it’s also a major inequality and social disadvantage problem. Particularly affected are the vulnerable groups such as people with reduced mobility, children, younger and older generations, women, migrants and ethnic minorities, and citizens affected by low income or unemployment. What is Transport Poverty? At the time of writing this article there is no standarised definition of transport poverty. According to the Finnish Transport Research Centre Verne at the Tampere University, transport poverty can be defined as “phenomenon that consists of four concepts: mobility poverty, transport affordability, accessibility poverty and exposure to transport externalities.” This description has to be further elaborated on in terms of macro-scale factors (for example, the cost of car ownership or physical location) and micro-scale factors, such as the size of a household, income, street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety (Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice). HiReach, a three-year EU-funded Horizon 2020 project that focuses on the development of new tools and business models to improve accessibility for local areas and communities in need, compiled a list of mobile poverty qualifying components. An individual is transport poor if at least one of the following conditions cannot be fulfilled as they try to satisfy their daily basic activity need: Availability – No suitable transport option available Accessibility – Transport options do not reach destinations and opportunities Affordability – High cost burden Time budget – Excessive amount of time in travel Adequacy – Travel conditions are dangerous, unsafe or unhealthy for the individual Social Effects of Mobile Poverty In itself, transport poverty is a significant obstacle to the fulfillment of basic needs. Lack of suitable transportation means cutting off access to decent job opportunities, education, advanced health assistance and basic amenities available to city dwellers. Transport poverty also perpetuates poverty. For example, low mobility opportunities combined with the requirement to own a car gave rise to the phenomenon known as “Forced Car Ownership’ (FCO)”, which describes a situation in which an individual or a group spends a large chunk of the household budget on the purchase and operation of a car despite also reporting financial difficulties (Household car adoption and financial distress in deprived urban communities: A case of forced car ownership?). The underlying problem with FCO is that many people have to secure a mode of transportation to commute to work in an attempt to improve the financial situation and simultaneously bear the burden of spending large amounts of money on the vehicle as motoring costs increase every year. Transport poverty is a serious concern because it’s existence signals that we are not on the path to achieving equality and sustainability for all. Transportation system and accessibility are referenced as one of the key conditions required for the fulfilment of a wide variety of SDG’s progress milestones (Analysis of the Transport Relevance of Each of the 17 SDGs Report). Social benefits of accessible and convenient transport are explicitly covered by goal number 11- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, through the 11.2 target: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons (SDG Knowledge Platform). Source: SloCaTTransport-related social exclusion is highly individual-specific and takes on different forms as people, particularly the vulnerable groups, struggle to maintain a reasonable quality of life. Women in rural areas are more affected by time-constraints than their city counterparts, while women living in dense urban areas will have their transport decision heavily influenced by the question of safety of their respective neighbourhoods. The elderly or people with disabilities will weigh accessibility and comfort against the number of trips they are forced to make, even if the government waives their bus ticket fees. Further considerations have to be made in terms of income status, which directly influences access to potential mobility solutions, digital savviness or transit access. When any member of our society cannot rely on an affordable and convenient mode of transportation, we cannot talk about achieving inclusive societies. Can We Solve the Issue of Transport Poverty? In the spirit of Impact Hub Vienna, I say: Yes, we can! Transport poverty is not only a social problem, but also a market opportunity for new mobility solutions to reduce time and cost, or even trigger new mobility needs. It’s an avenue of opportunity for innovative transportation startups, which are working on business models that cater to the needs of the most affected disadvantaged groups. The HiReach Startup Lab is an Accelerator Program, which launched in 2019 targeting start-ups, which create mobility solutions for vulnerable groups. It’s part of the EU Project, HiReach. Find out more about the program here. HiReach reaches its last mile in 2020 and invites you to join the final virtual events, a series of two consecutive weeks appointments during which you will find out more about the startups, as well as the program.

It should come as no surprise therefore that the concern for the well-being of the city dwellers was manifested in one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. SDG 11 calls for improvements in air quality, waste management and waste collection, convenient access to public transport and public spaces among other things. Even though Austria ranks among the most liveable countries (with its capital – Vienna – taking the top spot in the quality of living survey), there is a large number of startups and social enterprises that strive to make living in our country even greater than it already is. From recycling to renewable energy systems to enhancing community experience through various social initiatives, these seven companies are trying (and definitely succeeding) to make the world a better place. 1. Wurmkiste With the rising popularity of Zero Waste movement, people are trying to minimize the production of domestic refuse. While implementing more reusable items into your everyday life is already a pretty good contribution, how about all the food waste each household produces? Instead of just throwing it away, why not try to “recycle” the produce waste? David Witzender, the founder of Wurmkiste, had precisely that idea in mind. Having studied agriculture at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, he created his first worm composting bin – or worm box (Wurmkiste) – in 2012. The science behind the box is simple: you either purchase wood and create the box yourself or buy a ready made one, lay it with wet newspaper paper and fill the box with your “starter population” of worms (approximately 500 little crawlers). Give them time to adapt to their new home and start feeding them with food waste coming from your kitchen. The result – in just about 3 weeks the worms will produce humus which can then be used either in the garden or added to the soil for indoor plants for better growth. 2. Urban Gold Another company successfully contributing to the reduction of the waste footprint is Urban Gold. The company is like the King Midas of recyclers – they are able to turn the electronic waste, or e-waste, into pure gold (as well as some other precious metals such as copper, silver, nickel, platinum and palladium – which are usually found in electronic devices). Electronic waste from developed states tends to end up in landfills in Africa or India where it is then recycled by hand in appalling conditions. It is also one of the fastest growing waste streams worldwide and one of the most complicated to recycle. Urban Gold, located in the Styrian town of Leoben, makes the process of extracting rare and precious metals from electric and electronic devices more efficient and sustainable. 3. Green Energy Lab Austria Green Energy Lab is a research initiative for sustainable energy solutions and it is the country’s largest innovation laboratory for renewable energy. The Lab is part of the Austrian innovation campaign “Flagship Region Energy” (“Vorzeigeregion Energie”) of the Climate and Energy Fund. Its test markets spread across 4 Austrian regions – Vienna, Lower Austria, Burgenland and Styria – and it caters to over 5 million customers! Green Energy Lab brings over 100 partners from research, energy industry and the public sector together with the main energy suppliers of the federal regions in order to provide better energy solutions to the users. By 2025, the Lab expects a fivefold increase of the days with 100% renewable energy consumption in the four regions. One of the many projects designed by the Green Energy Lab supports the development of the so-called positive energy districts – urban neighbourhoods with annual net zero energy import and zero CO2 emissions which are simultaneously working towards a surplus production of renewable energy. Who wouldn’t love to live in a city which not only uses alternative energy but also produces its own! 4. Lenkerbande Bicycles are undoubtedly one of the most convenient and sustainable ways to move around a big city. Vienna is no exception to that. According to the Copenhaganize Index – the ranking f the most bicycle-friendly cities on the planet – Vienna currently is in the top 10 cities that has a lot to offer to its cyclists. However, bikes need maintenance. And that is where Lenkerbande comes in. Lenkerbande provides all kinds of bicycle-related services, much more than a regular bike shop has to offer. The people of Lenkerbande fix, recycle and even donate used bicycles in DIY workshops in Vienna. So, not only does Lenkerbande contribute to sustainable mobility, it also makes the means of that mobility sustainable by recycling and reusing old bicycles. In 2015, Lenkerbande started their IntegRadsion project. The project aims at helping newly arrived refugees familiarize themselves with their new surroundings. How? By cycling around their neighborhoods and districts. Lenkerbande collects and repairs donated used bicycles which are then given to the people from refugee backgrounds. 5. MONTREET Sportswear As you can probably tell by the name, MONTREET Sportswear is a clothing brand which produces wind and water-resistant jackets for various outdoor sports, such as climbing, cycling and jogging. The philosophy behind the brand is simple, as Nadine Schratzberger, the brand creator states: why would you do outdoor sports while wearing something that might harm the environment in the long run? All MONTREET jackets can be recycled and reused and, a bonus point, they are even made from recycled polyester! But there’s another thing that make MONTREET jackets special: they are made using the colorful designs by the Viennese artist BOICUT. 6. Shades Tours Shades Tours is a social enterprise which offers educational tours in the cities of Vienna and Graz with the purpose of explaining the many shades of homelessness as well as presenting the multiple Viennese institutions that altogether form the city’s social net. As the guides themselves have been exposed to homelessness, they are the experts on the matter. As of recently, Shades Tours Vienna also offers tours about refuge and integration, and drugs and addiction which are also guided by the affected people. Shades Tours not only gives a chance to have a glimpse into the world many people have never experienced, but also helps people (re)integrate back into society by providing them with a job. Perrine Schober, the founder of Shades Tours, sees the main purpose of her project in bringing the complexity of homelessness, addiction and seeking refuge closer to the tour participants and make them realize that these issues can affect anyone. 7. Frag Nebenan Living in a big city can sometime be quite lonely. You live in a populated apartment building but usually don’t even know who your neighbors are. Frag Nebenan tries to help you get to know the people that live nearby better. After all, you never know when you might need to borrow some salt or need help with finding your missing pet. Frag Nebenan offers a platform that connects residents from neighborhoods who usually wouldn’t have a chance to meet each other. These neighbors are often people from diverse backgrounds and lives, with different talents, interests and needs. The platform gives the residents of the same district or neighborhood an opportunity to self-organize and help each other with various issues, such as babysitting, lending household appliances or helping neighbors that are sick.","January 8, 2020","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sustainable-Development-Goals-and-Social-Entrepreneurship-How-7-Austrian-Startups-Are-Making-the-Cities-Smarter-600x400.jpg"

Nothing to sneeze at, if we say so ourselves. While we all exist under the umbrella of Impact Hub Global, each Impact Hub is a unique place with an offering tailored to the ecosystem in which it exists. Impact Hub Vienna is a diverse community of founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs, which has been growing and flourishing in our quirky space in the 7th district for the past 10 years! We say that at Impact Hub Vienna people innovate with heart, balancing social responsibility with profitability to build a world that works for all. We would like to think that every single one of you, our members, takes full advantage of the opportunities you have at your fingertips. If you are wondering in what ways you can utilise the locally rooted, globally connected Impact Hub network in 2020, our team prepared a Hubby guide to our membership services. Here we go! Ask and You Shall Receive Impact Hub Vienna is many things to many people. For starters, we are a co-working space in Vienna. We are an office for those who buy the FIXED DESK membership. We are something of a temporary stopover for ventures that become visiting members for the duration of our accelerator programs. AND we are also a physical event location in Vienna for both members and nonmembers. Whatever your situation, make sure you take advantage of all the perks of your membership and inform yourself about the available facilities and services that suit your particular needs. We also want you to let us know if things could improve – we are a home to over 600 members and it’s important to us that all of you are satisfied! Have a question about your membership package? Contact your account manager! Contact us online (scroll down to the contact form at the bottom of this page) or come up to the front desk on the ground floor. Alternatively, you can always ask questions and share suggestions in the Facebook group for members – our team will be happy to answer your questions! Be Part of the Community Being part of a community might just be the ticket to help you survive the next decade. When the news feed is all doom and gloom, when you find yourself experiencing climate anxiety, surround yourself with people who are working on making their social impact count. And there’s research that shows there are clear benefits to it! Embracing your community is good for your mental health because it satisfies your innate need to belong. And it considerably increases your quality of life! The longest study on happiness conducted by scientists at Harvard concluded that cultivating relationships is the sure way to lead a healthy and happy life. Without a community behind them, entrepreneurs can often feel like it’s ‘me against the world’. When we factor in the positive social or environmental focus on top of that, that leads industry professionals to view social entrepreneurs as lesser entrepreneurs due to the priority of creating impact over amassing financial wealth, the problem can grow exponentially. Impact Hub Stockholm There’s more good news. According to a Northwestern University study, sitting next to high achievers can increase people’s performance in various jobs by 3% to 16%. Scoot over, Hubbers! Discuss solutions or distract yourself, find a new project to put your energy into or share your worries over a cup of coffee. No longer you have to be isolated at home with your thoughts – you can co-work the pain away! The Hub creatures can become a sounding board and support system for you, offering advice or opinions when you need it – something that is often missing when you work alone on your plan to make the world a better place to live. BE Part of the Community No, this is not a mistake. Being part of the community through working at the Hub is one thing, but actively carving a space for yourself within the living organism that constitutes Impact Hub Vienna is what we are all here for. Share your success stories with us so we can scream about them from the top of the (virtual) mountain because your victory is our victory. No, not in the “we shall steal your thunder” kind of way. In the Hubby “we are super grateful you are letting us share your journey, you glorious person, you” kind of way. Talk to us about your ideas about making Impact Hub Vienna better. Let us exhibit your art. Share something that recently caught your eye in the Impact Hub Vienna Members group. Basically, help us help you. C-O-L-L-A-B-O-R-A-T-E Our space is filled with some of the most talented and creative people the city of Vienna has to offer. Designers, innovators, storytellers, digital experts – people who join co-working spaces because they want to think (and work) outside the box to create something new. This creativity is infectious and can only have a positive effect on you and your work. Take some time to look at the projects of other members and be inspired. Seeing what is possible can help you break through any blocks you have in your own work. Like what you see? Collaborate! The collaborative nature of our communities creates connections that not only increase members’ social capital, but also help to diversify investment sources, accelerate growth and boost impact. According to the 2019 Impact Report, in 2018 alone 1,500 projects were started together by two or more members! That’s not all. The Impact Hub Vienna space located inside Vienna’s hip district is designed for collaboration. From the member wall overlooking the kitchen on the groundfloor, to success stories, cosy pillows, coffee spots, quiet working corners, and lounge areas – we are enabling connection. I think collaboration is really connected with emotions. I want to work with someone because I trust them. Creating this trust is very important and one of the most common things to start this process is coffee. Coffee connects people and having an area where people go to take a break allows people to have conversations which leads to connections and collaboration. Standing tables are also very interesting because it’s been shown that people feel more secure when they are talking while standing up. When you are sitting behind something or sitting down, you’re not as open as you are when you’re standing up. But ultimately, the most important element is to understand how a particular organization or space collaborates and go from there. Creating Collaborative Spaces: An interview with Daniel Utrilla Mellinas Being in the City is Good for Your Business! Physical location is an important element for determining the future of your business. First of all, majority of trailblazing and well-prospering companies are located in areas directly plugged into the innovative urban ecosystems.The cities are the hubs of opportunities! Paul Graham wrote an article Why Startups Fail in which he names remote location disconnected from lively business areas as one of the grave startup mistakes. In a city such as Vienna you have access to support services (Impact Hub Global, Impact Hub Vienna or Vienna Business Agency), you can interact with other founders, you have access to skilled workforce and events, which offer networking opportunities. Impact Hub Vienna can be your home from home when travelling to Vienna. Check out the membership options, which offer registered address and postboxes, as well as key for 24/7 access to the Hub. Host an Event Hosting an event is one of the best ways to showcase your skills and attract new customers while simultaneously contributing to the community. For example, Skillshare Breakfast is a series of 90 minute long workshops hosted by members of Impact Hub Vienna or external professionals, on topics especially relevant for social entrepreneurs. They are taught in the morning while enjoying coffee & yummy food. Skillshare Breakfasts take the skills and expertise present in our community and distribute them among all of us. Do you want to verify your business idea or practice your pitch? Maybe you want to invite people to a skill exchange? Every single membership option offers a discount on event room rental. Take the plunge and host your first event at the Hub! If you are wondering where to start, we have prepared a guide for organizing a successful event! You should also check these four tips for hosting sustainable events. Share Your Success Milestones are important because they provide a sense of achievement and progress. Not to mention a good success story is a powerful tool when you are a new startup without a strong online presence. We are constantly trying to bring our members forward and celebrate their successes on our channels to spread the word about you to as many of our followers as possible. In 2016 we created the Success Stories board managed by the Community Hosting team. It sits quietly in the corner on the ground floor, dressed up in stories from IHVmembers, who made an important milestone. Let us assure you – no success is too small to be celebrated! Whether it’s your personal victory or result of months-long team work, we want to hear from you! Do you want to celebrate your success with us? Send your story to your community team contact person and we will post it on our wall and online. Make sure to include some details, date when it happened and any photos that we could use – please include copyright information if necessary! Show up to Events Attending events at the Hub is one of the best opportunities to jump into the network with both feet. We aren’t saying this because we are trying to boost our foot traffic. You can always make a friend while working at the Hub – we encourage you to say hi to the person next to you – but sometimes context is really important. And, let’s be honest, you aren’t hanging out at the Hub with the goal to meet every single member. Themed events are your best bet to meet people with whom you share interests and let them know who you are! Do you feel like you need a little bit of help with taking your networking game to the next level? Read our guide to becoming a networking superstar. It is so easy to get caught up in our own bubble and forget that there is a whole world out there, full of new ideas and discoveries every day. Attending an event not only gives you the opportunity to meet others but also gives exposure to new ideas that could be implemented in your own business. Impact Hub Vienna prides itself on delivering useful and relevant content by speakers who are in touch with best practices and latest advances. Attending a Skillshare Breakfast or aWineDown could lead you to dramatically improving the way you do business, just by implementing a few key ideas. Our events team is constantly working on keeping the events calendar busy with Skillshare Breakfasts, Melange um Vier sessions, Afternoon Energizers and Koch Doch community lunches, WineDowns and more. Our events are not only about knowledge-sharing and networking – we make sure to keep reminding you that your are a valuable member of the Hub and we would love for you to contribute. Start with being present and see where it takes you. PS. Make sure to visit our calendar of local events, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn to see event updates in your feed.

"257","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/24/ecosystems-of-connectivity-unido-and-global-cleantech/","ImpactHub","Ecosystems of Connectivity – UNIDO and Global Cleantech","The United Nations Industrial Development Organization supports commercialization of innovative cleantech solutions by working with developing country entrepreneurs and taking them to the world stage as part of the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme. Impact Hub Vienna is usually buzzing with start-ups, entrepreneurs, experts, and investors. These impact entrepreneurs have gathered from all over the city, the country, and throughout Europe to create a home for their companies and their networks. The start-up ecosystem in Vienna is vibrant and filled with support in the form of accelerator programs, a supportive community, and inspiring space for like-minded innovators. However, in October, the usually busy entrepreneurial hotspot is full to bursting with global entrepreneurs and investors; with legislators from around the globe and subject matter experts supporting new start-ups. Impact Hub Vienna hosts their annual social and environmental innovation conference, Impact Days. The Impact Days event brings in more than three hundred entrepreneurs and investors together to celebrate social innovation and impact. In 2019, it became a truly global event. The Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP) of the United National International Development Organization (UNIDO), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), have partnered with Impact Hub Vienna to highlight start-ups from around the world that specialize in cleantech. The UNIDO-GEF Global Cleantech Innovation Programme is an initiative to promote affordable and scalable innovations for sustainable energy, enabling partner countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. Strengthening Innovation Ecosystems Partnerships and close collaboration with all national stakeholders are critical to maximize synergies and share knowledge and best practices that can help in enhancing the contribution of cleantech start-ups towards climate change mitigation, while increasing productivity and generating growth and wealth, is UNIDO’s primary claim. And nothing is a better example of this than the integration and partnership between UNIDO and government agencies in South Africa. Senisha Moonsamy, Head of Innovation Skills Development at the Technology Innovation Agency, part of the Department of Science in South Africa, and Susanna Petronella from the UNIDO offices in South Africa sat down to discuss the partnership and the high level of integration between the government, UNIDO, and the GCIP Accelerator. “This is grounded in South Africa’s national development plan,” Moonsamy says. One of GCIP’s highlights is the annual competition-based Accelerator, which identifies the most promising innovators and entrepreneurs in a country, and the selected number of start-ups benefit from a rigorous, competitive national acceleration programme that trains, mentors, promotes, and connects them to potential investors, customers, and partners. “For us, these companies are de-risked and ready to be taken further. The GCIP provides a level of assurance and due diligence,” Moonsamy says of the partnership. The high level of governmental integration means further support can be given to these companies to help them enter global and national economies with a high degree of training and confidence. An excellent example of companies and government working together comes out of South Africa. Simon Hazell is a young entrepreneur who founded Inseco with business partner, Jack Chennells. Their company received the Youth Entrepreneur Award and was the national winner in GCIP South Africa in 2019, as well as the winner of the GCIP Forum 2019. Simon Hazell explains that his company specializes in organic waste management. As is evident by the company name, they use insects in this process. They convert organic waste into sustainable animal feed using insects, specifically black soldier fly larvae. “This provides an alternative to fish meal,” Hazell states. “One tonne of protein in our process means three tonnes of fish are left in the ocean.” Considering the dire predictions of Sea Shepherd, that all oceans could be dead by 2048, this is good news for the global animal agriculture market. The idea came about when Hazell and his business partner were working on a wine farm in South Africa. “They generated large volumes of organic waste,” Hazell says, referring to grape leaves and skins left behind in the wine making process. “We wanted to turn it into something beneficial.” For Hazell and Channells the GCIP “provides them with a great opportunity to access other organization, which will enable them to find partners to assist in soft landing in new markets.” The GCIP accelerator provides training and mentorship to companies, who are ready to take the next step; for some companies this is global investors and partnerships and for others it is taking the first steps on their own with an innovative product. Not matter the stage of development of the product or stage of incorporation, there are experts working within the ecosystems strengthened by UNIDO and national institutions which can help these entrepreneurs achieve their goals. Local Solutions with Global Impacts This year the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme showcased several impact start-ups, which, while solving local issues, have created viable global solutions for some of our most difficult issues. It is a sunny and warm day for October and Boonyarit Soonphonrai, CEO and Founder of Hybrid Aerator in Thailand, a quiet unassuming man sits outside Sophiensaal in Vienna to explain his technical innovation. He has created an energy service solution for waste water treatment. This is a very complicated way of saying he can save companies money with a simple and small solution, which creates an oxygen rich environment for bacteria to treat wastewater. “During my lifetime you could swim in the rivers in Bangkok. You cannot swim there anymore because of the water quality. The poor quality is due primarily to waste water. People do not want to spend the money to treat it properly,” and so it is flushed directly into the river. Soonphonrai used his mechanical engineering background to create a prototype of his solution. He approached a pulp and paper mill to try his prototype and to measure the amount of savings they would achieve on oxygen cannisters, energy, and labour by employing his solution, which is like a distillation column and helps maintain an aerobic environment for bacteria by using the principles of fluid dynamics. This means no oxygen cannisters, which means less waste disposal, less money spent on expensive oxygen cannisters to create an aerobic environment in large vats of waste water, and less labour costs for people adding these cannisters in the process. The Global Cleantech Innovation Programme has provided Soonphonrai the opportunity to speak to other local governments through France, Austria, and other countries in South East Asia about his innovation. Several companies worldwide have adopted his technology to save money and the environment. On the horizon for Soonphonrai and Hybrid Aerator are expansions into vertical farming, as the technology can allow for greater heights in irrigation. Finding a quiet spot in Vienna’s Sophiensaal can be a bit difficult. And in a quiet seating area on the second floor Salma Bougarrani explains what drives her and her company forward. She is the founder of Green WATECH. The confident entrepreneur loved hiking and exploring and while trekking one day was shocked to see children swimming in wastewater in a mountain river. “Cholera is still a pathogen which causes many childhood deaths,” Bougarrani states. “I spend my holidays in rural areas,” where this is still a problem. “I was looking for a way to help my community,” she says of pursuing studies to a PhD level to find a local and efficient solution for wastewater treatment specifically adapted to Morocco. This is quite an accomplishment for a young woman, as there are a dearth of women innovators in the STEM fields and with women holding fewer than 4% of patents, as a US patent office report finds. Her solution is a multi-soil layering technology, which filters waste water through a series of gradient levels ending with the patented brick. The technology has already been installed in two villages and she says the GCIP accelerator supported her through the certification and prototyping process, and helped to develop the company’s readiness. Her technology can be implemented the world over, wherever there are waste water filtration issues which cause disease. Wherever there are water shortages. This technology is an important step forward for the future of the world. The start-up ecosystem for impact entrepreneurs in South Africa, supported by the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme and national institutions has enabled entrepreneurs with big ideas and global impacts to take huge leaps forward with their innovation and global presence. Two further companies working in the impact sphere were at Impact Days, AfroBodies and Trash Cane Burner. Peter Duncan is one of the scientists behind AfroBodies, along with wife and CEO Benedicta Mahlangu. Their company has created a synthetic biological product called an antibody – specifically, a recombinant alpaca antibody, which is also known as a nanobody. Duncan shares a table with Moonsamy and Petronella, and is discussing some of the benefits of his technology. The initial plan was for health care applications but stresses on fruit farmer income and drought in South Africa drove farmers and exporters to look for innovative solutions to create better income security within their industry. Fruit for transport is bathed in chemicals to help in preservation on the long route from South Africa to European tables. However, there is no precise timing for the chemical bath and no specific ratios for the mixture. As a result, “ten to fifteen percent of the fruit is over exposed to these chemicals making them unmarketable. This means farmers plant the equivalent extra in their fields to make up for the loss,” Duncan says. And in an already water stressed environment, this means more fields to irrigate. AfroBodies developed their nanobody and detectors to determine the concentration of chemicals used in these preservative baths to prevent over exposure. “It binds to a specific chemical and makes it detectable and measurable,” Duncan says. “This means more fruit gets to market, and farmers will use less water.” South Africa is currently a water stressed country. However, this also means less food is wasted and there is greater income security for farmers. The detector is the size of a credit card, making it an inexpensive, reliable, and easy solution to several problems. The applications in the medical field are also immense as it could reduce time to diagnosis for fatal long-term illnesses, like cancer, in rural areas by putting testing directly in the hands of local health care practitioners. Food and income security are not just a problem for fruit farmers in South Africa; the sugar industry is subject to extraordinary fluctuations in operating costs due to changing prices in the energy and coals markets. Wolfgang Bernhardt is an older, soft spoken gentleman with an important solution to tonnes of carbon emissions in sugar processing. The engineer, turned management professor, offers a truly unique system which creates a closed economy in sugar processing. He has developed the Trash Cane Burner, which is also the name of his company. “Right now, companies burn coal in the process of making sugar and the leaves are left in the field,” Bernhardt says. “But the sugar cane leaves are rich in energy and are left on the field.” The Cane Trash Burner is a huge piece of industrial machinery, easily filling the airy front entrance of the Hub, according to the dimensions Bernhardt gives. The cost of the machine and its installation means a $12 Million USD investment on the part of a company but it can increase revenue by 50% as it eliminates the need to purchase coal. This decreases the CO2 emissions of processing by almost half as processing plants can now burn the leaves for energy. The sugar and fruit industries are massive and global, and are export income sources for many in developing countries. The South African ecosystem offers a well-connected and well-supported environment for innovation to thrive, as exemplified by these impact entrepreneurs and their projects. Innovative Futures Many of the ventures discussed their next steps and what they hope to see in their future. The Global Cleantech Innovation Program will continue to offer entrepreneurs the benefits of a well-connected and global innovation ecosystem. South Africa is expanding the reach of the program, according to Moonsamy. The program now includes two-week placements at Oxford University and outreach programs to historically black universities in South Africa to redress the imbalances of the past and help move innovation forward. Moonsamy said they were working with UNIDO partners to implement new parts of the program elsewhere in the world. The global future of cleantech is bright because of the partnerships UNIDO has fostered with the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme.

Accelerator Program Announces the 2020 Finalists","The fourth round of found! has officially started! Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna selected the most innovative teams for their jointly organised social start-up program from numerous interesting submissions. The six ventures are now starting a 5-month incubation phase to work with experts on their business plans. Their unifying goal is to create opportunities for people with a refugee background. In cooperation with the Impact Hub Vienna, the Deloitte Future Fund has been supporting socially oriented start-ups since 2016 through targeted workshops, mentorships and professional advice under the umbrella of found! program. This has already created numerous jobs and better job market opportunities for refugees in Austria. This year, too, as the next edition of found! is officially kicked off, the business models of all program participants are geared towards this purpose. “Our finalists are committed to a common goal: to promote the successful integration of refugees in the domestic job market. The high relevance of this topic remains undiminished and we are proud to make a valuable contribution in this area, ” says Bernhard Gröhs, CEO of Deloitte Austria. The six teams will again be accompanied by experts from Deloitte and the Impact Hub. As part of a 5-month incubation phase, intensive work is carried out to optimize the various business models. The two most promising start-ups will be selected by an expert jury at the end of the program and will receive further financial support as well as pro bono advice. “We are happy that found! program is entering its fourth round and we look forward to working with very exciting participants again this year. We have a diverse cohort, a mixture of already established social businesses as well as promising projects in the idea development phase, ” explains Lena Gansterer, Managing Director of Impact Hub Vienna.

"259","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/01/31/how-corporate-volunteering-can-benefit-your-company/","ImpactHub","How Corporate Volunteering Can Benefit Your Company","According to the Deloitte Volunteerism Survey from 2017, 9 out of 10 respondents believe that companies who sponsor volunteering activities offer a better working environment that those who don’t. Encouraging, supporting and coordinating employees to participate in volunteering events is not only a powerful way to give back to the community but also positively impacts the employees’ relationship with their companies. Volunteering increases one’s satisfaction and motivation, and as shown in the study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation, it is also a great opportunity for professional and personal development. Research done by Points of Light Foundation shows that well designed corporate volunteering program acts as a unique talent development tool, potentially replacing formal training. And we are talking about much more than just team building! Corporate volunteering is also a great way to boost interpersonal or problem-solving skills as most of the time volunteers are faced with challenges that they need to overcome with very limited resources. Did you know that active volunteers move more easily into leadership roles? That’s not all – by being able to volunteer on behalf of the employer, employees get to know each other in a different way, often eliminating the hierarchy and leading to stronger identification with the company. And all of these employee-related benefits have a positive impact on companies – corporate volunteering is a cost-effective way to develop employees, increase workforce engagement and eventually become a more attractive place to work. And let’s not forget about the initial beneficiaries – non-profits themselves that receive time and know-how support, opportunity to establish new personal relationships and find advocates for the mission as well as potential donor relationship. How to Make the Most out of Corporate Volunteering To reap the full benefits of corporate volunteering, it is crucial that the program is well structured. While employee volunteering is relatively new in the European market there are plenty of examples and experiences to learn from coming from the US. Corporate volunteering can take different forms: hands-on or high-skilled, individual or group, one-off or regular. Below are some of the most popular approaches to making a valuable social contribution in the form of corporate volunteering. Social/impact days: team building events for good, when employees spend a day supporting a chosen non-profit usually with hands-on experience such as cooking in a shelter, planting trees or joining environmental clean-ups. Hackathons: One-day event where employees & non-pro<U+FB01>ts work together to solve problems or boost non-profits’ growth. For example, new online presence, fundraising campaign or HR strategy. It can also have a form of a challenge or competition. Individual volunteering: time and opportunities provided and coordinated by the employer, which allow employees to independently schedule and manage their level of contribution. How to Link Corporate Volunteering to Your Business’ Growth While the social impact benefit of corporate volunteering is obvious, as a company you are also thinking about the investment such program will entail. Corporate volunteering requires time and resources to set up, as well as potentially some financial investment. No matter how your company decides to get engaged, it’s important to maximise the benefits of corporate volunteering by connecting it with your business strategy. Five points below sum up what to keep in mind when designing a corporate volunteering program. Set up clear goals – it is important to have different internal stakeholders aligned from the very beginning, HR and CSR should work on that together. Be authentic! Tie the engagement to the mission and vision of the company. Let the employees do what they are good at – be creative and explore different partnerships. Make sure the engagement is high – get the buy-in from the top and promote, promote, promote internally. Measure the impact (internally and externally) – well-reported programs can be tied to the business outcomes of the company. It will make it easier to invest in social engagement in the future. Designing such a program requires not only extra resources on the side of the company but also non-profits. Companies often face dif<U+FB01>culties in identifying and arranging corporate volunteering opportunity and assessing its impact. They often do not know what the possibilities are and are not fully informed about the questions they should be asking. Some nonprofits advertise their willingness to establish partnerships to make corporate volunteering easier, but many don’t have enough resources to make it happen. This is how organizations such as Social Held step in. To bridge the gap between the willing companies and non-profits that need support, Social Held provides the expertise and know-how to create a seamless experience in finding the right volunteering opportunity for your company.

It’s a major milestone for our community and we cannot really express how grateful we are to have been part of so many people’s lives. Right off the bat, a HUGE thank you! Right now it doesn’t seem like a great time to celebrate – so many of us have been affected by the novel coronavirus spreading in the world. It’s easy to forget that in January, our lives looked so much different. Yet, we do want to remind you that the community that grew at Lindengasse 56 has always been resilient. The social impact community have always gone up against challenges that seemed too big to handle but, brick by brick, since 2010, we build solutions that bridge gaps in the areas of education, social inclusion, food value chain, circular economy, technology, and many, many more. This impact story comes from Jakob Detering, Managing Director, Social Impact Award International. Social Impact Award, founded in 2009, runs education and incubation programs in more than 15 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia to support early-stage social entrepreneurs in developing and implementing innovative business solutions to tackle the most important societal challenges of our times. They do so by hosting events and organizing workshops to raise awareness for social entrepreneurship, teaching the necessary skills to navigate from vague intentions to promising ventures, providing access to networks and promoting the best teams with the Social Impact Award. Impact is…Community In May 2010, I heard of the Social Impact Award for the very first time. With only a week left until the submission deadline, I decided I want to apply with an idea for a social business in Romania. Not to really implement the idea, but rather to learn how to write a business plan with a social focus. I skipped all my university courses at WU Vienna that week and started writing my SIA application. On the last day before the submission deadline, the Impact Hub opened its doors for all students that wanted to apply at SIA. I went there and finished my application (sitting at the same table for the whole day with Georg Tarne, who, shortly after successfully founded Soulbottles). After I submitted my application with just 5 minutes before the deadline – Georg and I had a beer together. We felt very happy about finishing the application on time! In the following weeks, I didn’t think much of the application anymore. After all, I had accomplished what I aimed for: writing a concise social business plan. It was why I was really surprised when a friend of mine (Leon Rainer, who founded Impact Hub Berlin a few years later), asked me if I would join him to attend the SIA award ceremony. He mentioned they offered free drinks – I couldn’t resist such an incentive! It turned out to be great fun anyway; I was fascinated by the Impact Hub Community, by all the ideas flying around in the room and the diversity of stakeholders present at the event. I grabbed my free beer and listened to the announcement of winners. Suddenly, the moderator (Nicole Traxler, today at Erste Foundation and CEO of BeeTwo) called me up on stage and announced that my idea won. I hadn’t expected that at all. Not that I didn’t find the idea or the plan worth the award, but the social business was to be implemented in Romania, while I was living and studying in Vienna. I had simply assumed that the SIA jury would never take the idea seriously. Yet, here I was. I heard it right. They called my name and invited me to the stage. I went up and found myself standing next to Prof. Nikolaus Franke, whom I knew only from my entrepreneurship courses at WU. As it was a hot summer day, I was dressed in a summer shirt, shorts and flip flops. While standing next to Prof. Franke in his elegant suit and answering his questions about my idea, I realized that this was a quite inappropriate style. After Prof. Franke finished his short interview, the event photographer shot the picture: I still hold this picture dear to my heart, even 10 years later, as it was the start of my journey into the world of social entrepreneurship. I had no clue what I was signing up for. Everything was new and I was totally unprepared – a sentiment best illustrated by my dress code that evening! However, the Impact Hub community was so open-minded and inviting that I felt home from the very first day. Whenever nowadays I’m attending SIA events in Europe, Africa and Asia (which happens a lot), I’m sharing this story and the flip flop picture with the audience. And the message is simple: It doesn’t matter how prepared or ready you feel for changing the world. It only matters if you have a supportive community around that believes in your idea and your talent. The Impact Hub Vienna has been this community to me in the last ten years. I’m extremely grateful for that. Jakob Detering Managing Director of Social Impact Award International PS. We need your help! The novel coronavirus poses a threat to our health, its aftermath will shake up our society and impact our economy for a long time.

With today’s conversation, we want to add to this list an important topic, explored by one of the participants of the 2020 found! program by Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna: barriers to leisure time. As Rosa Haltmeyer, one of the co-founders of Vienna Hobby Lobby said, “Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generating ideas.” With that, I invite you to find out how this Viennese start-up supports children from disadvantaged backgrounds in learning outside of school. * Please note that we recorded the interview in February 2020 and it doesn’t directly address the current coronavirus situation. * (Top row, left to right) Farah Saad (frida), Ariane Olschak (frida), Petra Aji (FoodStories), Rosa Haltmeyer (Vienna Hobby Lobby), Leila Salehiravesh ([email protected]), (Bottom row, left to right) Valerie Mühlenburg (the CONNECTION), Diana Reuchlin (the CONNECTION), Denise Diex (ÖkonoWie?), Jasmin Abou Ahmed (ÖkonoWie). Photo © Lea Fabienne Photography – View the press release announcing the 2020 cohortHi, Rosa! Thank you for meeting me. To kick off the conversation, share with us your elevator pitch. Would love to! We have to pitch all the time recently! The Vienna Hobby Lobby offers free leisure courses for children in need. There are 400,000 pupils and teenagers that live in poverty in Austria and, as I started teaching in middle school in Vienna, I realised that almost all of them could not afford to go to dancing lessons or to a football game. We decided to offer these courses for free because we want all kids to be able to have free time activities and something to do after school. We want them to feel inspired, to get to know other kids in their communities and their districts. Leisure time activities should not be a privilege and we saw that it almost had become that in the last couple of years. What I am hearing is that you have been a teacher before you founded the Vienna Hobby Lobby. What is your background? Yes, although it is a little complicated! I attended fashion school in Vienna Hetzendorf, and then I switched to a BSc in national economics. During my undergraduate study, I started to get deeper into social policy and also migration and the educational system in Austria. I wrote my dissertation about the latter and this is how I got to know Teach for Austria, which is a great program through which you can teach even without studying to be a teacher specifically. I entered Teach for Austria. On top of that, and it sounds a bit cheesy, I always wanted to give back what I received. I received a great education and I had that possibility too to harness the opportunities given to me because my family always could afford that. Even though Austrian education is free, you still need your parents’ support, for them to know about the system and how it works. To compare, getting a good education was much easier for me than for a child from Syria, that only got here three years ago and is facing different problems. I always wanted to go in that direction, in the direction of supporting children that needed the most support. It sounds to me that you are a multi passionate person! That’s correct! But it’s often hard and a bit confusing! (laughter) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vienna Hobby Lobby (@viennahobbylobby) on Mar 31, 2020 at 2:24am PDT You are one of the four founders of your startup. How did you meet your co-founders? I actually met them through Teach for Austria. I discovered that I had a student, let’s call her Amanda. She always stayed late into the afternoon at my classes even though she had finished school already. Amanda did not want to go home because nobody was home, her parents worked a lot and they did not have much money left to afford to pay for some additional activities in the afternoon. This is when I realised that there are so many children that need something to do after school. I started talking about the lack of possibilities in the afternoon, the lack of support, anything that me and my colleagues always had as kids. Some colleagues, my co-founders, agreed with me that there were so many issues with what to do after school with these kids, who would come back from their holidays and say “It’s great that we are back to school because there was nothing for us to do at home”. That’s what connected us and we started working together. It’s absolutely great to have them in our team. From meeting your co-founders through Teach for Austria to getting into social entrepreneurship, that’s a bit of a jump. What motivated you to turn this passion project into a business? I always was afraid of becoming a social entrepreneur. It’s honestly the thing that I never wanted to get into because I knew how hard it could be, how stressful and tough it can become. It’s not always easy and it’s not always as glamorous as we think. Social entrepreneurship is really hard to get into. With the team, we had started already in my second year of Teach for Austria program and the events we organised attracted so many kids. The instructors, who were working with us on a volunteering basis, were so passionate about the project. Then, last year, we got into the Social Impact Award 2019 final and won, which meant we received some money to put into the idea. This is when I thought that maybe I should quit my job and focus on the project full-time. It wasn’t the social entrepreneurship aspect that attracted me but the prospect of seeing my project grow into a bigger idea, a project that is accessible to children all over Vienna. Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generate ideas. We want to make all children access that, develop themselves, have the same chances. Education doesn’t stop when the school ends, everything is about continuing to learn and generate ideas. We want to make all children access that, develop themselves, have the same chances. This motivation pushed me to take on this burden, become a social entrepreneur and pursue the goal, which is bigger than the job. Tell me a bit more about the business side of your idea. How did you approach market research to further identify this market niche? We already saw the gap based on our experiences. We performed an analysis, did a thorough desk research and found some projects that were doing similar things. For example, Wien Extra, which is amazing but doesn’t reach the children we encountered somehow. We talked with a lot of youth centres and they saw the need for something with passion, something different, that would engage kids and not only fill their time but also connect with them. We created a mini-pilot phase from March to May 2019 with seven courses and went into the schools and pitched our idea. A few kids came in the beginning and then more kids showed up. Actually, the demand was so huge in the end that we decided that this is worth pursuing. In our second phase, from September to December 2019, we launched 13 courses and we had more than 400 applications out of seven schools in the 10th district, in Favoriten. Who is the target group of Vienna Hobbly Lobby? We actually have two target groups. One of our target groups are children, and then we also target kids from middle schools within the Favoriten district. Our kids come from different backgrounds; they are migrant kids and special needs children, kids from Austria, too. There is another dimension to our project. Some of our instructors are also refugees, whom I met through different projects I was involved with. I got to know their problems and about their lives in Vienna, how difficult it was for them to get the permit to work. I suggested to them to join us and, in the past, almost half of our instructors had migrant or refugee backgrounds. They became these amazing role models for the children because they connected through their cultures and their understanding of various cultures. Everything works fine – the Turkish photographer is amazing with Serbian kids, Austrian kids and Turkish kids alike. The kickboxing trainer is from Damascus and he treats everyone the same but he also understands Arabic. They have so many different stories and they are willing to get involved with the project to gain more experience, to work with children. So, this started as a program for children only, but now we also focus on our instructors too. What would you say, as an educator yourself, are the particularly useful skills for someone working with kids with refugee or migrant backgrounds? I don’t think you need any special skill set, kids are all the same. They are amazing, they are impatient, but also passionate. Some are loud, some are quiet. You have these amazing small people, who are developing in their own kind of ways. What you need is what every teacher needs: they need to respect you, you need to know their boundaries, to have the cultural understanding of what they are going through. This is how we train our instructors as well, to see how to deal with conflict and deal with different religions and beliefs in one group. It’s way simpler than it seems. In your journey to becoming a founder, you mentioned that you knew beforehand what challenges entrepreneurship brings. It sounds to me that you were already in the circle of social entrepreneurship. Yes, we were already quite connected through Teach for Austria, they provide information about what to do after the 2-years fellowship program. When we started to create this pilot phase we also talked about getting funding, how to finance the project and what we will offer. Through the workshop with the Social Impact Award we connected to this network and we got to know Impact Hub Vienna too. Being in the SIA community we got to know found! and someone approached us and suggested that we should apply to the program. And this is how we qualified! I also studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and knew a lot about their activities. Everything is so well connected and it’s fantastic that you can get to know the people and information so quickly. There is always someone to help you out and suggest a new route or a new program, a grant. I like that everyone is so helpful and supporting each other. Sometimes there are conflicts and jealousy. However, in general, everyone is cheering each other and working together rather than against each other. What were the most helpful elements that propelled you further on your entrepreneur journey? I think it is a little bit of everything. The people you get to know and the connections you make, the stories you hear. You meet these great people, everyone wants to help, has an idea or feedback. Sometimes it’s absolutely horrible feedback, it really gets to you because the project is your baby. But this kind of feedback helps you even more than the praises that you get. The colleagues you find are another helpful aspect of being part of this ecosystem, you collaborate and form friendships. Finally, it’s the methods and business skills that you learn during different programs. For example, writing business plans, how to pitch, impact evaluation, and how to think about your finances. I studied economics so I was fine with the business and financial sides, but had to learn more about applying this knowledge in a social entrepreneurship environment. There is so much to learn! Now you are part of found! accelerator program. First of all, congratulations on being selected! Secondly, how has it been so far? Thank you! It’s amazing, even if we discussed some topics we have heard about previously, it also brought new interesting insights and perspectives. New ideas were generated and so many great people join you in your journey. It’s one of the best aspects of the program that you get access to such smart people, who root for you and email you things to do, discuss with you. They cheer you on and are happy with you when you succeed, just like recently, when the Vienna Hobby Lobby received a 10,000 Euro grant from MEGA Bildungsstiftung! This spirit of support is really something special.

They cheer you on and are happy with you when you succeed, just like recently, when the Vienna Hobby Lobby received a 10,000 Euro grant from MEGA Bildungsstiftung! This spirit of support is really something special. I just want to say that the Deloitte mentors are amazing! We have these three people, who are so deeply involved and share so much knowledge with us. It’s such a privilege! You have been running the Vienna Hobby Lobby for one and a half years now. What would you say are the biggest lessons you learned in that period? First of all, never give up. Our journey has been a constant of ups and downs, ups and downs, and after every lowest point there is an extremely happy moment two days later. It’s a rollercoaster. Then, I would say, enjoy the team spirit. You can learn something new from everyone within the team, everyone has a talent, a strength, that is useful. It’s amazing to see how much these different talents are needed within our team. The team spirit is everything, the project is only as good as the people who work on it. If you have a great team, you achieve bigger goals. Don’t forget to celebrate the successes you reach. Money is tight and this is true for everyone, who is an entrepreneur. You have to be creative, you have to think a little bit differently, to solve the issue of limited financial resources. There is one question that I have been meaning to ask you. At Impact Hub Vienna we talk a lot about being an entrepreneur and entrepreneurs suffering from burnout. How do you manage when things get harder? We talked about burnout and stress a lot during the Social Impact Award and back then, I still had my job and I wasn’t a full-time entrepreneur. Once that changed, almost a month into it, I crashed. I had panic attacks, everything was too much because being an entrepreneur is very intense. I completely forgot what I learned during SIA, to put the project aside, take care of myself. It’s really tough sometimes. I still feel very anxious, overwhelmed, and two weeks later I feel complete joy and happiness because the project is going well. I think that fear of failure is a real issue and the pressure of everything happening at the same time. We should talk about this more openly, talk about coaching and therapy because you can’t do it yourself. You need a coach, a mentor. I am super lucky because we had a great mentor during SIA and we got three amazing mentors now, through found!. It’s really helpful to talk to people. I also have a coach whom I see on a weekly basis so I don’t lose my sanity. We should focus on these illnesses that we do not see easily, the illnesses plaguing my generation especially. Everyone is stressed all the time. It’s really important to be at peace with yourself, listen to yourself and take time to recover. You seem to be taking a very proactive approach now to manage stress! Yes, now I am! It took me nine months to figure out how to manage my schedule, how I want to work, what my routine is, what my outlet is. I do yoga in the morning, before I go into the day, I will get up earlier if I have to because it helps me. And there is one more thing that really helps me – budgeting. It really helped me to put a good budget in place, to really think about the future and save money. As an entrepreneur, you are responsible for people you work with and removing the financial anxiety helps so much. This realisation came to me during the found! program, as we are tackling the financial side of our venture quite intensively with the mentors. We have already had some successes thanks to the program! Thank you so much, Rosa! It was lovely to chat with you and I wish you even more success throughout the found! program and beyond!

As the fifth week of physical distancing in Austria is coming to a close, many of us – social impact founders, creatives, investors, established companies and NGOs that make up the Impact Hub Vienna’s network – are looking to get a sliver of normality back into our lives with the announced loosened COVID-19 measures. Impact Hub Vienna community like everyone else has been affected by the economic downturn caused by the novel coronavirus, in smaller or bigger ways. We see you! And as a community, we remain committed to pushing forward. We are not losing hope nor willingness to innovate, collaborate, support and ideate! And we are here to act. Here’s a list of do-good things that you can do right now to support the amazing change-makers in Vienna. #1 Think Be Local I am sure you have seen many calls to support your local businesses on social media – I have! However, as the messages to think about engaging with local businesses flooded your feeds, have you ever thought about the meaning of being a local? How well do you know your neighbourhood? Would you ace a quiz on the social impact scene in Vienna? Have you tried the delicious hummus from Habibi & Hawara? Or the burgers by Rebel Meat? Do you own a pair of socks from Younited Cultures? Have you gone on a tour with Shades Tours? Being a connected local extends beyond going to your supermarket two streets away – it means getting to know your environment, discovering your city’s hidden corners, being able to recommend places to visitors, supporting the social businesses that contribute to making Vienna a much better place to live. How to be local: explore your city on foot make a “to try” list join the „Ich kauf’ nebenan – Wien“ (Gruppe) Facebook group swap recommendations with friends, family and other Impact Hub Vienna members rave about the shops and brands you love online – social media and business listings remain the top source of referrals for local businesses make your “Favourite Viennese Businesses” list and share it online #2 Try Something New Right now, we all are looking for entertainment. Online subscription numbers are spiking, we are listening to more podcasts, trying out new furniture arrangement in our living rooms. This push towards trying new things caused by an abundance of free time is quite beneficial for our well-being due to the fact that our brains LOVE and reward novelty. Experiencing something new increases dopamine levels in our brain, a hormone and neurotransmitter also known as “reward chemical” or “happy hormone”. The next time you want to buy something different, new, exciting, peruse this list of Austrian social impact businesses created by our member, Reinhard Herok, from way to passion. Learn something new! Content Creation School, uugot.it, Zero Waste Austria, UpLeveled offer interesting online courses. #3 Make Use of Your Online Voice The strict no-contact rules that were implemented to flatten the curve showed us the possibilities of technology. The Internet became an even brighter and bigger window to the world. There’s plenty of things each of us can do to help social businesses survive through the lockdown and help them restart their activities in May.

It goes like this: a person enters the social impact innovation scene through the WU or BOKU universities, or through one of our many partners. They weave through the common connections, eventually finding their way to Impact Hub Vienna. One of such stories comes from Alpengummi, an innovative Austrian startup that often is featured in many podcasts, articles, TV or radio shows nationwide. And it’s not surprising – Claudia and Sandra, Alpengummi co-founders, are making big strides in getting their product to reach as many people as possible. Recently, they launched a crowdfunding campaign to purchase two production machines for their business! View this post on Instagram Endspurt! Am Freitag, 15.5. endet unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne auf www.startnext.com/alpengummi, das heißt auch die tollen einmaligen Angebote, die es exklusiv für unsere Crowd gibt <U+0001F642> also schaut rein & sichert euch coole Alpengummi-Sachen! <U+0001F600> #crowdfunding #alpengummi #endspurt #lastchance #coolesachen #sustainablestartup A post shared by Alpengummi (@alpengummi) on May 11, 2020 at 8:03am PDT The story of Alpengummi is one of the beautiful environmental impact stories that we like to think about to get motivated. Without further ado, here’s how Claudia and Sandra remember their Impact Hub Vienna moment of connection! Impact is…Support Network We had the idea of a natural chewing gum, based on natural and regional resources, during our international studies of environmental sciences at the BOKU University in Vienna. Alpengummi started as an idea for a business plan in a lecture that was aiming at fostering innovations in the forest sector. After we had created our business plan and had finished our first experiments in our own kitchen – which, we can tell you, was a highly sticky process, as we use tree resin as the main ingredient for our gum base – we decided it was time to share our idea with others. We started to organize tastings and looked for feedback to improve our chewing gum recipe. At about the same time, in spring 2018, the startup competition innovate4nature started its application round. innovate4nature is an annual startup competition from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Impact Hub Vienna supported by the federal government and the European Union, which offers an accelerator path for ideas that foster biodiversity and promote responsible production practices in Austria. Although our product development was not finished yet, we decided to apply. We were selected into the top ideas of the competition and thereby won a 6-months program membership, which included free working space at Impact Hub, support by experts and in the form of workshops, as well as 5.000€. This allowed us to improve our business plan and the product itself. In the end of the program, we also won the finals, which has further increased our money pot by 10.000€. Now we had enough money to seriously start developing the gum recipe and start the preparations for selling our gum. In April 2019, we took part in the Austrian TV-Show “2Minuten2Millionen”, where startups can look for investors and present their ideas to the Austrian public. This was the moment when we started to sell our Alpengummi – first at Billa and Merkur, then at small shops all over Austria. Later, we also opened our own onlineshop at www.alpengummi.shop. During all this time, we were mostly a two-girl-team, producing all the chewing gums by hand (until today we have produced 50.000 packs of gums), while also organizing everything else that a company needs (from sales to marketing and beyond) – mostly doing so from our co-working-space at Impact Hub, where we constantly got useful feedback and made a lot of long-lasting contacts. At this point, we must mention that we also met our graphic designer at a skillshare breakfast at Impact Hub: Natalia Garcez, a Brasilian freelancer, developed the amazing design of our Alpengummi. We were lucky that another program opened up at Impact Hub Vienna in 2019 – the RE:WIEN program by Oeko Business Vienna and Impact Hub Vienna. This incubation program supports start-ups and ventures which are based in Vienna and have developed an innovative product or service with great market potential. It was simply perfect for us and allowed us to keep our working space there for another half a year, while getting further professional help and feedback for our business. We are very thankful for all the great support, amazing contacts, professional help and warm hugs that we have received over the past couple of years at Impact Hub Vienna. The time at Impact Hub shaped our business journey and we felt part of a big family of social- and environmental entrepreneurs. The Impact Hub Vienna is still using our chewing gums as a thank-you goodie for special events and we hope that we will keep up this flourishing collaboration in the future! Claudia & Sandra Founders of Alpengummi PS. Want to become a social impact supporter? The novel coronavirus poses a threat to our health, its aftermath will shake up our society and impact our economy for a long time. And especially the field of social innovation is at risk to have its progress thrown back by years, should some of its most promising and impactful actors, as well as the many still small yet beautiful initiatives, be forced to end their endeavors. Our members are affected by the economic downturn and we want to help them get through the tough times. We launched a Solidarity Fund, open to all current members of Impact Hub Vienna.

While we are more aware of the existing hurdles and manage to build bridges in the job market, we are also still innovating the best possible solutions to making the entry obstacles easier to overcome. For a person who arrives in Austria without knowing the language or the culture, the first contact with Austrian legal system and paperwork can be really tough. This is why social impact startups like frida are helping to increase inclusivity. frida offers free and independent legal counselling for refugees and migrants, combining the two areas of law. Today we are happy to share an e-mail interview with the co-founders of frida: Ariane Olschak, Farah Saad, Marianna Mkrtchyan and Philipp Schmidtmayr. frida is also one of the ventures participating in the 2020 found! program by Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna. Who’s behind frida? Our key team members of co-founders of frida are Ariane Olschak, Farah Saad, Marianna Mkrtchyan and Philipp Schmidtmayr. Ariane Olschak is frida’s chairlady and legal expert. She has a Law Degree from the University of Vienna. Ariane has been working in different NGOs dealing with Asylum Law and familiy reunifications, as for example the Red Cross, for the last four years. Before joining the Red Cross, Ariane had been the head of the legal department of Asyl in Not for a year. She is currently working at ARGE Rechtsberatung. Farah Saad has a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science as well as Transcultural Communication. Currently, she is doing her Master’s Degree in Clinical Social Work. She has been active as a volunteer in several organisations and fields, such as tuition projects for asylum-seekers and refugees, legal aid and projects for vulnerable women*. Marianna Mkrtchyan is also part of frida’s legal team. Born in Armenia, she went to school in Vienna and Brussels and is currently studying law at the University of Vienna. During her studies, she has gained four years of experience working as a legal advisor at the NGO Asyl in Not. Growing up in an international environment and studying as a foreign student, facing issues, such as limited access to the labour market, she provides an important insight for frida. Philipp Schmidtmayr studied Law at the University of Vienna and has four years of experience in legal counselling in alien and asylum law. Having not only worked for several NGOs, but also for law firms, he has gained an even broader insight into legal affairs.

Photo © Lea Fabienne Photography – View the press release announcing the 2020 cohortIf you were to explain Frida to a stranger, what would you say? Frida is an NGO that specializes in asylum and migration law. We are a group of people of different professional backgrounds, such as legal and social workers as well as translators, and we offer free and independent counselling for refugees and migrants. What might be surprising to some is that our clientele is pretty varied – we consult, for example, also EU-citizens, students or people wanting to reunite with their families in Austria. What was the initial feedback to your startup idea? We feel that people liked the idea a lot and also understood the general sense of our approach. We were also very soon confronted with questions in regards to our revenue streams, sustainability and recruiting more team members. How did you meet your co-founders? Most of us met professionally, though Marianna and Philipp were roommates before we founded frida. We got to know each other because each of us was working in different fields of legal and psychosocial consultation. Because there was no organization combining these different areas of law (asylum and migration law), we were already working together closely, while being employed at different organizations. We started meeting outside of work and became friends, and that’s when the idea of founding frida arose. What was the decisive impulse to become a social entrepreneur and, finally, a company? We were all working together before founding frida and were therefore very aware that there was no organization combining our different work fields. So the idea to start a new organization had actually been in our heads for a while. When the Austrian government announced that starting with 2021, funding for independent counselling for refugees will be cancelled and taken over by a quasi-governmental institution, we made the final decision to take action. Of course, the founding process required a lot of planning – we had to find an office, recruit more team members, set up a website etc. But the motivation was there and we’re very glad the idea was realized and the word about frida spread so quickly. What was the most helpful in your journey to becoming a social impact venture founder? Our team had absolutely no experience in founding a social business, so it’s been difficult at first. We entered the Social Impact Award Program in 2019, where we got to meet many experts on the topic, as well as many peers, who were also in the process of establishing their social business ideas. The program helped us a lot in terms of professionalization, as is the found! program helping us right now. A very important lesson we learned is to always get as many opinions as possible on issues we’re not sure on or experienced enough with and to always stay true to our principles and to who we are as an organization. As a social entrepreneur, what moments of your job keep you going? The answer to this question will probably be the same with everyone working in the social field: to see the impact you’re achieving with your project. Since most social businesses are non-profit– with frida maybe being even more of an exception, since we are not aiming to make any profit at all – making an impact is the motivation behind most of our projects. With frida, there is of course a lot of frustration that comes with the fields of asylum and migration, but we get a lot of good feedback from our clients, which plays a big part in staying motivated. Based on your experience, what legal issues are most common among the people you help? As said before, our clientele is very diverse and so are the issues that we help them to deal with. At the moment, a very common issue is that of status cancellations. In 2015, a high number of refugees came to Austria, many of whom now have international protection. For some reason, since around 2018, the authorities started to terminate that protection for many people and are ordering deportations. This is often not understandable to us as well as our clients, since the situation in their countries of origin is mostly the same as in 2015, if not worse. We support these clients in keeping their protection or applying for long-term residency permits – in these cases it has again proven very useful that we combined asylum and migration law, so we can offer them different alternatives. The found! program of Deloitte Austria and Impact Hub Vienna entered its fourth round this year. How did you hear about it? Last year, we were one of the teams to win the Social Impact Award, which is also part of the Impact Hub Vienna. One of our team members, Farah, went to the SIA Summit in Kiev, where she got to meet many other social entrepreneurs. She heard about the found! program there and got very positive feedback on it, so we decided it might be a good fit for us and frida’s further development. Your favourite moment of found! so far? We very much enjoyed the kick-off, because we had read about the finalists‘ projects beforehand, but were very curious to meet the members of the individual teams. As happy as we are about our mentors and all the experts offering their expertise to us, a big part of accelerator programs like found! is always connecting and learning from your peers. It was also one of the few times we saw each other in person, since everything is taking place online now, so that was much nicer as well! COVID-19 changed everything. How do you deal with the new reality? It does affect us of course – we usually have open consultation, meaning everyone can come without an appointment and just talk to an advisor. There is no possibility to offer that now. We are of course still reachable for our clients through e-mail and social media and we offer consultation via video chat in emergencies, but we would like to be as accessible to everyone as possible, so we are currently working on even better solutions. Since the COVID-19 measures have been loosened a bit in May, we can offer more appointments again and not just restrict it to emergencies. Thank you for taking the time to share the story of frida, Ariane, Farah, Marianna and Philipp! Good luck with the found! program jury event in June!

When erdbeerwoche became part of the Impact Hub Vienna community, they did it with a bang. Some members will remember the first reveal of the “Bloody Woman’ t-shirts <U+0001F609> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Menstruation & Monatshygiene <U+0001F353> (@erdbeerwoche_) on Sep 22, 2015 at 4:08am PDT erdbeerwoche is the first social business from Austria to specialize in menstruation with the aim of leading a change in the way society perceives periods and bringing sustainable menstrual hygiene into the mainstream. Just one year younger than Impact Hub Vienna, erdbeerwoche went from a period talk trailblazer to myth buster – and they continue to educate people in Austria on the role of sustainability and openness when it comes to menstruation. Dive into the impact story sent by the incredible co-founders of erdbeerwoche – Bettina Steinbrugger and Annemarie Harant. Impact is…Breaking Taboos While the ImpactHub Vienna celebrates its 10th anniversary (congrats, by the way!), we celebrate nine years of our company’s existence. Our social business idea grew alongside as we started dealing with the topic of menstruation, a topic considered a taboo much more back then that it is today. And it was nine years ago, in 2011, when we moved into a newly renovated Impact Hub Vienna. Menstru…WHAT?! At the very beginning, there was a lot of surprise on all sides: “What? You are dedicated to the topic of M-E-N-S-T-R-U-A-T-I-O-N??? And you want to sell organic tampons and menstrual cups??? Are you okay???”. Now, 9 years later, we have managed to educate millions of women; teach tens of thousands of young people; and replace over 7 million conventional tampons and sanitary towels with sustainable alternatives. In the meantime we are no longer looked at weirdly or smiled at with obvious pity or humour. On the contrary: the topic of menstruation has reached the center of our society and that’s a good thing! Founders of erdbeerwoche (from left to right) Annemarie Harant and Bettina Steinbrugger. Why “erdbeerwoche”? We are often asked about our name, translated from German as “strawberry week”. “Is it about strawberries?”, people as us. No. The strawberry week is all about menstruation. And because a company cannot be called “menstruation”, we chose a term that gave this taboo subject a positive meaning and, at the same time, ironically alludes to the countless terms that were invented to disguise the unambiguous and uncomfortable terms. Other examples being “Tante Rosa” (Aunt Red) or “red Ferrari”. We, champions of open conversation and menstruation, call terms related to menstruation by their name, but still: “strawberry week” is a door opener that 90% of people, who hear it, will no longer forget. View this post on Instagram #FunFactFriday : “Breaking taboos about menstruation ” is the message our venture @erdbeerwoche_ wants to shout out to the world. When being at a fair and introducing their chemical free organic female hygiene products a women stopped and seemed very interested. Without further ado she unwrapped a tampon and used it as a pendulum in order to find auf if it had the right energy for her! Luckily she approved <U+0001F609><U+0001F52E> A post shared by Impact Hub Vienna (@impacthubvienna) on Feb 24, 2017 at 6:37am PST There’s one thing that we noticed, namely: anyone who deals openly with taboo subjects also gets positive feedback. We noticed this in our youth work program, our digital learning platform READY FOR RED, as well as in discussions with “old white” men. We always benefited from our approach of clarifying facts and doing so with humour. This way most people we interact with or who come in touch with our brand can really start diving into the topic and many are really thankful that they have finally found a sparring partner in us with whom they can also talk about such “sensitive” topics. The ImpactHub Vienna in particular was an important support for us, because we found many discussion partners there who were very open to the topic. Investment Ready Program In 2015, we then participated in the ImpactHub Vienna’s Investment Ready Program, which helped us critically examine our corporate purpose and also to further develop our business model. A lot has happened since then and our core business has continued to develop. erdbeerwoche’s business model is now divided into three areas: on one hand, our education platform erdbeerwoche.com, which also includes our passion project READY FOR RED: a digital learning platform that provides young people with everything they need to know about menstruation in an age-appropriate manner. Here we cooperate with public bodies such as the City of Vienna as well as with companies that have similar missions and that enable us to do this educational work. For example, in every package of the Italian menstrual products brand Organyc you will find a free access to READY FOR RED. Our second pillar of erdbeerwoche is our online shop, in which women can find everything a heart desires to make their period purchases sustainable: from organic tampons and menstrual cups to our specially produced fair trade period panties. Last but not least, the third element of our business model is made up of our political work and activism. We have been campaigning for the reduction of the tampon tax for years (already successful in Germany!) and for more transparency regarding the ingredients of monthly hygiene articles. Our current campaign called “Periods for Future” is organised in cooperation with Generation Blue, the water youth platform of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism (Die Wasser-Jugendplattform Generation Blue des Bundesministeriums für Landwirtschaft, Regionen und Tourismus). The campaign is aimed at educating people about the correct disposal of menstrual products. So there is still a lot to do overall and we look forward to continuing along this path with ImpactHub Vienna!

The coronavirus pandemic has been a challenge none of us was prepared for. When the pandemic turned from news stories into globally enforced lockdown measures, the innovative network of social entrepreneurs at Impact Hub Vienna saw their income slowly dry out or disappear entirely overnight. We cannot let this happen. Social innovators solve social or environmental problems using a collaborative, entrepreneurial approach while making their businesses work. They build businesses that support the creation of a more sustainable, resilient, and just world. This network has taken years to grow and losing it right now is not an option if we are to ever reach the Sustainable Development Goals. We have established a Solidarity Fund to make sure that the livelihoods of the many social entrepreneurs that are part of our beautiful network are secured. Watch the explainer video to find out more about the Solidarity Fund’s story: How the Solidarity Fund works This Solidarity Fund is our COVID-19 community support response, established by Impact Hub Vienna, run with the support of impactory, and operated by our – new – charitable Impact Hub Vienna Association. Solidarity Fund is facilitating donations. Everything that’s put into it, goes to the Members, who have requested help. Solidarity Fund is an ongoing fund. The set measures and their aftermath will affect us for an unknown period, so as long as there is momentum (and donation), the Solidarity Fund will be live and operational. For every member who needs it. Anyone, who is a member of Impact Hub Vienna and requests help, will receive it. There will be no questioning nor challenge from our side. With monthly payout. We don’t know how much it will be, but every month, starting May, we will look at the amount received, take 60% of it, divide it by the number of requests, pay it out in equal shares, and take the other 40% forward as a first building block for the next month. Operated in full trust. Yes, every request by a member will be accepted. Yes, everyone will receive exactly the same amount. And no, there will not be any selection nor assessment. We trust this community to assess how much everyone needs and / or can give. More information about this initiative can be found here. Support social entrepreneurs in Austria Take action now and contribute to the Solidarity Fund As a network of people, who believe in every single person’s ability to make a meaningful contribution to a better future for all of us, we are counting on you. Help our Members continue inspiring journeys.

"272","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/07/30/urban-innovation-covid-19/","ImpactHub","How Innovation Leads the Cities through the COVID-19 Recovery","Covid-19 is changing the way we see everything, from the importance of scientific and media literacy to logistics. “The new normal”, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says, is here and it seems like it will be like this for a while. And while we continue to confront this global health crisis, Covid-19 exposed some extraordinary fragilities in our systems and infrastructures and we will need the help of governments and social entrepreneurs to recover and ensure resiliency in the future. Urban spaces had not been prepared for COVID-19 There were news reports about animals coming back to urban spaces. Venice saw the return of dolphins to the canals and clear water, both rarities because of the amount of boats in the city and its harbour. A herd of wild goats took in the sites in North Wales. Deer foraged for food in the abandoned streets in Japan. Not everything was as cheerful as the dolphins and sightseeing goats or as calm as deer, despite the damage they did to people’s gardens. Barcelona saw boar come down from the mountains, and everyone saw the video of the monkeys fighting over food scraps in Thailand. These stories highlighted our interconnectedness with animals in the urban ecosystem and the damage we have caused with our sprawling presence. Early reports and studies from environmental researchers seem to suggest air pollution wasn’t as problematic during the Covid-19 precautions. Maps showing the near disappearance of dangerous greenhouse gases from the troposphere over China were released by NASA in early March. The curtailing of global tourism, high production levels, and decreased road traffic all played a significant role in the rise in air quality, globally. In Vienna, people opted for more cycling and walking rather than taxis and transit, according to ÖAMTC and this trend has continued afterwards, with more cycle traffic on Vienna’s streets. And this will influence how we see travel, consumption, and cars in the cities as we move forward. People moving through the city to meet their daily needs also became a concern during the precautionary measures. The longer a person was out, the higher the risk of exposure, and the more likely they could pass the virus to others but our need to use greenspaces and be outside, in addition to purchasing food and other supplies, did not diminish. Green spaces and their use have positive effects on our mental health, even just seeing them, in addition to helping with the climate crisis and positively affecting other environmental aspects of urban planning, including heat management, resilience to destructive invasive species, and biodiversity conservation within the urban ecosystems. Community Mobility Reports by Google show a month-to-month increase in the number of visits to green spaces in Austria since March 2020. Supply chain management and logistics became vitally important during the Covid-19 crisis as we saw worldwide reports of food wastage in some countries and extraordinary crop damage in others. We were also forced to confront the reality of how our food is harvested by low wage workers brought in from countries suffering from economic hardship in Eastern Europe. However, other aspects of the supply chain were brought into focus as toilet paper and other necessities sold out across the city within hours of precautionary measures being announced. And while the panic subsided after a few days and stores were fully stocked once more, it still affected vulnerable populations within cities in the moment. Which prompted countries following in the wake of Austria’s decisions to impose different restrictions, enabling the elderly and disabled to get supplies needed earlier than others. And further, we saw the neighbourhoods, globally, which were the hardest hit were the most impoverished. This exposed an on-going class divide across the world. In Paris, the suburbs with the highest infection rates were the over-crowded, ethnically diverse, lower income areas which were home to the people who were considered necessary to work during the outbreaks – cashiers, security guards, delivery people. Which means, they are the people most at risk of exposure in their daily lives, compared to people who were able to work from home in suburbs in which it was easier to socially distance. And for some in these neighbourhoods, and elsewhere across the world, this meant job losses because their job required them to be there in person or required less staff during restricted opening hours. In the United States and United Kingdom, similar reports flooded the media. This has fuelled discussions across the world about racism and classism and how we can better support each other as we move forward, as humans confronting this crisis. We are still living through a global cataclysmic event. Our mindset and thinking needs to change to incorporate these lessons learned. Which means many cities and nations are adjusting their thinking on urban development, across a whole host of issues, from socially distanced green spaces to new economic models. Biking on the rise in the European cities Across the world, governments are having to rethink their approach to issues. Vienna was given the distinction of being the World’s Greenest City this year. Its myriad of public parks and environmental preservation areas within the city contributing to this prestigious title, and to its much-coveted Mercer ranking as the best city in which to live. Vienna’s thinking on green spaces has long been evident in its urban planning, always ensuring there are easily accessible parks and playgrounds for everyone to enjoy. In the months before the Covid-19 crisis fully hit, Vienna unveiled two new programs to increase the green space and lower greenhouse gas emissions: increasing the pedestrian zones in the city and greening building facades. The new pedestrian zones would take accessibility into account, which meant evening out the roads and cobbles to make walking easier for everyone and extending the boundaries. Vienna has started putting up vertical gardens on building facades and partnered with Dachgrün, a Vienna based landscaping firm which has a full product range supporting green rooves and vertical gardens, to make it happen. However, these were all decisions made before Covid-19 necessitated social distancing. Precht, an Austrian based architecture firm proposed a design for a socially distanced park. The park is to be installed in a vacant lot in Vienna. It features wide, winding lanes separated by tall hedges and gates which would tell people if walking routes were occupied. Parc de la Distance would enable people to take advantage of green spaces for their mental and physical well-being while taking in their concerns about the highly contagious nature of the virus. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has committed to a more cycling friendly city to ease concerns about the communicability of Covid-19 on public transport. She has run on environmental platforms before but has increased her efforts and commitment since the Covid-19 measures were put in place. Hidalgo imagines what she calls “the 15-minute city” where people are easily able to meet all of their needs within fifteen minutes of home on environmentally sustainable transport, so on foot, cycling, or public transit. Which means better access to food, vital supplies, and medical care for everyone within the city limits. Amsterdam is looking deeper and tackling the issue of overall economic models in its post Covid-19 planning. It will be adopting the “donut model” of economics, developed by Kate Raworth at Oxford University. The model is designed to help cities, nations, and states to thrive in balance with the planet. Her theory is described as “a breakthrough alternative to growth economics” by The Guardian. In brief, the theory uses the United Nation’s sustainable development goals to define the basic standard for everyone and everything, which is the interior ring. The outside of the donut is the ecological limit of the planet; the boundary we should avoid crossing to limit our damage to the earth and its inhabitants. The dough which forms the ring, the tasty sugar confection we all enjoy, and the part we can still all enjoy. It represents economic stability, meeting the needs of everyone, and ensuring the planet thrives. The model takes into account everything from economic disparity to building new infrastructure using environmentally sustainable materials. City officials in Amsterdam are hoping this new economic model will help them navigate the post-Covid-19 recovery economy. Redesigning shared city spaces for safety It is more than just the overarching ethos of a city that is affected, whether it is green spaces, alternative economic models, or accessibility. Urban environments are home to large buildings which house lots of people, whether it is in flats, offices, or hotel rooms. During the precautionary measures for Covid-19 people worked from home, people shared spaces in their homes for longer lengths of time with more people than usual, and normal hotel operations were shut down and some buildings were co-opted as a place to house residents in quarantine or as surge capacity for the health care system. Enterprising design firms have already put thought into how these spaces might look as the world restarts after 2020. The London architecture firm of Weston Williamson + Partners has turned their considerable talents towards reimaging work places and office buildings. Their proposal takes into account more people working from home and allows for rotating use of the office space which enables larger gaps between desks and open spaces for socializing while maintaining social distancing. They are proposing environmental measures like bicycle rental and scooters to enable people to get to and from work with ease and building wider pedestrian sidewalks outside of new developments to handle the increase of people while maintaining distance. The say it is a chance “to green a city” according to an interview in De Zeen, an online design magazine. They also make space for food vendors, testing areas, and open windows to allow better air circulation rather than relying on climate systems which recycle air. Another UK based architecture firm, The Manser Practice, envisions a new way for hotels to operate in the post-Covid-19 environment. Their proposal includes automated temperature checks at equally automated check-in desks. And it incorporates individual exercise pods in rooms with spectacular views and old fashioned dumb-waiters to provide room service to guests. Woods Bagot, the global design firm headquartered in Australia, has put their considerable effort and talent behind devising a split-shift flat. The moveable modular flat incorporates space for exercise, play, and work. It has three modes, day, night, and play. The design firm also tried to address issues in fragile agricultural supply chains by incorporating aquaculture gardens in its proposal. Space for Social Entrepreneurs At Impact Hubs throughout Europe social entrepreneurs have been tackling the issues brought to light by Covid-19. Impact Hub Berlin held a hackathon to discuss and propose solutions to the issues the virus presented in Berlin. Their hackathon will present a series of innovative solutions to political and business leaders from the over 1200 submissions they received. The social entrepreneurs proposed everything from medical alarms to apps to connect you with local services to avoid an Amazon purchase. Urban connectivity, sustainability, staying local, and social impacts were the focus of these entrepreneurs. In Vienna, Lenkerbande is helping people access bicycles through the sharing economy. Which was helpful, given the Austrian government advised avoiding public transit during the precautionary measures and there has been no decline in cycling in the city since, one only needs to look at the morning bicycle traffic near Schwedenplatz to see it. This innovative start-up enables people to fix their own bikes and offers tools and expertise to help keep riders moving. They also repair donated bicycles, making them road ready again, giving access to people who might not be able to afford access to the expensive cycling market. This focus on sustainability and social impact is what will help Vienna navigate the post-crisis world. Vollpension, the innovative social impact cafe who employs grandparents to make delicious baked goods, needed to find a way to navigate the post-Covid-19 restrictions for restaurants but had the added difficulty of a vulnerable population making up part of their workforce. They came up with and tested a new business model, which included time slots for reservations and a fixed price set menu. They also offered delivery options during the precautionary measures. These social entrepreneurs were leading the way during and post-outbreak. The solutions, proposed by cities and design firms, can only address so much. Which creates a huge space for social entrepreneurs to work in and innovate complimentary strategies. The myriad of problems and the fragility of our existence exposed by the Covid-19 crisis mean that cross segment and sector cooperation is necessary to solve the issues. In an interview with the World Economic Forum Sarah Jensen Carr, an assistant professor of architecture at Northeastern University in Boston, says that illnesses like Covid-19 and other historical outbreaks have galvanized people to work together to create safer futures, better environments, and more supportive social ventures. Impact Hub Vienna’s entrepreneurs know their city unlike anyone else. They have already proposed ideas and solutions to Vienna’s challenges, from the invisibility of the homeless to using the coffee grounds from local restaurants to grow mushrooms. We know these groups will be able to propose new ideas to help Vienna navigate the post-outbreak world while improving our environment and creating social impact.

Webinars have become one of the most popular modes of interactive events. However, hosting a webinar using your laptop webcam is not the most efficient way of building your brand when the sound quality is bad, the computer image keeps freezing and the internet connection keeps failing. A poorly prepared or reviewed event will mean that in the future your audience may not choose you again or worse – go to your competitor! How can you host a professional webinar and attract your target audience? In this must-read article you will find 12 expert tips from Matthias Gritsch, CEO of Austrian Webinars, on how to prepare and host a successful online webinar that benefits your brand. Dig in! 1. Keep your webinar title short and snappy People move through the digital universe with a short attention span. So the most important thing is to create a short and snappy title for your webinar. Put yourself in the position of your target group and try to choose the title that sounds most promising. The title does not have to explain everything about the event, but should encourage further reading of the description of the webinar. Do not use abbreviations or terms that your target audience may not understand. Depending on the content and target group, you can also choose a provocative title. 2. Choose the right time and duration of your webinar Your webinar target audience may have certain habits. You shouldn’t schedule a webinar for teachers at 10:00 a.m., as they will most likely teach. Avoid lunchtime. However, when you are looking to engage businesspeople, try to schedule your webinars in the morning. Startups or young companies regularly open for business between 9:00 and 10:00. If you want to target customers, you should aim to host your webinar to fit into their free time – between 17:00 and 20:00. Topics that require the full attention of your target group should be addressed early so that their mind is still fresh and ready to concentrate on more complex ideas. Think about a reasonable length for the topic. Sometimes it’s better to have shorter webinars but run them as a series of events. 3. Marketing your webinar is key As with any digital content, you should start promoting your webinar very early. Write an expert blog entry and share it on social media – make sure to include a link to your webinar! If possible, make a video teaser that creates excitement and captures people’s attention. Create an opportunity for your target group to share the video, the blog entry or the registration link in easy to take steps. Make sure you do some active outreach too, for example, post an announcement about your webinar to relevant groups in your community. Comment on articles or create an event page on Facebook. Don’t forget that e-mail is still the most effective way to get in touch with your target audience to make use of your mailing list or plug your event into newsletters that amplify your reach. 4. Set clear goals, measure your success, and collect feedback Before you put a lot of time, effort, and money into a webinar, you should set goals and be clear about what you want to achieve with the webinar. It doesn’t matter whether you want to win new customers, train employees or sell products. After the webinar, it must be clear whether you have achieved your goal, what you can do better and whether you have met the expectations of your audience. 5. Always invest in good technology The quality of your video and audio stream are crucial to capture and hold the attention of your webinar’s participants. Poor sound quality is an absolute no-go. Do not use the integrated laptop microphone, but invest into a professional table microphone. Get recommendations from professionals as to which hardware is currently recommended or borrow a mobile webinar studio with a camera, table microphone and light. 6.Take care of the camera position and pick a neutral background The webcam should be positioned at your eye level. If necessary, place your laptop on a box or put a few books underneath it. The background should be simple and clutter-free. Avoid sitting with your back to windows or other sources of light – they will render your video too dark and negatively impact the quality of the image on screen. Don’t use roll-ups with a lot of writing or distracting elements in the back. 7. Use interactive options One of the reasons why webinars are better than live streams is that the audience can get in touch with you and interact with you in a structured way. Make sure that your webinar structure is clear to all participants and tell them at the very beginning about the possibility of interacting with you, for example, via a chat. Allow enough time for a Q&A session at the end of the webinar or answer the questions immediately as they come up. When you do answer, keep your responses to the point and brief. Sometimes, there might be no questions at the end of the webinar. Always prepare the most common questions yourself to go through them in such cases. This often brings up further questions from the audience. 8. Record your webinar Record your webinar and send it to all attendees, including those who have registered but have not attended. Make sure you edit the video to include a branded intro and outro! 9. Test internet connection and speed beforehand Make sure to check your internet connection before the webinar to prevent any technical difficulties. Make sure to be plugged into Ethernet instead of using a WiFi connection – the latter is often unstable. Only a sufficient upload speed guarantees the trouble-free and high-quality transmission of image and sound. 10. Keep your presentation simple Don’t shower your audience with too much text or elaborate animations in your presentation. A common question from your audience will be whether they can get the slides after the webinar. You can anticipate this question right at the beginning by telling the participants that they will receive the presentation as a PDF via email after the webinar airs. 11. The best comes at the end The content of your webinar should be absolutely relevant to your audience. Start by telling your audience what to expect. A good tip is to announce something relevant or interesting at the beginning of the event telling the audience that you will be presenting this exciting part in the middle or at the end of the webinar. This will increase their interest and the participants will be most likely to stay until the end. At the end of the webinar, make a call to action / offer for your products, services or advertise your next webinar. 12. Hire a webinar professional If you want to hold a professional webinar, it is worth hiring a webinar professional who will advise, coach and accompany you step by step through the technology and software.

"274","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/08/26/what-are-we-going-to-do-about-fast-fashion/","ImpactHub","What are we going to do about fast fashion?","Fast fashion is wasteful. I know, it is a line you have heard a million times before (or seen in print in a thousand different iterations). The problem is, we still haven’t changed, no matter how often it is said or written. So, it bears repeating. Fast fashion is wasteful. Just so we are all on the same page, we are going to define fast fashion. The term is used by the fashion industry to refer to designs which capture current fashion trends quickly, inexpensively, and in mass quantities. However, most people outside the industry who use the term define it as “the rapid turn-over of low-cost garments in the global clothing industry”, according to Smart Asset in a 2018 article on credit card debt. This definition encapsulates everything from the design through to consumer sales and the one we are definitely using here. There are a lot of issues with fast fashion, many writers have tackled the subject, and BookRiot has a list of the most eye opening books on the issue. A lot of these books cover the human cost but there is an environmental toll to pay as well. In her 2013 book, Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion, Elizabeth Cline attempts to give readers insight into some of the cost impacts, “[i]n 1930, the average American woman owned nine outfits. Today, we buy more than 60 pieces of new clothing on average per year.” This is in part due to the decrease in the cost of clothing, facilitated by fast fashion companies and brands. According to the European Environmental Agency, the price of clothing dropped 30% between 1996 and 2018. Which means we just purchased more clothing. The True Cost, a 2015 documentary film directed by Andrew Morgan that focuses on fast fashion, is credited by many as one of the moving forces behind uncovering the realities of fast fashion production to the public eye. According to Smart Asset, people buy five times as much clothing as we did forty years ago. And in an article Cline wrote for The Atlantic, she says that Americans send 10.5 million tonnes of clothing waste to landfills every year, according to 2014 research. Europe is no different, according to 2016 numbers, the EU textile industry sends 16 million tonnes of waste to landfills each year. This number does encapsulate the whole of the textile industry, which does mean the manufacturing process as well, so the waste which comes from cutting the pattern is wrapped up in this number as well. However, before we manage to rationalize half the environmental impact away and place it firmly on the shoulders of producers, we need to remember that wasted fabric is also wasted money for them. They will stretch the fabric as far as it can go and cut as many pieces from it as possible. And this is just what gets sent to landfills. The textiles people throw away because their jeans have a hole in them or they ripped a t-shirt at the seams. But what about the stuff we donate? The things in the back of our closets from a couple of seasons ago that we wouldn’t wear anymore because the trends have moved so far forward or because our weight has fluctuated enough to necessitate the purchase of a new wardrobe. We donate them in the bins conveniently placed throughout Vienna or to individual shops. But given the amount of clothing we purchase it means charity shops and thrift stores can rotate out stock which doesn’t sell faster than a major fast-fashion brand. This has created a whole global supply chain of second-hand clothing. According to the BBC there is a €3.6 billion global market in second-hand clothing. In his book, Clothing Poverty, Dr. Andrew Brooks suggests consumers are unaware of the totality of their impact on the global environment when they purchase clothing from fast-fashion brands. His research shows that anywhere from 10-30% of donated clothing is sold at shops. The rest is sold to clothing recyclers and the global market. He details where several items of clothing end up, like donated dress shirts often get purchased in bulk by dealers in Pakistan, winter coats by dealers in Eastern Europe, and summer clothing in the clothing markets in Northern Africa, where they are suffering from an influx of surplus second-hand clothing. According to Patrick Grant, a prominent fashion designer and judge on the Great British Sewing Bea, “we have enough clothing on the planet right now to clothe the next six generations of the human race.” And that is a lot of clothing when you consider the exponential growth rates we are currently experiencing. There is also just straight up pollution and resource use as an ecological impact. The European Environmental Agency reports 3500 separate chemical used in the manufacture of clothing, with 750 of them being hazardous to humans and 440 being hazardous to the environment. Their research suggests that 20% of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry, through dying or other chemical processes used in production. Furthermore, the report states a production of a tonne of textiles creates 15 – 35 tonnes of CO2. In 2017, they estimate that each person accounted for 654kg of CO2 as a direct result of textile consumption, which really just means purchasing new clothes. And finally, we come to microplastics. Oftentimes, cheaper fabrics used in fast fashion are synthetics, like polyester, nylon, and acrylic. The European Environmental Agency mentions this in their report. According to an article in Vogue earlier this year, clothing made from synthetic materials are shedding these microplastics into the water when they are washed and the air when they are worn. And researchers are not entirely sure how much is directly related to the clothing we wear, yet, but the current estimate sits at about 35% according to research published in the Environment Journal. But it is probably quite a lot. Given that a WWF report, as detailed in The Telegraph, estimates we consume the equivalent amount of plastic to a bank card every week. Policy Progress on Regulating Fashion Industry This is a huge problem, and one social entrepreneurs cannot be expected to tackle on their own. Fortunately, the European Union is already making policy recommendations and funding research and task forces. With the backing of the European Civil Society Strategy and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, who has a make fashion circular initiative, the EU is taking steps to change our current ideas about the economy of fashion. The EU initiative RESYNTEX, hopes to create a new idea for a circular economy for fashion. They are currently billed as a research project looking to understand how to keep “post-consumer non-wearable waste” from our landfills and incinerators. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is throwing their whole weight behind the idea of circular economies and waste reduction. WRAP is a new initiative at the EU level which is designed to fight clothing waste. The program has some high-profile influences, from the Danish Fashion Institute, the British government’s Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), and significant links to the Ministry of the Environment in the Netherlands. According to the WRAP reports, if the SCAP 2020 targets are met this would mean saving “16,000 tonnes of waste (equivalent to over 1,300 double decker buses), 420 million m3 of water (or 160,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools) and 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (or the annual emissions of almost 250,000 cars).” In September 2018, the Danish government released their strategy for a circular economy. The plan aims to have businesses incorporate circular economic models into their business plans and manufacturing processes. This cross-sector, multi-level strategy represents the Danish government’s commitment to decreasing waste and wasteful practices by changing mindsets throughout the consumption process. And, from a policy perspective, this followed shortly on the heels of Sweden’s policies on tax breaks for repairing clothing and household items in 2016, which the government did as the first steps towards creating a circular economy. However, this idea of environmentally friendly clothing and lack of waste in the fashion economy has affected some high-profile brands. Patagonia has won the circular economy multinational award at the economic forum in 2017. If your Patagonia gear is ripped, worn, or broken, they will repair it. They want to help keep customers using their high-quality products for as long as possible. “Repair is a radical act,” their website Worn Wear states. Not only do they offer the repair service but they also offer blogs on how to extend the life of your gear and how to care for it so it won’t need to be repaired for a long, long time. Vienna’s Forward-Thinking Fashionistas Impact Hub Vienna’s social and environmental entrepreneurs are creating new brands which are sustainable and circular. If you want something fashion-forward and forward-thinking then these brands and initiatives can help you find a sustainable solution to enjoying fashion responsibly. Endlos Fesch – Vienna’s Fashion Library is the ultimate in sustainability. This pop-up library lets you rent clothes. Need a drindl for Wienner Wiesn’ Festival? No problem, you can rent one for €45 for the whole month. Need a ball gown? They have them. The founders say the library allows us all to enjoy our soft spot for fashion while keeping our environmental impacts low. MaMaMu and The Shirt System enables shoppers to mix and match various designs to create their own shirts. They have worked with artists to create a variety of eye-catching patterns which can be snapped together to make endlessly interesting designs from a few articles of clothing. Meaning your look can change but your ecological footprint doesn’t. Kindby takes the hassle out of buying environmentally friendly baby clothes when you already have so much going on. The birth of a little one can be stressful enough without having to think about how your choices for your baby’s clothes affect the environment. Every month, they put together a box of clothes from environmentally friendly producers in your baby’s size which are seasonably appropriate. They choose clothing made to last, so the next little one can wear them too. Fitico Sportswear makes all of their sportswear from recycled plastic fishing nets. They design their clothes in Austria and then they are made in Portugual. The brand is ethical from start to finish. “In all we do, we put people and planet first.” And they have you covered from head to ankles, with headbands, tops, jackets, and leggings. So, get moving with your favourite environmentally sustainable exercise and fitness clothing brand. Montreet offers so much to the environmentally minded consumer. From repairs and make-overs should the item be worn out or damaged to rentals of their clothing if you are a fair-weather climber or event only jogger. They use resource saving materials and processes to craft their fashionable sportswear and encourage consumers to purchase a single jacket to cover off every sport, weather it is climbing, jogging, cycling or other outdoor activities. New Drivers for a New Accelerator These brands all contribute to positive environmental impacts, whether it is through renting clothing or removing plastics directly from the oceans, they are all making consumers lives a little better and easing out minds. But these are well-established brands within the Impact Hub Vienna network. Some of them having been with us for years and we have watched them grow through accelerator programs and flourish in the new environmentally-conscious market place they are helping to shape. And while, they are doing their part and helping you to do yours, there are still gaps in the ethical fashion market. Impact Hub Amsterdam, supported by Impact Hub Vienna, developed a new accelerator program to facilitate new social and environmental entrepreneurs entering this market; The Fashion Accelerator for Better Business (FABB). The start-up accelerator is aimed at companies working in the Netherlands or Austria in garment production which incorporate circular economies and/or sustainability into their business models and planning and sell directly to the end consumer. This new program will be bringing new brands and entrepreneurs into the spotlight in a challenging market segment which must compete with the juggernauts in the fast fashion industry. Both Amsterdam and Vienna are placing a high degree of importance on sustainable fashion, according to the accelerator’s Netherlands counterpart, which make them the best places for new brands because of the high degree of government support for environmentally sustainable initiatives and companies. Environmental Impact and You Outside of shopping these brands and keeping tabs on the new developments from Impact Hub Vienna, what can you do? “Make and mend” is the term used in the Navy (notably Commonwealth of Nations navies) for an “afternoon off”. It is derived from the time of sailing ships when sailors would, occasionally but regularly, be allowed time to “make and mend” their uniforms. (Wikipedia) “Make Do and Mend”, which means fixing our clothing rather than throwing them out and getting something new. Patagonia offers the service at an international level for their clothing, and locally, so does Montreet. Patrick Grant, British fashion designer and owner of bespoke tailoring services in Saville row, recommends picking up a needle yourself to repair your clothes. There are so many ways to do this. If you were one of the many who took up sewing during the covid-19 precautionary measures, then you probably have learned some skills. This includes the new class of “Sew-Bros”. But if you didn’t, there are other options. The trend of visible mending is on the rise, everything from iron patches, sewn on appliques, and traditional embroidery techniques can be used to patch up a few holes and give your clothes a bit more longevity. This is an art form which used to be employed all over the world. Not confident wielding a needle at all, Vienna has a venerable tradition of tailors and dressmakers who can help you out for reasonable rates. Vienna has an excellent repair network which is featured on the European Union’s Circular Economy Stakeholder website. Or, if you happen to know a Sew-Bro or anyone else who has the confidence, offer a trade for services or teaching, just like in the repair cafes. Take conscious stock of your purchasing habits. How much clothing do you own? Do you need to buy more? Can you access a service for it instead, like Endlos Fesch? If you need to replace something, can you afford to invest in a piece you would rather care for and repair rather than something you would consider disposable? Is there a consignment shop or thrist shop option instead? We all need to ask ourselves these questions and more as we approach textile consumption. The waste is just too much to not. Pool wardrobes with friends. Sometimes, but not always, we need a suit. Sometimes, but not always, we need a ballgown. Again, Endlos Fesch and Montreet offer a library of options but what if you want something a little more permanent. My grandmother and three of her friends who were getting married in the same year and were all relatively the same size, purchased a wedding dress together. All four wore it. When my friends started having children, they decided to share the expense of maternity clothing. Sometimes closet swapping is a great way to refresh what you are wearing. No one in your office has seen your friend’s pieces. Hand me downs worked for us for years before, all of us in an older sibling’s clothing or something from one of our parent’s friend’s kids, we can do the same thing for us and our families and reduce textile waste in the process. Besides, pre-worn jeans are the best feeling ones. We are always looking for the best ways to help you create a social or environmental impact, either through our forward-thinking entrepreneurs or through savvy suggestions like the ones above. We are eagerly awaiting the new brands and entrepreneurs from the first iteration of the FABB accelerator.

At times, you get tired, you run out of ideas or solutions, and the world seems like a big pile of mess that you just cannot fix. What you can do, however, is look beyond your immediate circle to the wider ecosystem. There is a wealth of knowledge out there, obtained after much trial and error. Explore other stories and let yourself be inspired by them! One of the easiest (and trendiest) ways to do that is by listening to podcasts. The wonderful thing about them is that you can basically squeeze in an episode anytime and anywhere you want to. Whether you’re lying on the couch, feeling guilty about that business plan you’ve been avoiding, or you’re bursting with motivation during your morning run, you can just put your earphones on, press play and let the voices of the people at the other end of the recording draw you in. It will almost feel like you’re being let in on a well-kept secret. So, if you are on the lookout for high-quality options, here is a list of 10 podcasts every social entrepreneur should listen to. Most of them even have a touch of Viennese Schmäh and a number of guests you may have already met at Impact Hub Vienna. Future Weekly – der Startup Podcast! Every week, Daniel Cronin and Markus Raunig take a seat in front of their mics to discuss the most interesting news and developments concerning Austrian startups, technology and the future as a whole. The topics presented in Future Weekly range from the power exerted by tech giants to the explosion of e-commerce and even the more lighthearted TikTok dilemma. Needless to say, there are plenty of lessons to learn from these experienced entrepreneurs, especially as they engage in dialogues with their Rockstars of the week – the changemakers who have excelled at bringing about a positive impact. > Listen to the Future Weekly podcast Gründer und Zünder He shares his knowledge because it brings him joy – this is how Florian (Flo) Kandler, entrepreneur, book author, “pitch doctor” and the mastermind behind Gründer und Zünder describes himself. In this podcast, he interviews startup founders, experts and investors from Austria to give you an insight into how you can build fundable companies and ensure long-term growth. If you’ve kept an eye on our community, some of the guests’ names might even strike you as familiar: Ali Mahlodji has been featured with tips on how to understand innovation and prepare a good talk; and Michael Kowatschew, the creator of the Contract Tracing App Novid-20, has recently given some practical advice on how to put together a large team in a matter of weeks. > Listen to the Gründer und Zünder podcast Inside Impact – der Podcast mit Wirkung Produced by the Social Entrepreneurship Center of WU Vienna, Inside Impact – The Podcast with Purpose focuses on four main topics: Organizational Resilience, Volunteering, Impact Investing and Social Entrepreneurship. Each of them comprises analyses of trends, developments, the difficulties one might encounter when in charge of a social impact initiative and the qualities needed to change the face of the communities we live in. With this in mind, it should not come as a surprise to you that Impact Hub Vienna is well-represented too: Lena Gansterer, our Partnerships Director, was invited to talk about how and where social impact entrepreneurs can find support for their ideas (Spoiler alert: Lindengasse 56 would be a good place to start). > Listen to the Inside Impact – der Podcast mit Wirkung podcast Thinking twice This time, sustainability is the key word. Thinking twice, the podcast hosted by Sophia Ernst, sets out to motivate listeners to start their own sustainable business by finding out about the blunders that other social impact entrepreneurs have had to overcome and the lessons they’ve learned. Whether we’re talking about fair fashion, environmentally-friendly hygiene products or the fight against plastic spoons, there are plenty of stories and initiatives for you to explore. Our personal favorites? There’s no room for debate here – Claudia Bergero and Sara Falkner, the creators of the sustainable chewing gum Alpengummi. > Listen to the Thinking twice podcast There is a wealth of knowledge out there, obtained after much trial and error. Explore other stories and let yourself be inspired by them. One of the easiest (and trendiest) ways to do that is by listening to podcasts. Carpe diem Being in charge of a team, finding investors, handling logistics, generating an actual income while saving (at least a tiny fraction of) the world, all of this can feel quite stressful at times. What you may need in order to wind down for a little is for someone to remind you this: Carpe diem. Seize the day! Daniela Zeller and Holger Potye are there to do just that. In their feel-good podcast, they sit down with a variety of people from all possible fields to help you find balance and enjoy life. Plus, they happen to have celebrated their 50th episode with a guest we believe is particularly special: Perrine Schober, the founder of the social tourism initiative Shades Tours. > Listen to the Carpe diem podcast Die Ali Mahlodji Show Yes, we’ve already mentioned his name and you know he is a cherished member of our community, but there is a reason why he is thought to be such a good speaker – he can speak. And he can also make other people speak, asking the right questions and prompting them to share their stories. In his podcast, Die Ali Mahlodji Show, Ali engages in in-depth conversations with politicians, journalists, researchers and even teenagers so as to show you that you have the power to design your own future. In case you’re wondering, we recommend that you begin exploring this podcast with Episode 15, which features DariaDaria, the best-known sustainability influencer in the German-speaking area. > Listen to the Die Ali Mahlodji Show podcast beatframes Inspiration with a parallel to media and communication: this is what Maximilian Hecke and Matthias Neumayer promise to deliver by means of their podcast beatframes. Once you’re done dancing it out on the energizing intro tune, you will discover success stories from household names such as Rainer Nowak, Matthias Strolz or Julia Dujmovits. There are special treats for social impact entrepreneurs too: Episode 26 features Philipp Stangl, who explains why weighing up on your consumption habits is worth the effort and talks about his (mouth-watering) business Rebel Meat. > Listen to the beatframes podcast Startup School Radio We’re getting a bit nostalgic with this one, as the last episode hit the podcast scene 4 years ago, but trust us, it’s worth taking a listen. Startup School Radio was a weekly podcast broadcast from the very campus of the Wharton School in San Francisco. In the 49 episodes, various partners from Y Combinator took turns to discuss the difficulties of managing a company alongside startup founders and investors. At the time, some of the initiatives presented were just taking off, but now they are well-established businesses whose strategies you will definitely want to hear about! > Listen to the Startup School Radio podcast The Tim Ferriss Show The Tim Ferriss Show has been ranked the no. 1 business podcast multiple times, so there is probably no need to introduce it anymore. There are no less than 456 episodes teeming with knowledge from personalities such as LeBron James, Jamie Foxx or Malcolm Gladwell, and the topics put forward cover everything from supporting doctors during a pandemic to writing powerful books. There is honestly little more you could ask for from a podcast, especially seeing as many of the interviews are so open and raw. > Listen to the Tim Ferriss Show podcast How I Built This We thought we might go out in style, so we picked this podcast to remind you that, whatever problem your social impact business is devoted to, you are building a movement. Produced by NPR and hosted by Guy Raz, How I Built This is all about sharing the stories of the entrepreneurs that have turned an idea, sometimes even a mistake, into a brand many of us now know or use: from Instagram to Airbnb, from Canva to Zumba, they all started out as a mere thought, were pulled back by various obstacles and yet made it to the top. Who’s to say you are not headed there as well? > Listen to the How I Built This podcast Want to go from listening to podcasts to producing your own podcast? Together with zimtfilm and Austrian Webinars, Impact Hub Vienna has prepared a web conferencing equipment offer to help you take your events online! Now you can rent a professional online event equipment, including a webinar case that is perfect for aspiring podcast producers.

"276","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/10/02/frugal-innovation/","ImpactHub","How Frugal Innovation Accelerates Change in Austria and the Western Balkans","Frugal Innovation sounds like something your grandparents or great grandparents would say. They were children of the Great Depression and wars which left the world resource-poor and economically damaged. Looking around the marketplace today, we see a world ravaged by a global health crisis and two successive recessions a little over a decade apart. Consumers worldwide are looking for different and more affordable solutions for their needs. Frugal Innovation sounds like something we should all be saying and here’s why. Impact Hub Vienna defines it as an innovation process resulting in “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” In essence, this means Frugal Innovations provide radically affordable products to a large number of consumers in previously untapped markets. They require gaining an in-depth understanding of the requirements of the target market to provide a product or a service that is specifically needed, with quality and cost in mind. While these innovations must keep the needs of the consumer first and foremost in their development and sales, they can also have significant impacts on the environment. Frugal Innovation in Practice Austrian companies working with partner organizations have been active in the field of Frugal Innovation for more than a decade. Helioz, founded by Martin Wesian and supported by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), provides a low-cost solar water purification system to many households throughout the continent of Africa. The company got its start after Wesian suffered from cholera while travelling in Venezuela and drinking contaminated water. He started looking for solutions and found one which was inexpensive and easily deployable, solar water disinfection. Now his UV measurement device is used in households across Uganda and Kenya to provide safe drinking water. They work with designers and social scientists, at home and abroad, to ensure their products are adopted by the largest number of households in their target markets. It should be noted, not every solution in the field of Frugal Innovations requires advanced engineering knowledge. Bosnia Grows Organic has been leasing land from Bosnian families to grow organic medicinal herbs. The team cleared the debris from unused arable land and took soil samples to determine what herbs would best grow in specific locations. The project, also funded by the ADA, came about after Ivana Stjepanovic had a discussion with her sisters about returning to Bosnia and their memories of organic farming before the country was torn apart by war. The company aims to return the land to the families after the end of the lease, more valuable than when they received it; creating farmable land once more. The project wants to help Bosnia develop economically by providing help and expertise to support what was once a flourishing organic farming industry. And, with the help of Austrian organic farmers, they are doing just that. Frugal Innovation as the Answer to Consumer Demands for Affordable Quality Products In the current economic climate of high job losses and the threat of whole sectors of economies going under, Frugal Innovation can and must apply globally. In the article “Relevanz und Potenziale frugaler Innovationen für Österreich” the authors, Rajnish Tiwari, Stephan Buse, Katharina Kalogerakis, Jakob Scheitza and Cornelius Herstatt, as the title suggests, discuss the relevance of Frugal Innovation for Austria, from the perspective of selling to the Austrian consumer and abroad. Their example is older consumers and technology. “Many users, especially senior citizens, feel overwhelmed by the (avoidable) hyper-complexity of technical solutions. They desire simpler and more robust products, and see the practice of planned obsolescence skeptically”, the authors state. This statement applies to any consumer who does not want to spend money on the latest cell phone model, regardless of the size of the marketing campaign and has managed their fears of missing out. Other consumers “are utilizing frugal products and business models (…) there is a growing trend in certain sections of the society for voluntary simplicity and more moderate lifestyles”. In other words, there is an emerging consumer who would like to spend less and save more but still have access to quality products. And in still another case, there is the conscious consumer who wants something affordable, durable, and of high quality to last several years so they are not substantially increasing their ecological footprint with the purchase of a new product. It is through these consumers that the authors of this article specifically tie in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), “ecological considerations necessitate a significant reduction in the consumption of finite and depleting natural resources, globally. Engaging in frugal innovations, therefore, contributes positively to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals”. What does all this mean for a social entrepreneur, the SME, the tech-savvy start-up, or the subject matter expert? Well, it means new markets are developing both locally and abroad. Consumer profiles are changing and entrepreneurs from Austria and the Western Balkans are well-placed to break onto the scene with novel solutions, inside and outside their borders. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by ADA and FFG to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. Implementing partner Impact hub Vienna is organizing three online information sessions on October 8, October 29, and November 19, 2020, for organizations and individuals who would like to learn more about the project. Each of the three events focuses on one theme that was selected after a series of interviews with stakeholders from the Western Balkans and Austria. Join the online information sessions to learn about frugal innovation and its potential for the region, find out more about the project and funding opportunities, ask questions to representatives of ADA and FFG, get feedback on your project ideas, and network with potential partners in Austria and the Western Balkans.

So much so that the popular English newspaper The Guardian adopted an updated set of terms to better reflect the gravity and the urgency of the situation. Indeed, they are suggesting to refer to it not as ‘climate change’ but instead ‘climate crisis’ or ’emergency’. Emphasizing the myriad of evidence proving it, they are calling those who are opposing the human role in the process ‘climate deniers’ and not ‘skeptics’. Still, with an abundance of information about climate change’s economic and ecological effects, there is somehow an overlooked aspect of the current climate emergency: its social impact and the fact that it most affects already disadvantaged segments of the society. Many experts agree that those especially vulnerable to climate change are the people who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized. In other words, those same people who have least contributed to climate change in the first place. Numbers can help put things into perspective: according to Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index, 33 countries are labeled under the extreme risk category. 27 out of these 33 countries are located on the African continent. When we compare the risk levels on a regional scale the picture gets even clearer. Europe and North America are getting the lowest risk scores, 8.13 and 7.81 consecutively (10 being the lowest risk and 0 being the highest), while Africa (2.89) leads the high-risk-region league with a significant margin to its closest successor Central America(4.05), followed by the Caribbean and Oceania, consequently. Climate Change Vulnerability Index 2017, Source The contrast is stark considering that North America is home to only 5% of the world population but emits nearly 18% of CO2 while Africa, for instance, has 16% of the population but emits just 4% of CO2. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the citizens of the developed countries will be safe from harm or won’t be affected by the negative effects of climate change. Studies suggest that even in industrialized and wealthy countries climate change will reinforce inequalities within the society. If anything, this index proves that the burden and the responsibility to stop this crisis and find solutions to mitigate its effects rely mainly on the shoulders of the high- and upper-middle-income countries. Returning to our main subject, the social impacts of climate change can be better understood by analyzing various topics individually. The following paragraphs will cover the risks and challenges the climate change poses on: health systems, food security, employment, gender equality, and education. Health and Nutrition Besides the direct hazardous effects of climate change such as heatwaves, floods, and storms, it is also expected that it will inevitably affect, via more complex pathways, the basic requirements for maintaining good health: access to clean air and water, the procurement of sufficient food and adequate shelter and freedom from disease. It is indeed suggested by the World Health Organization(WHO), that in the long run, the greatest health impacts may not be from acute shocks of natural disasters or epidemics, but from the gradual build-up of pressure on the natural, economic and social systems that sustain health, and which are already under stress in much of the developing world. “To understand the kind of damage that climate change will inflict, look at COVID-19 and spread the pain out over a much longer period.” – Bill Gates Just like the COVID-19 pandemic we’re experiencing nowadays, the health effects of climate change are expected to be more severe for elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Children and women living in poor countries are also in the high-risk category. To draw attention to the ruinous effects of climate change and its repercussions on health, Bill Gates makes a striking comparison in his personal blog Gates Notes, between COVID-19 and climate change, and claims that it will hurt the poorest people in the world the most. He even suggests that “[t]he loss of life and economic misery caused by this pandemic are on par with what will happen regularly if we do not eliminate the world’s carbon emissions. Strongly connected with the subject of health and not less important is the topic of nutrition. According to OXFAM, a confederation of 20 independent charitable organizations focusing on poverty eradication, already 60 million people around the globe are facing a food crisis. Currently not getting the public attention it deserves, this problem is only destined to worsen in the following decades unless drastic measures are taken no later than today. For instance, droughts, as a result of extended periods of decreased precipitation, combined with other extreme weather events, are causing the loss of livelihoods and devastation of harvests, leaving local residents with a dilemma: leaving in search of other livelihood opportunities or staying and facing hunger. Another direct consequence of these events is food price spikes which are evident to have dramatic effects on low-income families and individuals on a global scale. Prices of some of the most essential crops such as rice, wheat, and maize are estimated to increase by up to %150 by 2060. Employment The negative impact of climate change on employment is expected to be on various levels. Once again, these effects will be particularly harsh for some regions and economic sectors as well as for some portions of the society. Both in urban and rural labor markets, extreme weather events are likely to cause job losses. As a result of this and assuming a global temperature rise of 1.5°C by the end of the twenty-first century, the International Labor Organization(ILO) estimates a global productivity loss equivalent to the loss of an astonishing 80 million full-time jobs as early as 2030. In terms of financial loss, this equals US$2,400 billion, an almost ninefold increase from the previous projection of US$280 billion made in 1995. ILO experts also underline the fact that this is rather a conservative estimate as some climate scientists even predict temperature rises by as much as 3 degrees Celsius for the same time period. The ILO report titled “Working on a warmer planet: The impact of heat stress on labor productivity and decent work” further suggests that the sectors most affected by the rising temperatures will be the agricultural and construction sectors as workers in these sectors are highly exposed to outdoor work. Other sectors highly dependent on natural resources and climate such as energy, tourism, and transport sectors are also to suffer the consequences of climate change. Geographically, the ILO report suggests that the most seriously affected regions will be southern Asia and western Africa, while European subregions are expected to experience a smaller impact. This inevitably brings a further widening of the inequality gap between low and high-income countries. Furthermore, ILO points out the high impact risks on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to their vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. On the other hand, the adaptation policies to reduce climate vulnerability may have the potential to create positive effects and stimulate demand for labor. In their guide titled “Adaptation to Climate Change and the World Of Work”, the European Trade Union Confederation(ETUC) brings attention to the benefits of the adaptation policies. These policies, according to ETUC, may contribute to preserving existing jobs and stimulate demand for labor and for new types of goods and services. Depending on the average annual spending on adaptation measures for EU countries, such implementation could lead to the creation of between 500,000 to one million direct and indirect jobs in 2050. July2014, Assessing the Implications of Climate Change Adaptation on Employment in the EU. SourceGender Equality The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges that disasters affect men and women differently on a number of levels, including economically, socially, psychologically, and in terms of exposure to risk and risk perception. (link) The experts, however, seem to agree on the fact that there is a need for further research on this subject and draw attention to gender aspects being generally neglected in international climate policy. Another important point to be kept in mind on the subject of gender equality is that gender norms and values are not fixed and evolve over time. This means the adverse health consequences resulting from gender differences and gender inequalities evolve as well. Women are often considered to be more vulnerable to climate change than men. Sometimes this is due to gender norms in a particular society that dictate acceptable behaviors for men and women. An example of this can be found in some Latin American and Asian countries, where women and girls are often not taught to swim for reasons of modesty, making their chances of survival in flooding disasters significantly lower. DW reports that, according to a UN Population Fund report, women and girls are 14 times more likely to die than men during natural disasters. In most cases, however, it is their lower socioeconomic status in the society that makes women more vulnerable. They make up the majority of the world’s economically poor, doing most of the agricultural work, bearing unequal responsibility for household food security, carrying a disproportionate burden for harvesting water and fuel for everyday survival, and relying on threatened natural resources for their livelihoods. Not to mention their lack of access, control, and ownership of these resources and their exclusion from important policy-making processes. Education There is strong evidence suggesting it is children who will be hit the hardest by the effects of climate change. In its publication titled “Our climate, our children, our responsibility”, UNICEF UK draws attention to the detrimental effects of climate change on livelihoods. Some of these effects, the publication suggests, may make it more likely that parents remove their children from school – and in most cultures, this will almost certainly mean removing girls first – so that they can work to supplement household income. Another possible outcome is that entire families may need to migrate in search of food, water, and employment, pulling their kids out of school. “Indian women born during a drought or a flood in the 1970s were 19 percent less likely to attend primary school when compared with women the same age who were not affected by natural disasters.” – Human Development Report 2007–2008 The physical harm brought by extreme weather events on the educational infrastructure is, of course, another challenge that needs to be addressed. ‘Climate change proofing’ of educational infrastructure seems like the most logical first step in that regard. Climate proofing is defined as, “(…) the explicit consideration and internalization of the risks and opportunities that alternative climate change scenarios are likely to imply for the design, operation and maintenance of infrastructure. In other words, integrating climate change risks and opportunities into the design, operation, and management of infrastructure.” in the UNDP report “Paving the Way for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure”. Local Perspective: Climate Change in Austria Since the mid-nineteenth century, records indicate an increase in the average annual temperature in Austria of about 2°C. Compared with a global increase of 0.85°C for the same time period and considering that approximately half of that increase is recorded after 1980, it is clear that Austria is among the countries most affected by climate change in Europe and also on the global scale. This is also reflected in Germanwatch’s Global Climate Risk Index(CRI) 2020 report, where Austria is ranked as the 10th country in Europe and overall 49th among the 183 countries that most suffer from the negative consequences of extreme weather events. The index, developed by Germanwatch, combines the impact of extreme weather events both in terms of fatalities and economic losses. Given experts’ expectations towards further temperature increases in Austria in the following decades, the already substantial economic and social impacts of climate change seem destined to grow. The Austrian Assessment Report on Climate Change, published in 2014, draws attention to this fact stating that “(i)n addition to extreme events, gradual temperature and precipitation changes also have economic ramifications, such as shifts in potential yields in agriculture, in the energy sector, or in snow-reliability in ski areas with corresponding impacts on winter tourism.” (link) The report also warns against the risk of significant increases in events such as landslides, mudflows, and rockfalls in mountainous regions as well as the reduction in surface area of glaciers in Austria. After Us, the Flood Illustrating the complex correlations of the climate crisis through photography and video, Kunst Haus Wien, which holds the honor of being Vienna’s first green museum, hosts the exhibition titled ‘After Us, the Flood'(Nach Uns die Sintflut) until February 21, 2021. Featuring 21 Austrian and international artists, the exhibition shows the ecological consequences of our growth-orientated economic system at the global level and highlights the need for urgent sustainable action. One of those artists is the young Iranian photographer Solmaz Daryani, who through her photograph series ‘The Eyes of Earth(THE DEATH OF LAKE URMIA)‘, ongoing since the year 2014, documents the vanishing of the largest lake in the Middle East with its repercussions on agriculture and tourism, of which many inhabitants of the region depend upon. Another artist, Angela Tiatia, in her twenty-minute film ‘Tuvalu‘, shows some of the daily effects of rising sea levels on Tuvalu, a low-lying island in the Pacific. This small island represents many others facing to be overcome by the rising sea levels, as people in different parts of the world continue to produce waste and live unsustainably, unaware of the severe effects of these actions on their neighbors in the Pacific. Also in the context of the exhibition, there will be special events such as guided tours, reading classes, and an open-to-public panel named ‘Future Talks’, where experts, artists, and activists will discuss the relationship between climate and various topics such as the economy, legislation, and fossil fuels. The Cure for Climate Change: Does It Exist? Luckily, not all predictions are pessimistic: according to the Austrian Assessment Report on Climate Change mentioned earlier, various scenario simulations show that emission reductions of up to 90% can be achieved in Austria by 2050 through the implementation of additional measures. This, however, seems only possible with what is described as a social-ecological transformation, a paradigm shift in the prevailing consumption and behavior patterns, and in the traditional short-term oriented policies and decision-making processes. An essential part of this transformation will be the establishment of new business and financing models, promoting environmentally sustainable development, and a circular economy. Therefore, the thing that is missing is not a cure for injustices and inequalities brought by climate change. We already have the cure in our hands. Indeed, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), contained within The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, already provides the blueprint for a prosperous and peaceful future. But instead, what is missing is the will to put theory into practice. A roaring pressure from the silent masses which will force politicians and big corporations to put things in the right perspective. The real question now is, whether we will achieve that before it is too late.

BauKarussell – a RE:WIEN 2019 accelerator program alumnus – was awarded third place in the competition. BauKarussell (c) OekoBusiness Wien – Frank HelmrichBauKarussell made it into three award-winning projects out of 73 submissions for the Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize 2020. During the pitching event, which took place mid-September, Markus Meissner (pulswerk; Resource Manager and head of BauKarussell) presented the social urban mining concept to a jury panel of European experts. BauKarussell was awarded third place and granted with 10,000 euros as prize money. ‘The Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize raises awareness of the essential role small start-ups play in making the circular economy a reality. The award shows that other experts confirm our idea,’ says Meissner. The award was announced by EIT RawMaterials. EIT RawMaterials (initiated and financed by the EIT – European Institute of Innovation and Technology – of the EU) is the world’s largest consortium in the raw materials sector. The competition was organised in collaboration with ICLEI, RREUSE and POP UP (Veolia), with the aim of finding top innovators working on new business models that promote the repair, reuse and sharing of products as an essential part of the circular economy. The ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) network https://iclei.org/en/Home.html promotes sustainable development at the local level; the City of Vienna is also involved in the ICLEI-led initiatives of the EU Commission, the “Big Buyers Initiative”. Taking this into consideration, BauKarussell shares common interests with the organisations of the competition and receiving the prize is all the more important. First place of the Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize went to Thrifify (digital second-hand trading platform for charitable organizations, Ireland), while the second prize was given to Tournevie (development of the circular material hub Tourneville, Brussels). The implementation of social urban mining requires strong partnerships. BauKarussell therefore invites project developers to consider implementing social urban mining in their projects. BauKarussell sifts through local social economy companies in the vicinity of the construction project and works with them in a potential analysis on how project development increases cost-neutral resource efficiency, promotes circular economy and, at the same time, creates important jobs for the disadvantaged groups in our society.

Especially within cities, the disposing of food, that would have still been edible, is a common concern. However, what if food waste could become a resource? Circular economy models promise that the loop of nutrients related to the food system could be closed and the cycle of matter can be partially closed, depending on the reuse of food. These circular models involve an enhancement or renewal of our current linear systems. Where do we start with implementing a resource recovery-focused approach? Begin with supporting local food systems as they have strong potential for increased environmental sustainability through nutrient cycling and waste reduction. Strengthening local and seasonal elements in short-supply chains, reduces storage and transportation times resulting in less waste and a lower carbon footprint. Austrian start-ups participating in the 5th edition of RE:WIEN, such as deli*MAT and Fine Food For Busy People are committed to making fresh, sustainable and local food more accessible, in quantities we need instead of overbuying; Bienen-Retter Honig is dedicated to organic food production and biodiversity protection; and 2nd chance cereal is giving unsold bread a second chance. Let’s Talk Numbers Approximately 30%–50% of food intended for human consumption is wasted at different stages of the food system, such losses might be due to storage, transportation, processing, packaging and sorting in the agricultural operation and on the market (Felicitas Schneider, Lebensmittel im Abfall – mehr als eine technische Herausforderung). Food waste causes around 8% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions and is responsible for 70% of the fresh water consumption. In Austria, up to 521,000 tons of edible food is thrown away annually. On average, the Viennese throw away around 40 kilograms of food each year that could have been eaten. These numbers show an inefficiency in the food economy, where the consequences are a loss of energy, biodiversity, natural resources, productivity and money, and not to forget about the pollution and greenhouse gases that are created as a result of these processes. The WWF views food waste as one of the greatest ecological threats for this planet and calls for actions to be taken, for food wastage to be reduced by 2030. What is Circular Economy and How Can it Help Manage Food Matters? Circular Economy applies the theory and principles from industrial ecology, which aims to close the loop of substances and materials to consequently reduce both resource consumption and discharges into the environment. Circular economy intends to optimize and enhance the systems by reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products. That which was regarded as waste – becomes a resource. Circular Food Management refers to the circular economy that is most concerned with the management of the food system. This involves the reduction of waste generated in the food system, re-use of food, utilization of food waste and by-products, nutrient recycling, and changes in diet toward more diverse and more efficient food patterns. Image Source: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation As far as we know, the loop of nutrients related to the food system can be closed and the loop of matter can be partly closed relating to the reuse of food, and the utilization of by-products and waste. To avoid food waste, all the different stages of the food system must be considered, and measures must be adopted by the producers, distributors as much as by the consumers. Urban Regions as Catalysts in Changing the Food System Looking back a century the amount of waste produced in Vienna was quite limited and stable, compared to today’s standards. Food was often kept for longer or reused for later meals. However, as times have changed, the world population is growing and more people are moving to live in the cities, the amounts of waste levels have been steadily increasing. The high proportion of the food that flows into cities is processed or consumed in a way that creates organic waste in the form of discarded food, by-products or sewage, endangering human health and leads to a loss in biodiversity. Cities, as core population, innovation and development centres, bear the responsibility to minimise food waste as they have the resources and infrastructure to do it. The rising population leads to a greater demand for food and higher consumption rates in cities, which our current model for managing food no longer fits. Every action is needed to minimize food waste. “Cities, as core population, innovation and development centres, bear the responsibility to minimise food waste as they have the resources and infrastructure to do it.” This contribution could start by supporting local food systems as they have strong potential for increased environmental sustainability through nutrient cycling and waste reduction. Local food is not only fresher, but more regenerative and balanced, as it combines local and seasonal elements in short-supply chains – reducing storage and transportation, while providing better demand-supply balance. Strengthening localized food systems is a significant contribution to food waste prevention, food security and sustainability. Austrian Startups That Embrace Food Circularity deli*MAT, led by Karsten Michael Drohsel and Irene Lucas, is a start-up that produces solar vending machines, which are placed throughout Vienna as street furniture, and stocked with products from small local food producers. “The daily experience of poor local supply with high-quality and healthy products from small producers made us rethink. Especially local and regional food providers are particularly close to our hearts, i.e. smaller neighborhood shops that have/have had a particularly difficult time surviving during the corona pandemic. We want to encourage local and national consumers to develop sustainable and social awareness and to support local providers and their shops in their everyday lives.” The project is framed by a comprehensive educational program, which Karsten and Irene are currently developing and doing in Sandleitenhof (16. district). Karsten Michael Drohsel and Irene Lucas of deli*MAT.

Our contribution to reducing food waste is portioned food and intelligent forecast AI models that enables us to learn taste patterns of offices. This enables us to minimize out of stock and overstock,” commented Stephan Haymerle, the founder of the venture. All food that is not sold is donated as portioned food to charity organizations. Kantines will throw away a ton of food every day to avoid going out of stock – we use every dish for our customers or charity.” If you like it sweet, you might like to support the regional organic honey seller Bienen-Retter Honig (behind which stands a large team of Marian Aschenbrenner, Nalini Basedow, Sophia Rut, Christiane Aschauer, and Martin Manyet) that puts their sales back into maintaining the organic honey production, as well as the protection of wild bees. Marian Aschenbrenner and Sophia Rut representing the Bienen-Retter Honig team. Photo by Lea Fabienne for RE:WIEN 2020Another way to contribute to food waste reduction is to give food a second chance like the start-up 2nd chance cereal does. Sarah Lechner and Michael Berger produce granola made from unsold bread to reduce land use, water consumption, emissions and improve food availability by reducing food waste. Sarah Lechner & Michael Berger. Photo by Lea Fabienne for RE:WIEN 2020“It all started one afternoon in late 2019,” reminiscence Sarah and Berger .Sitting together with our son Luca, playing a game naming food made from cereal, he claimed that cereals are made from bread, which was obviously not true at that time. Later that day a long forgotten line came up to our minds. Vienna is disposing as much bread as Graz consumes. Several months later we launched 2nd chance cereals in the Austrian market. The Granola is currently handmade in the 10. district of Vienna, while the bread comes from the bakery Geier.” The Future of Circular Food Systems Startups such as the aforementioned, are enhancing the current management of food and are working towards implementing resilient food systems, leading the way towards a change at the local/regional level. If we make use of food waste as a resource to grow food and understand it as a precious asset, we can cut costs, prevent energy loss and reduce the carbon footprint. Circular economy models show us how our current systems can become regenerative and more efficient, now we just have to apply those to innovate, to create a prosperous and optimistic outlook.

Ten years seems a short time, yet peculiarly long, when we rekindle all those memories of transformation, ideas that have evolved and people’s lives that have been impacted in subtle, amazing ways. To highlight one such transformational story, I had to interview Theresa Imre, the founder of markta, a quickly growing digital farmers market that combines the rural supply of high quality sustainable food from the farmers with the flexible urban demand created by us the chic and trendy consumers. markta was part of one of the accelerator programs (innovate4nature) at Impact Hub Vienna and has recently developed as a wildly successful brand through the pandemic as people moved to the online market to virtually shop for their groceries. This is an alternative option for the supermarket-goers; specifically to get their food fresh from the farm and a push towards a growing community of people who love sustainable food that in turn empowers the farmers. You can read more about story leading up to me discovering markta, finding out how we shared a rooted cause oceans away and my fun experience meeting Theresa in this blog article. I’ll directly take you now in this article to the venue, amidst the lively and chatty bars of the dimly lit and often chippering Yppenplatz square, as me and Theresa are sipping our fresh spritzers. Now hold on tight, Acio! The Early Days Stanish: So Theresa, where did this all start, why do you feel like you want to make an impact? Theresa: I was actually living in the countryside, living around farms and was used to how people produce food in a natural way. But that is just one part relating to my roots; the other part relating to my heart, my energy and my motivation is that I never understood why as a child I had all this education, food and everything while so many people did not have access to all that and this gave me a clear and naïve perspective at a very young age. I realized that I wanted to make an impact, and spend my lifetime with leading a change. That was my big motivation for being an entrepreneur and doing business. That is why I went to business school did business administration and then followed that with economics with the understanding that “I needed to grasp the structure at first and then I could change something, not the other way around.” A lot of people feel something in the world is going wrong, but not a lot of people have concrete actions on how to change that system. That is something that shaped me from very early on, that I always wanted to just make things happen. Photo by Anna ZoraPhoto by Pamela Rußmann Are you a careful person? (Almost instantaneously) I think a lot, I would say I am a thought-through person but not so much a careful person. “I think you need to try and fail otherwise you are not going to learn fast enough.” Talking about failure, who is part of your support system? Most definitely family, the closer part of my family. The tougher things get, even leading to certain parts of anxiety, the smaller group gets you. In terms of friends, I have a few, and you need that back up knowing whatever goes wrong there are these people out there. I love your urge to address problems, was there a reason why you chose this very specific cause among all the problems our society is facing? Food is just so easy for everybody to understand. It’s about sustainable consumption and how we shape our future when we are deciding what we consume and what we do not. Food is something that everybody has to buy, or grow or digest every day. We just have to have food! So in my thinking it’s a basic thing to start with. Food is so much easier for everyone to understand and also there is a big problem surrounding it and especially in Austria. Because of the big structures of the supermarkets and industries, many small family farms are not able to survive with the price pressure. Agriculture changed within the last 40 years. Farming was initially very family- oriented and provided for the villages locally. This trend however has been on a decline for example, in the last 30 years, the number of farms in Austria has reduced from 400. 000 to 160,000. That is when I realized, ‘Nay-nay-nay-nay we have to change something’. Big industries earn 80 percent and the farmers get 20 percent, and from a calculation basis, if a farmer sells an apple to the supermarket he just gets an approximate 18 cents, and there you can already see this big gap of difference. A farmer earns for the entire span of an animal as much as 6 euros sometimes, and all of the efficiency oriented approaches which the industry has been promoting has resulted in that the farmer has become the weakest link in the entire food production chain. And you are right there Theresa, the farmer is the weakest link in our society. It is great that your idea seeks to empower them. Going back to the early days, the starting phase that shaped you, who were the mentors supporting you? I worked in a business consultancy before, which helped me gain an insight into how other companies worked. I worked there for about four years, and that is where I learnt how you get have funding, how the business model is developed. We were specializing in consulting startups. That was quite a good start for me in my business career on how to set up a company. And both my bosses invested in me, in markta and that was something that has pushed me very often and I was quite happy they recognised my energy and my eagerness. Photo by Lukas Ilgner Theresa, what do you think is one thing your bosses would say about you if I met them.. I think they would be quite proud and they are fascinated about the network and reach that I grew. On the other hand, I knew that I needed a lot more expertise in management, for example, since I had never managed people, but that is something you need to learn on the way and on the go. I think your talent is a combination of what you bring to life in a certain way with what just comes naturally to you, how easily you can pick up stuff that is important to learn and understand, and how some other things should be done by other people because you yourself can’t do those things. So both of my bosses are pushing me in terms of management. So you’re still in constant touch, I find that invaluable, you apprear to have crafted your own role in markta… Yes we have a good board that supports me and of course there is my markta team. As a founder, I do the ping pong, managing the team, and thinking strategically with the board and other stakeholders. One of the other challenges I have to take up is financing that has always been a big thing especially in Austria and especially when you want to do something sustainable. Seems to me you’re a working link between the ideation and execution… I see myself as a communicator, I really believe that my biggest skill is communicating and talking to everyone on one level because at times it can really happen that sometimes I am at the farm with the farmers and then I am at Hofburg meeting the President on the same day. And this is also because women are lacking on panels, especially focusing on agriculture and IT, which are particularly male dominated. Impact Hub Vienna Days That’s true but it looks like things are slowly changing. So how did then Impact Hub Vienna come into the picture? They actually had a program called innovate4nature in collaboration with the WWF where the topic was biodiversity. Oh, where Lena Gansterer was part of the jury panel? We had talked briefly and she mentioned she coached and worked with markta. Yes and the nice thing was that five of the startups that participated received coaching and mentoring and that is what I did at Impact Hub Vienna then, when I was still in the process of developing the markta idea. We were still developing between 2016 and 2018, and through this program we had a lot of coaching especially in business modelling and finding the right finance partners. We had the concept of marketing and brand feel all figured out by then, which was in fact one of the first things, since that aspect comes naturally to me. I must say I do like the brand design appeal, it was also one of the first things I had noticed. Theresa, what was one thing probably different that you felt being in a place like Impact Hub Vienna with you being exposed a lot to the startup industry already… I know the startup sphere of Austria, this sphere is very often focussed on short term business modelling and an exit focus where everyone thinks I need to build up a bubble and somebody else is going to invest into that and things like that. At Impact Hub Vienna I felt that it was truly something much more on the ground, in terms of, “let’s really make some change” and let’s create business models that are not just there in order to gain more investors and make more profit. Impact Hub is really completely different in that focus. I think social entrepreneurship has a key role to play. And I think social entrepreneurship also includes environmental entrepreneurship. I knew about Impact Hub Vienna and I also knew about the workshops it was providing and it was very welcoming and open. Impact Hub is also welcoming people who are not in their programs because you can just rent a desk or be part of a program or in general just join certain evening events and be part of the community, for anyone who wants to be in that area. Photo by Stefan Diesner Right, and how was the growth of markta during this period because this was right after the initial development phase so there were newer frontiers to look at… I would say we did a lot of interviews at the farms and then we saw the chance with the digitalization of these processes. That’s where, even in the beginning, I already saw that my biggest impact would be, with helping those small family farms become more professional and have more efficient ways to sell their food. I felt like it was the empowerment of the farmers and that was the motivation for me thinking, ‘Hey, you can free all the farmers’. And businesswise it is a niche area: connecting farmers to people digitally… It is a niche area, yes, with the people involved. This concept involves the food that we all eat and impacts the way the farmers produce this food. And the people I met at the Hub, even though you are not closely working with them, like Lena Gangsterer, Christoph Richter, they just stick, they just have the same heart beat in terms of the direction it beats. In a sense, we are all there and we are all working on something great together. Lena did mention you as a “True entrepreneur”… What I understand, the mentorship in terms of the business to sharpen the vision and execution was an impact from the Impact Hub Vienna. Definitely as well, I would say we were doing the program and it made me refine my business model and made me question the small things. The real acceleration we had was during the pandemic. And something I learnt a little after the encounter with Impact Hub Vienna is that we met the needs of the producers and not of the consumers in terms of timely delivery, packing and nobody did this fulfilment in between. We started to draw concepts with 45 farmers to set up a fulfilment structure for farmers where we got funding from the EU for that and we built up an entire logistic system to enable our own fulfilment process and that was our big breakthrough. So we selected 100 farmers around Vienna and also for the special products, like bread and vegetables in a circle of 50 km, and we set up a system where all producers deliver between 5–7am in the early morning and on the same day we are packing the goods and delivering them to reach in the afternoon. I would say this is our biggest innovation with our just-in-time principle. A lot is thrown out in the evening in the supermarkets, and by proactively ordering from the producers, only what the consumer orders each day is harvested by the producers in the night. We only order from the producer only what consumers ordered. This reduces the huge waste that happens in supermarkets. There is this one statistic that Vienna throws away as much bread every evening as Graz actually needs. It is just cheaper for industries to produce more food and throw it away rather than not stocking and preserving it. That’s a good innovation, It sounds to me similar to what Uber tried to do in the automotive industry… I think Impact Hub Vienna provided me the metrics and tools in order to measure the impact, and that has really helped me. There is, for example, Werner Krendl, who told me about the impact framework, with IRIS from the GIIN that explains how you actually define and measure your impact because impact is such a vague word. So these are tools that really helped me present better in front of the impact investors as I got challenged with questions. Hat of Spontaneity with Theresa Hey Theresa, your documentary is going to air in a bit, how about a quick rapid fire? Yes! (And very exuberantly) Values and virtues from Impact Hub Vienna… Combination of ideology and feasibility. One thing you are grateful for… Understanding that I have so much to give, it fosters all my energy, I feel as a thankful child. markta in the future… Revolutionize the entire world food structure. We have a franchise concept, and we want to provide an operational logistics concept. Farmers are everywhere, we just need to connect them better. Role of a global network in going international… Definitely these structures will help a lot. Knowing all of this, is there anything you would have done better… Many things of course, thank god! Otherwise I would not have learnt. There are so many “this little thing” that I will do better next time. How you see Impact Hub Vienna… A nest you can get back to. Any questions on sustainability it is a go to place. Why the name ‘markta’? It is actually ‘Market’ in German, but sounds like a woman. It took me 8 weeks to think about the name. We had other names like pro-local before, describing what it actually meant. I was always thinking how it would work internationally, and really in the shower one night, as I was thinking that I needed something easy, and something everyone remembers, it hit me and there it was! It was initially for a woman who could as well be in the market and one who could represent us. But it is the many we stand for and not just the one and that is why now we have a picture of the producers to represent us. Do you value diversity in the company? At certain stages we had more people from all round the world than just from here, but diversity for me is not just where you are from, but also gender, which comes naturally as a woman in the business, and sexual orientation. We have a drag queen in our team and we are very transparent about it. Diversity also in terms of personality, I wouldn’t want employees who are all like me. Thank you for your time, Theresa! Photo by Jenn and The CameraThere are often times you’d hear about a good idea and then there are times you’d meet an idea and you feel somethings going to be changed because the people behind are willing to go the mile to make it happen. Approach is something that counts and as I was on the tram heading back to my apartment scrolling through the documentary of Theresa, I pondered this was perhaps the one thing that has driven Markta’s growth and I scribbled a note to myself to keep in touch with Theresa and follow Markta’s story and order my first groceries online!","October 27, 2020","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stefan-Diesner-1-600x400.jpeg"

This is a climate action slogan. A reminder that we have only this one earth. This perfect planet which grows our food, gives us water, and even manufacturers the air we breathe. This is it. And we are quickly destroying it. Plastic fills our oceans. There will soon be more of it than fish. Cities are so polluted landmarks are not visible any longer. This is our everyday reality and it isn’t getting better. Frugal innovations are inherently environmentally sustainable. Environmental concerns in emerging economies are fuelling more frugal innovations. Whether it is a product or a process, frugal innovation is changing our relationships to the environment for the better. Impact Hub Vienna defines Frugal Innovation as an innovation process resulting in “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” The relationship between frugal innovation and environmental sustainability is directly stated in the definition. If fewer resources are used to make a product or as a result of a service then, in some measure, the product or process is more environmentally sustainable. As Mathias Weichhart from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) said, using frugal innovation automatically makes something sustainable because less resources are used when focusing on the features that are really needed. This is a bold statement which also happens to be true. The scientific and sociological literature is actually very clear on the real and strong partnership between frugal innovation and environmental sustainability, it is even considered “straightforward” by some scholars. So, let’s look at some examples locally and globally where companies are using frugal innovations and increasing their positive environmental impact. Environmental Impacts Stemming Directly from Frugal Innovations Companies the world over, from global furniture giants to Vienna’s own local clothing makers are using frugal innovations. One of the easiest and most visible environmental impacts is waste reduction. It is measurable and visible. Frugal innovations help companies save money by reducing resources used and waste outputs. One of the best examples of frugal innovation in media is Ikea. The Swedish furniture manufacturer has been changing their packaging, products, and shipping processes over the last decade so that there are less resources used and less waste. One of the biggest changes and one of their most famous frugal innovations was the shift from the Expedit shelves to the Kallax. The Expedit was known for its square shelves and chunky frame. But that required a lot of wood for the veneers and chipboard construction. But it also needed a lot of cardboard for the packaging, which meant a lot of consumer waste. Ikea designers removed a few centimeters from the chunky frame, making essentially the same product (just a bit shorter and thinner). The thinner shelves enabled them to use less wood, which saved on material costs (fewer trees were cut down for the wood and to make the cardboard). Considering Ikea uses over 1% of the world’s wood supply, this is significant. But there was still more cost saving (and environmental impacts) to be had. Ikea was able to reduce its shipping carbon footprint as the smaller design meant more Kallax shelves could be shipped at one time. It is amazing the savings, both fiscally and environmentally, the reduction of a centimeter or two can make. Waste reduction immediately brings to mind consumer waste, like fast fashion and electronics. Circular economies are a frugal innovation and a waste reduction process. Companies can expend fewer resources fixing something rather than designing and shipping an entirely new line. And consumers get to keep a product they love and save money at the same time through repair rather than purchasing new. It can be difficult to innovate clothing. A t-shirt is a t-shirt, after all, the design hasn’t changed since 1898. So sometimes, it is about using frugal innovations to create new consumer services. Montreet, one of Impact Hub Vienna’s own, and Patagonia both offer repair services for their clothing. Reducing consumer waste by extending the longevity of products. Not a hiker but your company is doing team building on a trail? Montreet also offers rentals of its clothing. This circular economy approach is a great example of frugal innovation being applied to a business model. The service saves the consumer money and prevents clothing waste from ending up in a landfill. Environmental Drivers for Change Some companies start out with an environmental problem. Like Green Watech, Salma Bouagarrani looked at her home country and saw environmental devastation and a lack of clean drinking water as a result. So, she decided to do something about it, she worked with partners to create a low-tech and low-cost filtration methodology which uses materials from the region. The system is accessible and maintainable. It is used to filter the water for 10,000 homes currently and they are expanding. Coal is used to power sugar production in some of the world’s developing economies, and these countries are often the most polluted. The sugar cane is harvested and the leaves and stalks are burnt in the field to make the sugar more accessible. Then the sugar is processed in coal burning plants. The minds behind The Cane Trash Burner offer inexpensive (relatively) factory retrofits to enable producers to burn the biomass for production energy. The companies doing the processing do not have to purchase coal, saving money, and do not have to use it, saving the environment. Additionally, the biomass from the leaves and stalks is technically renewable as they will be continually growing more. While this process doesn’t eliminate carbon emissions it certainly reduces them significantly. However, sometimes frugal innovations can be applied broadly, from medicine to farming. AfroBodies set out to make a low-cost and low-tech diagnostic tool for physicians in remote rural locations. It would enable rapid diagnosis. However, what the company has is that and more. There was an added benefit, their nanobodies could be used to test pesticides and other chemicals used to process fresh fruit, easily and inexpensively. Too many or too few chemicals mean the fruit cannot be sold on the international market, which means food waste and environmental waste from land and water use. And the farmer loses income. If all the fruit can make it to market, it means less land needs to be developed for farming, less water is used, less food waste, and greater income security. The environment as a driver for change has led to some of the most flexible and easily implementable frugal innovations. These dynamic start-ups have changed the way we view innovation and their economies made frugality necessary. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in the Western Balkans. For projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from key actors and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, at €200,000 or 50% of direct costs. And there are further provisions for feasibility studies. Implementing partner Impact Hub Vienna is organizing a final online information session on November 19, 2020, for organizations and individuals who would like to learn more about the project. Each of the three events focuses on one theme that was selected after a series of interviews with stakeholders from the Western Balkans and Austria. Join the final information session to learn about frugal innovation and its potential for the region, find out more about the project and funding opportunities, ask questions to representatives of ADA and FFG, get feedback on your project ideas, and network with potential partners in Austria and the Western Balkans.

"282","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/11/25/entrepreneur-burnout-when-too-much-is-more-than-enough/","ImpactHub","Entrepreneur Burnout: When Too Much is More than Enough","It’s 2 o’clock in the morning and you are writing a press release. You have been up for twenty hours. And really, you haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since you launched your business. The endless worry, the never finished to do list, and the emails, which never seem to stop, all have you burning the candle at both ends and then adding string along the sides so the whole thing is a tower of flame. Everything to get your business off the ground, make your dreams come true. You are passionate about your cause. There are people you want to help but now it is all becoming too much. And you can’t bring yourself to care about the newsletter you need to send and it takes you forever to get to your desk to update your website. You start to think no one will read it and you aren’t having an effect so there is no point. Does this sound familiar? This is burnout. And you might have it. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines burnout as a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. They list three characteristics: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one’s job or feelings of cynicism related to one’s job, and reduced professional efficacy. Burn Out Amongst Entrepreneurs According to Jennifer Moss in her article “When Passion Leads to Burnout” for The Harvard Business Review, purpose driven work, the work which drove you to become an entrepreneur in the first place, is one of the sectors at high risk for occupational burnout. As she says at the beginning of the article, “do what you love and you will never work a day in your life” is the messaging we are exposed to constantly. There is even merchandise which says if we are passionate about helping communities, people, or the environment then it will never feel like working. You will do it all the time and feel good about it. But that is simply not the case. A 2019 study at the Vienna University of Economics and Business looked at burnout in Social Impact Award alumni. They found that more than 40% of social entrepreneurs in the program experienced some level of burnout with 5% having experienced severe burnout. Those are some big numbers in a small population. Some of our highest profile entrepreneurs have been speaking out against burnout for years. Mike Lanner, the founder of Vollpension and Gebrüder Stitch, said in an interview with Die Presse, “if you define your self-worth through performance and work, you will never stop working” and that he believed a lack of self-worth and wrongly learned belief systems about working drove him to burn out. “It’s not external pressure but mostly the pressure you create inside your own head.” Ali Mahlodji, founder of watchado, stated that the younger generations adopted old belief systems which perpetuate a culture not suited for today’s circumstances in an interview with Weiner Zeitung. “They feel overwhelmed in a culture that doesn’t meet their needs which often leads to burnout.” I can hear you start to object, saying you made your own culture because you own your own business. However, these two social entrepreneurs are referring to a pervasive idea of workplace culture. According to Moss, “burnout can show up when leaders equate long hours with getting ahead”, when you expect yourself to show up every day regardless of physical or mental illness, or when you have pushed your relationships to the side and are lonely. These are just as a big a risk for social entrepreneurs as it is for large, multinational organizations. Building Up to Avoid Burnout Social impact entrepreneurs want to make a difference. They want to help. However, new research suggests the only way they can do this is by drawing healthy boundaries. Dr. Edward Ellison ‘stresses that they can mitigate this “always-on” mindset by being aware of when passion becomes a double-edged sword. “If you are so inspired to do what you do, then you’re not necessarily good at setting boundaries. We need to teach people that setting boundaries is OK. It’s not selfish. It’s actually selfless. It allows you to be more effective at what you do, and to better [help] those you wish to serve.”’ Impact Hub Global has teamed up with other partners to create The Well-Being Project. The tagline on the website is “well-being inspires well-doing”. “We are catalysing a culture of well-being for all changemakers”. There are articles and webinars on well-being with a specific focus on entrepreneurial wellness. A healthy entrepreneur means a healthy business. Being in good mental health makes us more resilient, able to tackle new challenges, and lets us think through problems and find more solutions. The 2020 edition of RE:WIEN accelerator program (which is in fact its 5th cycle) incorporated a pilot wellbeing program in collaboration with the Hil-Foundation in the accelerator’s curriculum. The wellbeing-centred modules aim to drive a cultural change in the way entrepreneurs perceive, approach, and manage their wellbeing. Led by the theme of “Healthy entrepreneur equals healthy venture”, the Wellbeing Program teaches entrepreneurs the holistic approach of building personal strengths and resilience through a series of hands-on workshops. While the pilot is currently implemented only in RE:WIEN, the long-term intention is to include such training across all startup programs. What Can Individual Entrepreneurs Do? Shockingly, foster friendships. Go to board game nights, play video games over the internet, have a stitch and bitch, host a cookie exchange. Do anything to keep yourself connected to your friends. This is your support network outside your office and you need it. Nurture it and it will nurture you. Talk about it. The Schwab Foundation found that almost 50% of social entrepreneurs experienced burnout. That means one of the people sitting on either side of you at Impact Hub Vienna is either going through it now or has been through it. Talking about it removes the isolation and the stigma. It might also help you make a new friend (see the paragraph above). Make an actual work day. Set hours. Only respond to business enquiries during that time. This is part of boundary setting, which Dr. Ellison says is necessary. Everything outside of those working hours is meant to be for you. Time to eat, time to spend with friends and family, time to sleep, time for sport. This will keep you refreshed and ready to tackle any issues. Exercise. Take a walk in a park. Go for a run. Go hiking. Studies suggest that exercising, especially outdoors, can have a significant impact on mental wellness. Some researchers have found that outdoor exercising can help you feel more revitalized. Many psychologists suggest walking therapy as an effective treatment of burnout. Remember, a healthier you means a healthier business and a healthier community.","November 25, 2020","https://vienna.impacthub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Entrepreneur-Burnout-When-Too-Much-is-More-than-Enough-600x400.jpg"
"283","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/11/30/the-social-impacts-of-frugal-innovation/","ImpactHub","The Social Impacts of Frugal Innovation","The world is full of really great combinations jam and bread, Batman and Robin, and social impact and frugal innovation. These combinations are natural and the separate pieces feel odd without their partners. And while that last one is new to the list; we are certain you won’t ever think about them separately again after reading this article. The definition used at Impact Hub Vienna explicitly links social impact and frugal innovations: “high-quality, resource-light and affordable products and services in response to the specific needs of a target group. They address issues that are often underserved, through resource-efficient solutions that are affordable and easily available.” Therefore frugal innovations are, by definition, linked to positive social impact. The affordability aspect is what makes frugal innovation particularly relevant in the current climate. There is a high demand for low-cost quality products at the moment as people are confronting increasing financial difficulties due to nationwide economic stress and global events far out of their control. Large companies are reacting to increased demand in emerging markets, providing targeted and market driven solutions while keeping quality and the needs of the consumer foremost in their planning and development. Mercedes, Siemens, and Google have all jumped on the frugal innovation trend and their range of products and services in these markets reflect the quality the brands are known for while keeping their products affordable. But does this emerging consumer-focused methodology have the capacity for social impact? The answer is: yes. The Best of Partners: Social Impact and Frugal Innovation Social Impact is a nebulous term, encompassing everything from more inclusive policy changes to environmental sustainability. However, the accepted definition is the positive effect action (or inaction) it has on communities. These communities can be global or hyper-local. What matters is a pressing social need within the communities is addressed through inclusive means. When Mercedes Benz was looking to create a cost-effective truck for the Indian market, they spent time with truck drivers all over the country to understand their needs and design a product which matched. When Martin Wesian was personally affected by cholera while travelling, the need to create a cheap, efficient, and accessible solution for clean drinking water became clear in his mind, and so he developed WADI, which is now in use in Uganda and Kenya. Graggar Bakeries in Vienna helps disadvantaged communities by designing and building specific ovens to bake bread and consulting in the development of business plans to make the effort sustainable in the long term. So, what do trucks, clean water, and bread have in common? While these are all frugal innovations, they are inexpensive trucks, disinfection systems, and ovens. They are also so much more. They have massive impacts. In order to build the trucks for the Indian market, Mercedes Benz built local factories. Which have now expanded to manufacturing buses as well. Creating well paid and safe jobs. While these are still fossil fuel powered, they use less fuel and produce less emissions than their counterparts in the region. WADI and Helioz have worked hard to ensure clean drinking water is available in Uganda and Kenya, reducing the effects of water borne pathogens, like cholera, hemorrhagic e-coli, and dysentery. Creating healthier communities. Graggar Bakeries enables income generation and self-sufficiency in some of the most economically depressed areas of developing economies. They work with communities to design ovens specifically tailored to the area’s needs and resources, including fuel sources. They work with communities to develop business plans to support long-term sustainability of the local bakery and a community reinvestment plan for the profits. That is already a lot. Locally, Graggar Bakeries works with some of the most disenfranchised members of society, persons with cognitive disabilities. They provide apprenticeships as bakers or confectioners, enabling and empowering people. They work with Caritas in a number of countries, especially in the Balkans to provide support and programs. These are companies, through their products and services, with massive social impacts. From job creation to economic empowerment and healthy communities to reinvesting in development. These are the impacts every social entrepreneur strives to achieve. Solving a local issue using innovative processes and enabling people to build stronger communities and economic partnerships. Their use of the frugal innovation concepts enabled them to create products and services which the communities needed. Their targeted consumer driven processes mean their solutions were the most usable and meaningful. As mentioned before, it will be hard to separate frugal innovation from social impact. They are made for each other. New Funding Opportunities for Frugal Innovations The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets and through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by ADA and FFG to help organizations from Austria and the Western Balkans make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The political situation throughout the Western Balkans is stabilizing and the economies are growing. Austria is uniquely positioned, with traditional trade ties and a significant start-up eco-system, to partner with Western Balkans entrepreneurs, start-ups, and subject matter experts to create new and innovative solutions for existing challenges. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in the Western Balkans. The details for the funding packages and eligibility requirements are on our partner websites. But we have a quick summary here: for projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from stakeholders in the Western Balkans and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, at €200,000 or 50% of direct costs. And there are further provisions for feasibility studies. We know products and services developed using frugal innovation have the potential to make huge impacts on the economy and the quality of life of people who use them.

"284","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2020/12/10/innovation-vanguard-technology-and-frugal-innovation/","ImpactHub","Innovation Vanguard: Technology and Frugal Innovation","The tech sector is always innovating. Always giving us something newer, better, faster than the previous version. The sector spans everything from cell phones to industrial power convertors. We have better medical imaging equipment, smarter cars, and adaptive prosthetics. And the technology industry has been one of the first to adopt frugal innovation practices. Tech products are some of the most expensive items in our homes and pockets. Think about the technology you have around you, computers, televisions, cell phones, games consoles, tablets, cable boxes, and the list can go on and on. However, savvy consumers have started looking for less expensive alternatives to high price tag tech. And some companies are delivering, from industry giants to start-ups. Frugal Innovation in the Consumer Marketplace Earlier this year, Google announced a pared-down cell phone offering. The Verge stated, they “stripped the phone to just essentials, but gets them right”. The consumer gets a good camera and a decent battery life but loses out on wireless charging. For the €340 compared to other phones currently on the market, it doesn’t seem like giving up a feature we are not quite used to yet will have much impact on our daily lives. Google also did things like reduce colour options to only black and reduce the size options to make the mobile phone more cost efficient. Thanks to frugal innovation, which enabled better understanding of the features users want, Google was able to offer an affordable product which enabled more people in the cash strapped post-covid economy to access the technology which has quickly become vital to our daily lives. Medical Technology and Frugal Innovation Medical Technology changes as quickly as research allows. This market segment is constantly pivoting to meet the evolving needs of consumers around the world, from state-of-the-art medical imaging and interventions in cancer care to the basics of medical imaging for maternal fetal medicine in rural areas of developing economies. Each is equally important for this industry. GE Healthcare has worked to provide diagnostic imaging solutions across the spectrum of clinical needs, everything from complex cancer care imaging to basic sonographs. GE’s handheld ultrasound scanner “was specifically designed to enable earlier identification of at-risk pregnancies so that they can be addressed to reduce the mortality rates”. GE developed a product which “addresses key challenges in maternal care faced by emerging economies around the world” because of its thorough consultation with stakeholders and users. A competitive advantage, according to the Global Information Exchange. Their goal was to address the lack of medical care during pregnancy in developing economies. Women do not have the option of early care or, sometimes, any care “due to lack of access, shortage of physicians in high mortality, low resource areas, lack of tools to detect complications and make referrals, as well as high cost and fragility of typical medical devices.” According to Global Information Exchange, “Vscan Access overcomes these challenges via its simple and durable design, which provides excellent clinical utility at an affordable price.” Vienna is no stranger to medical innovation, in fact it has a long history of it, from the first steps to improve maternal survival rates in the 1800s through hand washing to some of the first surgical quality improvement programs. A local company is changing the way we think about diabetic care. MySugr, wants to “make diabetes suck less”. They aim to “improve the lives of people with diabetes by providing our users with a quick and easy solution to collect all relevant therapy data in one place.” They offer personalized coaching packages and interfacing and data collection from glucose monitors which empowers patients to make healthier choices over time. Rather than rely on expensive in person clinics with high overheads to offer their services, they went with the much less expensive service of offering care through video chat technologies. They took advantage of new less expensive technologies to create a better, more accessible patient-centered model of care. The side benefit to this is improving the care of diabetes in rural areas across the world, where care is not always accessible. This unique service and web-based technology is providing better access to coaching and education. Diabetes is on the rise, the world over, and developing economies are seeing steep increases. MySugr, and other services like this, make it easy to access high quality and evidence-based medical care. The app and the coaches behind it provide support to patients struggling with drastic lifestyle changes and education to make better choices; improving clinical outcomes for patients across the world. Frugal innovation in technology is helping health care providers the world over better care for patients and populations. Commercial Technology and Frugal Innovation The commercial technology sector is constantly evolving to meet the needs of consumers all over the world, whether someone is in Vienna or rural India. Siemens is perhaps the best example of providing technology to a specific market. They have used their own “SMART” approach, Simple, Maintenance-friendly, Affordable, Reliable, and timely to market. Felix Scheffler says, in an interview with The Guardian, “[i]n the past, perceived quality was more or less attached to the technological sophistication of a product, the highest number of features, [now] less is more. And this definitely calls for a huge change in mindset.” A great example is the power converters imported from Germany to China. They were deemed too costly and broke down frequently. This led to a perception amongst Chinese consumers that Siemens products were of a lower quality. An investigation conducted by Siemens found that the high level of dust pollution in the area was adversely affecting the products. They went back to the literal drawing board and created a simpler converter which malfunctioned less; because it had fewer features it also cost less. The decreased cost and increased reliability made the consumers happier, enabling a greater market share in China. Frugal Innovation, Impact Hub and The Innovation for a Better World Project These are stories of mega tech giants. They and their products are known all over the world. Many of us even have them in our homes. These companies have massive impacts on our daily lives. However, local companies are now able to access new funding opportunities. The “Innovation for a Better World: Advanced Solutions for Sustainable Development” project is here to help organizations navigate these dynamic markets through funding. The project is a pilot funding scheme on frugal innovation jointly developed by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency to help organizations from Austria, the Western Balkans and beyond to make meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. The funding packages are substantial for companies in Austria with working partners in emerging markets in the Western Balkans and Africa. The details for the funding packages and eligibility requirements are on our partner websites. But we have a quick summary here: for projects using innovation processes with significant involvement from emerging economy stakeholders and with a maximum cost of €150,000 euros the FFG is offering €75,000 euros for eligible projects through the impact innovation funding scheme. ADA has a generous funding package for eligible projects, ranging from €20,000 for feasibility studies to €500,000 for multi-stakeholder strategic alliances.

What’s a single person’s impact?“ Sure, we recycle our waste to the best of our abilities, and we board night-trains instead of planes when possible. Reducing CO2 emissions feels good! Yet, there is this constant lingering question accompanying us: „Is it enough?“ The answer certainly is unfortunate. While every individual’s effort is an important step in the right direction, this society and planet have reached a precipice. We know that change has to happen. We know that it has to happen now. But change has to happen on a larger scale, on a Corporate-, Asset- and Entrepreneurial level. Role-Models encourage us to see things from different angles, to leave the beaten path and maybe find an even better one. They are trailblazing and showing us that change can happen, even more that it is already happening. What started as a trend is now a movement. Entrepreneurs putting their visions of a better future in the centre of their endeavors. Corporates empowering their employees to initiate change towards sustainability in their daily work. And last but not least Asset Owners, increasing their investments in the areas of social- and climate impact. To support and bring recognition to those best practices, Mercer and Institutional Money have initiated the Money 4 Change – Impact Awards, which will be presented in four categories: Asset Owners This category recognizes asset owners who already have an increased focus/adjustment to SDGs and/or are making increased investments in the area of Social/Climate Impact and/or take climate risks into account in the decision-making process. An ESG process has long been established. Corporates This category honors corporates that use sustainable people management to help ensure that the people in the organization are treated responsibly and can therefore act responsibly themselves. The focus is on corporates that consciously encourage and empower employees to initiate changes in their daily work towards sustainability. Entrepreneurs This category honors entrepreneurs who have put their focus on Social or Climate Impact. With their innovative impact solutions they support the SDGs. Collaboration (Corporations which have a measurable, sustainable and positive impact on the SDGs) This category honors asset owners, companies and entrepreneurs who have jointly (with at least 2 of the categories listed) achieved a successful implementation of one of the DSG goals or jointly implemented innovative solutions. To be eligible for application, Asset Owners, Corporates and Entrepreneurs must have: Created an alignment with the SDGs (the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations) – having max. 3 SDGs in focus Implemented innovative ideas to solve climate/social problems and challenges Developed and shaped an impact strategy or process A (measurable) sustainable and positive impact on the SDGs Collaborated with each other and achieved one of the above mentioned (optional) The minimum requirement for Asset Owners & Corporates is a Membership of UNPRI and/or UNGC (or planned membership until May 30, 2021 or nomination of an existing member of UNPRI/UNGC to submit the award). For Entrepreneurs the business solution must focus on Social or Climate Impact. The call for application will be open until April 16, 2021 here. The jury process will take place in two stages: a pre-selection of the nominees and the subsequent final selection of the award winners. The Evaluation is based on the 5 Dimensions of Impact (IMP): Level of Impact: What change/impact has been created? What problem has the Asset Owner/Corporate/Entrepreneur identified and what was the solution? Stakeholders/Beneficiaries: Who has benefited from the change? Who is the target group? Level of Outcome/How much: Has the outcome target been defined and measured? What’s an evaluation possible and how? How deep/marginal was the change if measurement was possible? Level of Contribution: Was the contribution marginal or significant/innovative? Is the company a pioneer when it comes to the measures taken? Any other factors which have been supportive? How important is impact when it comes to the decision making process? Level of Risk: Has the defined target been reached? We’re there any challenges during the implementation/delivery process? The jury focus will lay on the implementation of the respective strategy/process/solution and the resulting impact. In April 2021, a short list of twelve finalists – three per category – will be disclosed. The three final winners will be announced at the gala evening during the „Institutional Money Congress“ in Wiesbaden on May 26, 2021. In addition, the winners will present their solution this year at the „Impact Days“ in Vienna. Meet the Jury: Institutional Money The leading trade magazine for institutional investors from German-speaking Europe also organizes the annual Institutional Money Congress with 1500 participants, and provides profound analyses and breaking news for their readers.

A striking number, but in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C (as agreed on by 195 countries in the Paris Agreement), a decrease in emissions at that scale is required every year of the upcoming decade. History tells us that emissions tend to bounce back quickly (like after the Financial Crisis 2008-2009). Failing to reach the 1.5°C goal will not only lead to harsh consequences for societies and eco-systems, but furthermore pose significant risks for investors. The Cambridge Institute for Sustainable Leadership found that substantial climate related losses in portfolio value could already show in timescales that are relevant to all investors, not only long-term investors. There is a growing consensus among leading investors that we are moving towards a low carbon economy, and it seems unlikely that the motor of economic growth will continue to be predominantly powered by fossil fuels. In fact, according to recent reports, the industry has reached a turning point, where ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) and non-ESG products begin to converge, and fund providers find it increasingly more difficult to sell non-ESG funds. European ESG assets could reach up between 41% and 57% of total European mutual fund assets by 2025 (up from just 15.1% as of the end of 2019). A fundamental change is on it’s way. Over a period from 2010 to 2019 ESG aligned funds already cumulatively outperformed traditional funds by 9%, with different analysis showing that close to 60% of sustainable funds delivered higher returns than non sustainable funds. With the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been increased concern that ESG issues would be set aside, but the resilience of ESG funds has been demonstrated even further, proving that investing in sustainable funds doesn’t come at cost, but can future-proof investments and boost returns. 88 percent of sustainable funds outperformed their non sustainable counterparts in the period of January 1 to April 30, 2020, shows a report of Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager. There is a fast increasing interest in sustainable investment, with a clear impact on the industry. With companies being put “on watch” by investors for failing to take climate risks fully into account, management’s risk being voted against at future shareholder meetings if climate risks are not addressed. Investor demand is surging, and leaving the industry with little to no choice but to become part of the change. Capital is allocated in a sustainable manner and more and more investors are turning to ESG. In 2019 flows into European ESG products represented 19,8% of their total AUM (in comparison to non-ESG funds accounting for 3,8% of AUM) While a majority of the European institutional investors are acting ESG-oriented, it is especially the nordic countries that constantly put Europe at the forefront of ESG investment. Norway is about to emerge as one of the world’s largest investors in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure within the next few years. At the same time, oil, gas and coal corporations are facing an accelerating divestment process, with Danish and Swedish pension funds following the Norwegian strategy. It is crucial that asset owners address climate related financial risk, while safeguarding the assets and pensions of future generations. 77% of institutional investors are planning to completely halt purchasing non-ESG products by 2022, contrasting only 14% of fund providers that plan to stop offering non-ESG products by the same year. While the retail investor segment is still lagging behind institutional, it is quickly gaining traction. With the Millenials entering the space and an increased public awareness of risks that are ESG related, investing for meaningful impact will be the core portfolio for many investors. Being at the receiving end of 41 trillion USD in intergenerational wealth transfer, Millennials rank impact performance as their primary investment criteria, ahead of return (according to a survey by the World Economic Forum). Individuals as well as institutions are looking to their financial planners to advise on, and to the financial services industry to supply financial products and strategies that align with their broader goals. Over the last few years a whole new set of client demands emerged, and many firms have been able to provide solutions and lead the green revolution.

"287","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/02/09/entrepreneurs-working-on-a-better-future-for-everybody/","ImpactHub","From the get-go: Entrepreneurs working on a better future for everybody","In recent years climate change and the importance of immediate measures to tackle the most fundamental issues of our time have reached a new level of awareness among people around the globe. More and more have become concerned about the sustainability of our beautiful planet, big movements arose and are urging governments and corporations for change. The time has come to work together and build a better future for everyone. An increasing number of corporations is integrating the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations into their business conduct. But it is especially the Entrepreneurs and their start-up ventures who often act as the channel through which new and disruptive technologies and approaches reach the market. With their break-through solutions they have an immense impact on our societies and the environment. They find solutions to problems once deemed unsolvable, and show that corporate success and working on a better future for everyone are not mutually exclusive. Sustainability is playing an increasingly important role, and the number of start-ups who assign their business purpose to the Green Economy or Social Entrepreneurship has been growing for several consecutive years. Survey shows that 21 % of German startups’ products and services make a concrete contribution to environmental and climate protection, and therefore classify as green. While those green startups have a significantly higher rate of female founders than non green startups, and they foster the participation and advancement of their employees at a much greater rate, they face much greater challenges in raising capital. In contrast, expectations for the business climate among green startups are better than their nongreen counterparts, and even much better than in the established industry. Green start-ups are surely no less growth- and profit-oriented, but in addition they create social and ecological impact. Paradeisa and markta are great examples of bringing local producers and customers together, and therefore avoiding waste, saving transport, storage and packaging, while also enabling fair prices for both sides. Did you know that chewing gum is made from polymers which are synthetic plastics and they don’t biodegrade? And yes, you guessed it: up to 90% of it is not disposed properly. Alpengummi has developed a new chewing gum concept that is also based on old traditions: A natural chewing gum, whose gum base is extracted from tree resin and beeswax. With fast fashion adding massive amounts to the environment, endlosfesch came up with the great idea to create Viennas’ first fashion library, renting out unique and high-quality clothing from young local designers. A small membership fee opens the doors to an endless wardrobe full of sustainably sourced fashionable items. The online platform WISR is matching companies with experienced retirees for project-based work, to preserve their knowledge and to help senior talents find exciting challenges and purposes. And then there is wohnbuddy, a great platform that enables flat-sharing between different generations. Magdas Hotel opened its doors in 2015, and is Europe’s first hotel run by refugees. Habibi & Hawara is an entirely private and independent incubator for future entrepreneurs, also a social training and integration project for refugees and migrants to equip them with an entrepreneurial tool Vollpension, an intergenerational coffeehouse, quickly became a fixture in Vienna’s vast coffeehouse scene. Pensioners prepare meals and desserts served by young people in a 60’s-70’s atmosphere. It is a place where generations meet, share stories and life experiences. Shades tours is creating jobs for homeless people to work as alternative tour guides, giving them an income and an opportunity to combat their homelessness. Their educational tours for the local community explain the multiple shades of homelessness, and present the different institutions that form Vienna’s social net. There is great optimism among green start-ups: 3 in 4 start-ups are expecting an improvement in their business situation, contrasting the more pessimistic expectations of non green start-ups and the general economy. From Renewable energy to environmental protection, from circular economy to reduced inequalities, with their innovative ideas and approaches, green start-ups are successfully tackling the whole range of the Sustainable Development Goals. They have a great sense for peoples wishes and needs in regards to more sustainable solutions in their respective niche. They show that entrepreneurial success can be achieved while actively changing the world for the better, and they prove every day that they deserve support, from governments, from decision makers, from asset owners and investors and from everybody that wishes for a better future for everyone.

"289","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/02/23/corporates-boosting-efforts-to-do-better/","ImpactHub","The times they are a changin’ – Corporates boosting efforts to do better","In 1987 the United Nations published their report “Our Common Future” describing sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 34 years went by, half a lifetime in 52 of the 193 countries recognized by the UN, and very close to that in many more. One starts to question how many businesses really tied their desire for growth closely to the aim of not damaging future generations prospects. Too little, too slow. The beginning of the negotiations for the Paris Climate Agreement sparked a new era of increased public awareness and activism. Through all age groups and walks of life, people are well informed and up to date on the pressing challenges that lie ahead. And people are increasingly willing to directly address the sources of these issues and to hold them accountable. “What have you done?”, young people demand answers from governments, corporations and the generations of their parents and grandparents as a whole. “What have you done to contribute to these problems?” but also “What have you done to prevent them?”. While the answers to those questions don’t come easy, the answers to “What next?” lie before us in plain sight. The UN set up 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), a blueprint to achieve a better and sustainable future for all. And while progress is already being made in many places, it needs advanced speed and scale in order to deliver the Goals by 2030. So with “Ten years to transform our world” they are proclaiming a Decade of Action, calling on all sectors of society to mobilize on three levels: global action, local action and people action. As of today, more than 12.000 companies in over 160 countries joined the UN Global Compact, which is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. Enterprises and Corporations are increasingly implementing the SDGs into their business conduct, aiming either for minimal negative impact or even positive effects on global (or local) environment, community, society or economy. A strategy that seems to come with significant economic rewards. A study by the public research organisation “The Conference Board” shows that out of 12 companies (incl.Siemens, Toshiba, DuPont and Philips) between 2010 and 2013 revenues from sustainable products grew at six times the rate of overall company revenues. Corporate giant Unilever has also seen brands that have integrated sustainability into both their purpose and products grow 30% faster than the rest of their business. The list of actions that can be taken to work towards achieving a better future for everyone spans across all fields of our daily lives: To end poverty, corporations can improve access to basic goods and services for people living in poverty, develop products and services tailored for poor customers, or invest in business-driven poverty eradication activities. But beyond low income, poverty often comes with limited opportunities and capabilities that can be addressed by recruiting, training and employing local community members. By the empowerment of small farmers and by the increase of agricultural investment, as well as knowledge sharing and rising consumers’ awareness, businesses can help to end hunger, to achieve food security and to promote sustainable agriculture. To ensure the availability and sustainable management of clean water and sanitation for everybody, businesses can prioritize water efficiency across operations by installing best practice technologies for water conservation. They can educate employees and consumers about appropriate water behaviors and the importance of water efficiency, invest in water treatment in order to prevent municipal treatment facilities to be overburdened by industrial waste-water etc. Corporations are taking urgent action to combat climate change, by sourcing all electricity from renewable sources, by reducing the carbon footprint due to greater fuel efficiency and local sourcing. They increase investments in innovation to improve the efficiency of their portfolios, and with the understanding of climate risk they build resilience into their assets and supply chains. Businesses strive to achieve gender equality and to empower all women and girls, with goals being sufficient participation of women (30% or greater) in decision-making and governance at all levels, equal pay and access to child and dependent care services. Zero-tolerance policies towards all forms of violence at work are implemented and an expansion in business relationships with women-owned enterprises is fostered. We are living in transformative times, and we know the direction. Step by step we are on our way, and more and more businesses and corporations are starting to acknowledge their responsibility, and to see that change has a big potential to lead to increased (financial) success. Mercer and Institutional Money want to support and bring recognition to best practices, and therefore initiated The “Money 4 Change – Impact Awards.” Presented in four categories, the awards will highlight Asset Owners, Corporates, Entrepreneurs and Collaboration.

With the current outroll of vaccines gaining traction, there is finally a sense of relief in the air, going hand in hand with an eagerness to finally push through and start to rebuild what has been shattered. Building back is one thing, but this time we should not miss the great chance to build back better. More than ever it has been made apparent that global partnerships and a strengthened multilateralism are core principles if we are to solve the world’s problems together. Governments, scientists, academia, civil society and the private sector, everyone needs to come together! Collaboration is key! Especially working with unconventional partners can result in breakthroughs that would not have been possible otherwise. We tend to have preconceptions on how something should be done, but it is diversity of thought that often leads to success. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set bei the United Nations is definitely not going to be an easy feat. Yet, what better objective than preserving the precious but fragile global ecosystem we call home? What better aim than achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone? Ambitious are the goals, and just as ambitious have to be the collaborative efforts, on global and local levels, in order to tackle the complex systemic transformations necessary to reach our targets. Great examples of successful cooperation can be found in the Circular Economy Switzerland (CES), a vast network of private companies and public organisations, fostering creative solutions and innovative initiatives and striving to transition the linear economy model to a circular economy in Switzerland. One of those initiatives is #movethedate Switzerland. Supported by the Promotion Fund “Engagement Migros” of Switzerland’s largest retail company, they started a movement committed to postponing “overshoot day” (the day we exhaust all natural resources available to us for one year) by promoting projects and companies that already prove that it can be done differently. Another great initiative is Make Furniture Circular. Over the years fast furniture has become the new normal, sharing the growing waste problem with fast fashion, while it’s components are even harder to dispose of. Make Furniture Circular is giving fresh impetus to the swiss furniture retail market, creating new futureproof products by design thinking, innovative business models and in direct dialog with suppliers. With an Innovation Hub in Amsterdam, the global initiative “Fashion for Good” is on the mission to make all fashion good. By sparking and scaling innovation, by offering practical action in the form of support, funding and roadmaps, and by fostering sector-wide collaboration rather than competition, they enable the daring invention and widespread adoption of good fashion practice. They work directly alongside the most promising Innovators, bringing them together with market players, i.e. brands, retailers and manufacturers, in order to make it easier for them to work together effectively, bridge the innovation gap and bring these innovations to the mainstream. These corporates benefit from our innovation scouting and screening capabilities, comprehensive technology landscaping and our hands-on support in piloting and scaling innovations. In 2018 they opened the doors to the Fashion for Good museum in Amsterdam, which tells the stories behind the clothes we wear and how our choices for those clothes can have a positive impact on the fashion industry. Cooperation has the potential to achieve impressive results. Companies’ increased participation in collaborative efforts is advancing awareness of social, environmental, and governance risks, but also awareness of business opportunities. Across societal sectors collaboration emerged as one of the defining concepts of international development in the 21st century. Partnership has grown from a response to the limitations of traditional development approaches into an essential paradigm in sustainable development. The financial, natural and human resources of our planet are limited, and it is time for us to optimize their use. At the fundamental core of successful cooperation is the ability to bring varied resources together and so enable better achievements. Increased value for all, greater sustainability, more impact! To support and bring recognition to best practices, Mercer and Institutional Money have initiated The Money 4 Change – Impact Awards. Presented in four categories, the awards will highlight Asset Owners, Corporates, Entrepreneurs and Cooperation. Today, we invite Asset Owners, Corporates and Entrepreneurs who have jointly (with at least 2 of the categories listed) achieved a successful implementation of one of the SDG goals or jointly implemented innovative solutions to apply until April 16, 2021 here. The minimum requirements for Asset Owners/Corporates are: Membership at UNPRI and/or UNGC Planned membership of UNPRI and/or UNGC until 30.5.2021 Nomination by an existing member of UNPRI/UNGC to submit the award Asset managers are not included in the category asset owners/corporates, due to the fact that as investment managers they represent an independent category according to the UN PRI definition. For the category investment managers, there is currently no award planned in 2021. The minimum requirements for Entrepreneurs are: The business solution must focus on social or climate impact In April 2021, a short list of twelve finalists – three per category – will be disclosed. The final winners will be announced at the gala evening during the „Institutional Money Congress“ in Wiesbaden on May 26, 2021.In addition, the winners are going to present their solutions at the „Impact Days“, an annual community gathering of professionals interested in mainstreaming impact. Held later this year in Vienna, 400 professionals working in innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment for impact across Europe are looking at what already works, and what still needs to be done for the transition towards the impact economy.

"291","https://vienna.impacthub.net/2021/03/05/education-and-social-impact-in-the-time-of-covid-19/","ImpactHub","Education and social impact in the time of COVID-19","We have been battling through this pandemic long enough to know precisely what the arguments behind the restrictions are and what effects we could end up facing if we do not stick to the current distancing measures: a healthcare system strained to the point of collapse and a string of ever-returning lockdowns bringing the national economy to its knees. At the same time, we know that the bigger picture is much bigger than this and that the pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on many more areas of life, one of the most important being education. It is of course too early to draw conclusions as to what exactly that impact will amount to, but the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has already warned that the COVID-19-induced learning loss may lead to the “Corona-generation” earning up to 3% less in the future, as the months spent at home are correlated with reduced productivity, which, in turn, affects skills negatively. And money is not the only issue. According to a survey carried out by a team of psychologists from the University of Vienna, most pupils reported feeling better or slightly better upon returning to in-person teaching, the decisive factor in this evaluation being the possibility to interact with their classmates and teachers. Given that the next lockdown could come into effect any time, this interaction is once again limited, so we can expect new dips in the pupils’ state of mind. The good thing is that we now know the drill, because we’ve already been there once. Challenges have been confronted head on. Lessons have been learned. But what kind of lessons? In order to find an answer to this question, I had the pleasure to interview David Schalkhammer, co-founder of SchoolFox, Lydia Wazir-Staubmann, trainer at Teach for Austria, and Rosa Bergmann, co-founder of Vienna Hobby Lobby. They have helped me gain an understanding of what social impact in the field of education looks like when social distancing becomes the norm. Cue the drum roll… Lesson no. 1 Quality over quantity is not just a saying. Least of all in education SchoolFox is an online platform that facilitates regular and distance learning. The app was launched in 2015 by David Schalkhammer, Stefan Siegl and Julian Breitenecker. Back then, they had no idea that we would be living a time when education would – albeit temporarily – move to the online environment, so the first two pillars which the features of the app were based on were Communication and Organization. “The system was very old-fashioned. We, as parents, were struggling to keep in touch with the schools and felt that some processes were not particularly transparent. At the same time, the teachers felt that they were wasting a lot of time every week trying to reach the families and plan events. Our initial solution was to basically bring features that we were already using at work to the school environment,” David Schalkhammer explained. This included the possibility to chat, keep track of absences, plan parents’ evenings, translate messages into multiple languages and the like. Five years later, the coronavirus pandemic broke out. “At the beginning of the first lockdown, we were shocked that homeschooling was happening, as this had been unimaginable before. At least in Austria. Luckily, we had already planned file-sharing in December, so we were quick to provide the feature. We also managed to incorporate a conferencing tool.” This adaptability served them well, as the number of users opting for SchoolFox doubled, and 50% of all Austrian schools ended up using the platform. Even so, when asked if there were needs that the team could not meet during the pandemic, David said: “Of course. This time we were fast with file-sharing, but it was a coincidence. If you are fast, the quality is usually not the best, so it is important to prioritize certain things. We now have a big community of teachers and parents, some of whom send very detailed emails explaining exactly what they need from us. We take their ideas into account, but in general, we plan at least one or two months ahead and try to make sure that the features we provide are relevant to the market as a whole.” In other words: Flexibility, yes. Hasty improvisations to the detriment of the users’ experience, no. Lesson no. 2 Digitalization is not a one-fits-all solution… Seeing that SchoolFox was pretty much ahead of its time and the team behind it worked towards more efficient digital processes long before the majority of us even considered having all sorts of apps involved in the education system, I wondered whether David – the co-founder of a digital tool – believes that distance learning can indeed replace in-person teaching. His realistic attitude struck me once again: “Going exclusively digital is not a good idea. We are social animals. We want to see and talk to other people. But it is a reality that learning and working don’t stop just because you leave the classroom or the office, so a tool like SchoolFox gives you the possibility to stay in touch remotely and be more flexible. That’s what we are aiming at, connecting people. We see education as team work, so we are teacher-oriented, parent-oriented and student-oriented.” Lesson no. 3 … yet digital learning should be an integral part of teacher training In order for the connection that David mentioned to work, the teachers also need to know exactly what strategies are best suited for remote engagement. This kind of knowledge can be acquired through targeted workshops, something that Lydia Wazir-Staubmann and I talked about. Lydia works as a trainer at Teach for Austria, an organization whose objective is to ensure that all children receive equal access to education regardless of their parents’ financial resources or educational background. Her task consists of supporting TfA fellows to become better teachers and effect change, either in the community or the system as a whole. When discussing how Teach for Austria dealt with the sudden need to provide digital training, she said: “We quickly put together training sessions on digital tools, which helped the fellows stay in touch with their students and give interactive assignments during the first lockdown. The challenge was to reach everybody, because many children don’t have suitable devices, they don’t have a quiet room at home and so on… It was important to mix up not just digital resources, but also things like handouts that the kids could pick up. We also provided resilience training for teachers and interactive live classroom training in order to show the fellows different methods of holding the students’ attention. It’s one thing for me to sit with you and talk, but that’s not how you keep the students involved during class. You need to use the chat, online whiteboards, polls, interactive documents that all of the children can contribute to live and so on.” However, acquiring such skills requires time, which is why Lydia believes that digital learning should be an integral part of the curriculum. Both at Teach for Austria and in ‘traditional’ teacher trainings: “We need to be more focused on this component. Instead of having one or two workshops devoted to it, we should make sure it is a fixed part of the program, so that both teachers and students learn to switch back and forth.” Lesson no. 4 Not everything went as disastrously as we may have expected… Despite the added responsibility that teachers had to take on, the conflicting messages that they have received during the past few months and the stress the children themselves have experienced, Lydia says that the pandemic had positive effects too: “We are more in the news. The gap is more visible, and the government has even provided schools with free equipment, which was never part of the conversation before. The fellows – and teachers in general – have also gained skills that they didn’t have before. That doesn’t go away. Not to mention that they were able to work in a more differentiated way and have more one-on-one sessions with their students, which led to some of the children blossoming.” Lesson no. 5 … and one way to make sure of that is to never assume what children need. Ask them instead. Education is not limited to academic performance. In fact, as Vienna Hobby Lobby aims to show, education should take place anywhere and everywhere. That is why the organization co-founded by Rosa Bergmann provides free leisure opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds: “Most of the children come from families that cannot afford extracurricular activities. The parents work a lot and spend little time at home, so the kids are stuck in an environment where they don’t get to explore their passions. We try to help them learn by interacting with others. Communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration are some of the most important lessons we share.” The activities meant to convey these skills range from kickboxing and street art to theater, drawing and yoga. They are also something that the most vulnerable children of all had to give up on during the lockdown. So how did Vienna Hobby Lobby adapt? “We put together a Buddy system, trying to stay in touch with the kids and help them with their school work. We also had a drawing challenge and a sport challenge, where they had to send pictures and videos. But we quickly realized that the children didn’t want more online activities, so we just showed them that we were there and took the time to plan for the summer instead. I think a lot of people want to help kids, but sometimes they don’t ask them what they need and bombard them with things that don’t really make a difference. It’s important to communicate openly.” Lesson no. 6 Even so, the idea that your education business is flourishing may not always be a reason for joy Something that all of the ventures I brought together for these interviews had in common was the fact that they have grown or that their mission has received significantly more attention during the pandemic. This, in itself, is not a problem. After all, awareness is key, and the more people gain access to tools or organizations that can help them, the better. However, as Rosa passionately pointed out, this growth also shows that the issues which the education system is confronted with may have been overlooked for far too long and reached a much more profound level than initially suspected. “During the past months, we have had a lot more time to focus on strategy and implement a pilot project in the 20th district too. At the same time, many parents spent time at home and realized how difficult it is to find suitable activities for their children, so we are now facing a demand that far exceeds our capabilities. People are paying attention. But it is difficult to see the kids struggling. Some of them are fine, while others have become shyer and more withdrawn. You can tell that there is fear and insecurity in their behavior, and we cannot help them as we would like to, because we have to keep our distance.” The Future of Education To sum up, the journey is far from the end, but the lessons we have accumulated so far are bound to make the road less bumpy. We can’t unsee what we have seen and unlearn what we have learned. Instead, we are pushing ahead – all the wiser.

The paint was still fresh, light bulbs were only being mounted as the guests entered, our clothes remained covered in dust, and lots of tools could only be hidden in haste behind doors or under blankets (after all, this is how it looked just three days earlier…) – and yet it felt special. A few years before, we were asking ourselves: In a city rich in opportunities, where does one go to make a difference, build businesses that better society and find allies, peers, partners-in-crime? On March 25th 2010 we finally had an answer and could say “We’re open” in Vienna’s first place for impact. A lot has happened since: An amazing community grew, countless connections – likely and unlikely – were created, start-ups on all issues that matter were born and scaled, three more floors added, our network expanded to cities all around the world, and a lot more. We started this journey as a group of friends, three of us stepping forward as founders. We never expected otherwise but are still proud to say: no one has left, and many more have joined. Leadership batons were passed throughout the years, and we are more than set for many more years of increased impact: Eager to give our all to create a more just, resilient and sustainable future. So here is to renewed commitments, amazing opportunities, and with immense gratitude for inspiring experiences everyday!

It made us rethink our routines, slowed down or even paused activities, maybe forced us to make shifts and in the best case find silver linings. But let’s also take the current situation as a wake-up call for one of society’s biggest challenges ahead: climate change, which won’t be over soon and cannot just be fixed with a vaccine. So here is to the climate entrepreneurs. To mitigate the devastating effects we need entrepreneurs who are driven by a desire to change the world for the better and create solutions for a greener future. We believe that startups’ innovative power is a valuable resource in the development of sustainable concepts. Especially so if connected to leading city departments and corporations committed to addressing the problems at scale, and together. Let’s fix this together! With the new Clean Cities ClimAccelerator, Impact Hub Vienna together with the Polytechnical University of Madrid, backed by the EIT Climate KIC and working with the program partner Wien Energie and many other challenges owners have created an Accelerator that focuses on the ecological and social challenges of cities, all over Europe. Now is the time for startups to join this journey towards cities with a carbon-neutral future. The Clean Cities ClimAccelerator is an EU-wide acceleration program that aims to support 30 climate-focused startups with over EUR 400K in grants and a state-of-the-art program. We are looking for startups developing solutions focused on the transformation towards climate neutrality, across all city systems – from mobility to waste, from energy to health, and the built environment. The accelerator offers a 9 month mentoring and coaching program with international experts, and up to EUR 25,000 in grants per startup – applications are open until May 16th on: www.cleancities.network Built on the ecosystems developed within the Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities of the City of Vienna and the City of Madrid is focusing on actual challenges of the respective cities.
