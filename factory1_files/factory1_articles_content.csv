"3","https://www.trendingtopics.at/factory-1-post-acceleration-kapsch/","Factory1","Corporates & Startups: How to Avoid Mistakes in The Post-Acceleration Phase","Factory1 is one of the most popular examples of a corporate startup accelerator in Europe. The second Factory1 edition led to two partnerships between startups and the Austrian company Kapsch TrafficCom. Still, several stumbling blocks to promising corporate-startup partnerships are bound to come up in the post-acceleration phase: conflict with existing business, lack of buy-in from decision makers, and insufficient resources. In a new whitepaper, Kapsch is reflecting on the lessons learned from the accelerator, which can be downloaded here for free. The whitepaper shows five ways on how to keep corporate-startup collaborations going during the post-acceleration phase. In this interview, Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1, explains what the post-acceleration gap is, how to avoid mistakes and how important commitment to long term partnerships is. What is the post-acceleration gap? Simrit Sandhu: We can all acknowledge that large corporates like Kapsch and small startups are highly complementary in many aspects. We as a corporation get support in search for innovation and our startups receive help to improve their execution. Despite the mutual interest and complementary assets, we have faced several barriers in successfully collaborating. It is a fact that diverse ways of working and cultural differences make us distinctly different organizations. The pace and intensity of the Factory1 program requires tremendous efforts and focus from all stakeholders involved. Within these 4 months, many rules and structures don’t apply to us. After the accelerator though, corporate mentors are likely to return to their daily jobs and the priorities of our startups might shift as well. The post-acceleration gap is essentially what we call the divergence in working styles of Kapsch and our startups after the demo day. Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1, on stage. © KapschWhat are the most common mistakes that happen in the post acceleration phase? One of the mistakes that is made during the program and has strong implications in the post acceleration phase is not linking the startup to the right stakeholders within and outside of the organization. We are therefore very thoughtful in setting up various touch point throughout the Factory1 program, introducing the startups to Kapsch executives, managers and experts. Another risk is fading interest after the demo day in the collaboration. Building up a business opportunity and losing focus and drive after the demo day can happen very quickly. It is one of the major pitfalls that comes with the post acceleration gap and a mistake we are trying to prevent at all costs. But after putting an enormous amount of effort, time and financial resources into an acceleration program like Factory1, the most painful mistake would be to completely lose touch with the startups. Keeping at least some level of connection can bring valuable insights int future developments on both sides and potential business opportunities down the road. How can these mistakes be avoided? How do you prevent drop-offs? We have worked out two approaches to avoid a fading connection with our Factory1 startups. First, we involved the business unit managers right from the start which eliminated the need for an actual hand over from the accelerator management team to the business after the acceleration phase. The business units took ownership by defining the search fields for the program and appointing Kapsch mentors for each area. Second, we empowerd the Kapsch mentors as relationship owners and as the main startup collaboration contact for the acceleration phase and after. They walk with the startup from start to finish and beyond. The main problem we tried to avoid was having to internally “sell” the startup-project after it has already been proven successful in the acceleration program. From our experience, that’s the moment when the collaboration collapses. But having driven Kapsch mentors guiding the startup through the organizational complexities has proven to be incredibly important. After the accelerator, corporates and startups are likely to return to their daily business. How can they keep on working together? For our second edition of Factory1, we took an active interest in the progress of the collaboration, rather than relying on requests from either our business units or the startups for continued conversations. We held biweekly update calls with the startups and internal stakeholders who might benefit from the startup’s solution. Introducing our startups to many internal stakeholders beyond the program helps them to reduce the dependency on their mentor and should give an insight to the complex corporate decision-making processes. What was your biggest learning from the Factory1 post acceleration phase? It is essential to clearly define which corporate relationship helps the projects current trajectory. In our case, we place a strong focus on generating interest from first customers in order to get the required support from all inhouse stakeholders. Luckily our startups are very proactive when it comes to getting exposure and suggesting customer development opportunities to us. In the end, both us and the startups gear all efforts towards taking the next step on our journey to a long term strategic partnership.","06.

In Silicon Valley it’s The Other Way Round.","„If you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair”, sang Scott McKenzie in 1967. If the famous song would have been written today, the lyrics probably would say: “Be sure to pitch your startup idea.” San Francisco and Silicon Valley are the epicenter of global innovation. Nowhere else in the world you can find such density of startups, VCs and large tech companies. The five startups from this year’s cohort of Factory1, the corporate accelerator of the Austrian tech company Kapsch, got the chance to spend one week in the Bay Area to visit tech giants like Apple, Google or Facebook, to meet and chat with VCs like Autotech Ventures and to feel the spirit of the University of Stanford, where the founders of Google, Intel, Paypal or Cisco have studied. The Factory1 delegation at the gates of Stanford. © Factory1Network effects “The size and scale of everything is impressive. It is like Europe, but you have to add a zero to everything,” says David Gugelmann, CEO and founder of cybersecurity startup Exeon Analytics from Switzerland. Together with the founders of Aerostate from Russia, Bestmile from Switzerland, DerQ from the United Arab Emirates and ObjectBox from Germany, he took part in a dense acceleration week. The goal: establish contacts in Silicon Valley, evaluate the US market and learn from the biggest startup ecosystem in the world. “I’m a huge fan of not over-estimating Silicon Valley,” says Vivien Dollinger, CEO of Objectbox, which provides an edge database for IoT devices. But arriving in San Francisco, she seamlessly got introduced to the very open culture. “I expected to drink a coffee and just run into a VC. You always hear stories like that. And I really met some people that way,” says Vivien. The Factory1 delegation visits Facebook. © Factory1The show must go on After meeting experts like Friedrich Prinz, professor at Stanford, the startup founders of Factory1 got deep insights into the advantages and disadvantages of Silicon Valley. “The main learning for me is that the startup business is often not that smooth as it is communicated”, says David. Silicon Valley startups are well-known for very good marketing, but underneath the surface, things often look different. “It is always a long journey with a lot of money involved”, says David who spoke to founders. “That is an important insight. Sometimes you have to pivot, and it is good to see that this is always an option.” The reality Silicon Valley includes a lot of show. Founders, venture capitalists, and top engineers are celebrated like pop stars. “It is much more of a show than in Europe. I was aware of that, but I did not expect that this show thing would be that important”, says David. “There must be a show involved, but in the end, the technology has to be robust. Otherwise, you won’t survive.” The Factory1 delegation in Front of Apple Park. © Factory1It’s the culture, not the technology Silicon Valley is one of the major tech hubs worldwide – which does not mean that European technology is not as good. “The quality of engineers in Silicon Valley is the same as in Europe. It would not make sense to move our development here, but it makes definitely sense to do sales here”, says David, a former postdoc at ETH Zurich. “The main reason why people here are more successful is that they have much more confidence. In Europe people are much more afraid of failing”, says David. “The engineers here are very expensive, and they are less loyal, so the change a lot and just go for the money. Vivien, who studied at TU Munich, agrees: “I think we have a better education in Germany or Austria. But here you have the networks that push talents forward.” A well-known fact is that VCs in Silicon Valley prefer to invest in founders who already have failed. They will avoid the mistakes they fell into before. “In Europe, you are successful if you don’t screw up. In Silicon Valley it’s the other way around”, says David. Vivien adds: “People raise millions on ideas. That does not happen in Germany. That makes the US a very good place for startups.” The Factory1 delegation visits the legendary HP garage. © Factory1Why not relocate? For US founders, it often seems that they can raise millions very easily. That would not work for European founders who come to the Bay Area, Vivien says: “There is a strong cultural difference, and that makes it harder for European startups to get clients, deals or to raise money in the US.” Still, her team thinks of relocating to the US in the future. “Valuations tend to be much better in the US. Our company has a lot of traction, but not a lot of revenue. Traction is valued much higher in the US, and that is a good reason why we consider relocating to Silicon Valley”, says Objectbox’s CEO. “But currently we prefer to be based in Europe.” Today, she would not want to transfer the company’s IP to the States and keeps it in Europe. “Once the IP is in the US, you can’t get it out again.” Exeon Analytics also wants to stay in Europe. “Expanding to the US is an interesting option, but it is not our main priority. We are a European company, and we use that fact that we are Swiss as part of our marketing”, says David. “It would not make sense to move development here, but it makes definitely sense to do sales overseas.”","14.

"5","https://www.trendingtopics.at/factory1-accelerator-mentors-kapsch/","Factory1","„Startups can open our eyes with disrupting ideas“: This is how the Factory1 accelerator works","Once self-driving cars take over our streets, everything will get better. Less traffic, less CO2, fewer accidents, more parking spaces. Right? Well, forecasts are hard to make, especially when they concern the not so near future. Meanwhile according to other studies the robo-cars might slow down the whole traffic and make it all less efficient. The mobility of the future and the effects of autonomous vehicles are topics that the Austrian tech company Kapsch also addresses. It is known worldwide for its toll systems, traffic infrastructure and mobility management systems. Traffic of the future is unpredictable „Some studies say that autonomous driving will provide more traffic. If self-driving cars become affordable for everyone, then they will compete with public transport“, said Christoph Seybold. “And we have to be prepared for this scenario.” At Kapsch, Christoph works as a solution consultant, but recently also as a startup mentor. This year, international startups will once again participate in the in-house Factory1 accelerator program. 193 startups have applied and four to five young companies will be invited to take part in the five-month program. „We have evaluated whether there are any solutions that we can integrate with,“ says Barbara Hollinger, Business Development Manager at Kapsch. Like Christoph, she is one of the 60 international mentors who will take care of the startups. „We are looking for startups that are already on the market and have made sales.” Individualism vs. tower manager Mobility Platforms, Integrated Urban Mobility, Data Privacy, Smart Autonomous Platforms – Factory1 is all about the mobility of the future. This new reality might seem far away, but is indeed approaching in giant leaps, and it comes with some effects that could be surprising. For example, self-driving cars themselves are considered expensive, but this image changes drastically once they are integrated into car sharing services. „There are calculations that fares will fall so sharply that they c<U+043E>uld undercut the price of the subway tickets,“ says Christoph. That would increase demand, and instead of less cars on the streets, there would suddenly be more. This is also because conventional vehicles do not disappear overnight. „This mixed traffic will cause considerable problems,“ says Barbara. “We need to be prepared for this challenge. Taking innovative ideas into account in collaboration with startups can help” Kapsch is investigating solutions from the complete vehicle individualism to a fully centralized control of every movement. „Opinions significantly vary whether self-driving vehicles will coordinate themselves or if they will be managed from a central point similar to airplanes from a tower,“ says startup mentor Christoph. „Self-driving vehicles could be directed by a traffic management center. We’re already considering what components are needed to set up such a system.“ „Startups can open our eyes“ And this is where startups come in. „We already have well-founded and patented tech solutions in-house, but keeping up with rapidly changing market demands can become a challenge for large companies“ says Barbara. „That’s where startups come in. They can open our eyes with disrupting ideas.“ The goal of Factory1: From February to June, the young companies will develop a proof of concept in the accelerator, which ideally works in conjunction with existing Kapsch solutions. At the end of the program, there should be a close collaboration. Even a complete takeover is conceivable. „Ideally, we can position ourselves jointly in the market,“ says Barbara. The perfect startup The selection process for the accelerator is demanding. „The perfect startup can dock its solution to ours and shares our vision,“ says Barbara. „Of course, with almost 200 applicants, those who can’t present their pitches properly fall out. On the other hand: a startup that throws out perfect marketing phrases but doesn’t have a profound solution as a basis won’t work either.” Founders should better think in advance what the benefits they can offer Kapsch are. „Some have really thought about concrete use cases and see where they could work with us. Someone who only wants funding but does not propose a concrete solution has a hard time with us,“ says Barbara. If founders are only looking for investment, they won’t make it into the accelerator. „If a team of 200 people makes zero revenue, or if a startup wants to raise ten million and has no CFO – then skepticism is appropriate,“ says Christoph. “We can be very fast” Even those who only want to get access to customer (Kapsch has 100 branches worldwide and generates more than one billion euros in turnover per year) should not be too optimistic soon. „Our customers are governments and cities that are often very conservative. It’s hard to get access to them as a startup. But if we as a company stand behind a startup, then a new top technology can take off,“ says Christoph. Kapsch is the lever to make a new product big. „When we see that there is something big in Factory1, we can be very fast.”","29.

This is important because on June 18, Objectbox and the founders of the other four startups – Aerostate, Exeon Analytics, Bestmile and DerQ – will present their PoCs to selected industry experts and the top management of Kapsch on Demo Day 2K19 in Vienna. The goal: The PoCs are to serve as a basis for further cooperation between the startups and the Austrian tech company. „We want to establish real relationships with the startups“, says Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1. „Kapsch is interested in helping the startups scale by jointly bringing innovative products and services to the market that complement the Kapsch portfolio.“ Integrating, integrating, integrating The four months in the Accelerator Program are hard work. While Objectbox, which specializes in edge computing, is working on storing and processing data in trains, Bestmile from Switzerland is working on integrating its Demand Responsive Transportation (DRT) solution into a Mobility as a Service platform (MaaS) of the Kapsch subsidiary Fluidtime. The Moscow-based startup Aerostate, headquartered in the USA, worked on a PoC for Spain`s capital Madrid. There, the founders will develop a system to measure air pollution with sensors and, based on this, distribute traffic in the city smarter. Meanwhile, DerQ’s founder took a trip to a small village in Lower Austria. There they test how they can warn connected cars about pedestrians at intersections using AI software and V2X communication . Meanwhile, Exeon Analytics from Switzerland is testing a possible integration of its cyber security solution at Kapsch.

Accelerator programs have been established for startups that companies collaborate with on specific topics. But it is not only external tech start-ups whose know-how can be tapped. In addition to Factory1, a startup accelerator, the Austrian tech company Kapsch has started to rely on intrapreneurship. „We believe in the power to reinvent ourselves from our own ranks and in the innovation potential of our own employees,“ says Cornelia Wolf, Head of Corporate Innovation at Kapsch TrafficCom AG since December 1st. For the first time this year, the company therefore implemented an Innovation Sprint for employees, in which three teams spent six days examining a problem and then working on a solution or a prototype. Shaping the future of the company The 16 participants, who participated in the Innovation Sprint from all levels of the company, were formed into three teams – from lawyers to technicians to senior experts, virtually all areas of the company were represented. „That’s a great range of participants we’ve managed. This was very well reflected in the creativity of the teams,“ says Wolf. „The prerequisite for participation comprises attitude and commitment. The participants all have an honest interest in shaping the future of the company. © KapschHow does an innovation sprint work in detail? „The first half of the sprint is for deep diving into the problem, the second half is for developing the solution,“ Wolf explains. Urban mobility“ was the overriding theme. In three challenges, the three teams provided solution for the following pains,which were defined according to the respective target groups: B2B (Business to Business): Companies entering the urban area in a more coordinated way so that they reach their destination punctually and predictably. B2C (Business to Consumer): Ensuring stress-free, sustainable and predictable mobility from A to B. B2G (Business to Government): Making the complexity of mobility issues understandable and tangible.

The first 3 days of the Innovation Sprint were devoted to the exact evaluation of the problem, for which potential customers were interviewed. „You really have to understand what the real challenge is and not just build on common or own assumptions,“ says Wolf. „It’s about formulating a hypothesis about a problem and testing it in the shortest possible time. Make the company’s pearls of innovation visible After the problem phase, it’s time to move on to the solution phase. Based on developed customer journeys and personas, the teams developed the first mock-ups and prototypes. On the sixth day, the final task was to prepare a pitch for the 17 internal jury members. „All three ideas developed by the teams will soon be presented to the entire Global Leadership Team,“ says Wolf. Then it will be clear how the projects will proceed and how they will fit to the company’s goals. „We are currently in the process of creating possible forms of employee participation,“ says Wolf. After all, some participants in the Innovation Sprint are already on fire and would like to devote 100 percent of their time to the topics they have worked on. One thing is already certain: an Innovation Sprint can properly motivate employees. And: „With this format you make your company’s pearls of innovation visible,“ says Wolf. „We want to carry out the next Sprint in 2020, this time at a foreign subsidiary.“ © Kapsch","19.

These PoCs are meant to be the foundation for long-term strategic partnerships between Kapsch and the startups. In a new whitepaper published today, Kapsch shares its experiences with the accelerator program and lays out a stepwise framework for designing corporate-startup collaborations based on existing research, own studies, and the Factory1 experience. The whitepaper is aimed at managers who want to know how navigate the challenges and capture the benefits of corporate-startup collaborations. Wide range of opportunities Hackathons, events, startup services, incubators, accelerators, investments, acquisitions – companies have a wide range of opportunities to work together with startups. „Rather than a horizontal accelerator that is open to a wide range of startups, we opted for a vertically-focused program in the mobility sector“, Kapsch writes. „We decided on equity-free project funding for several reasons. First, early-stage investment was not a priority for us. Second, we wanted to attract later-stage startups for which giving up equity is not an attractive proposition. Third, we wanted to leverage our accelerator to learn about the ventures and then selectively invest in the most promising ones after the program.“ Important changes The whitepaper also describes how the right people were brought into the program, how promising startups were selected and how procedures were simplified to be faster. The whitepaper is the foundation for the improvements Kapsch introduced to Factory1. The most important changes that that have been implemented in the second round of Factory1 are: The entire board (CEO, CTO, and COO) now sponsors Factory1 in order to ensure executive commitment and involvement throughout the program The search fields are closer aligned with Kapsch’s business units so as to increase the strategic fit Kapsch is aiming to establish partnerships and equity investments in the case of successful proof-of-concepts. The post-acceleration phase is clearly structured, with dedicated people responsible for pursuing collaborations beyond the program. Partnership talks are included during the program and, after the demo day, Kapsch has a pre-scheduled follow-up meeting with potential startup partners If your are interested, you can download the whitepaper here for free.","11.

The view from the terrace of the 25hours Hotel in the city center is amazing and the shining lights of Austria’s capital invite to explore the nightlife. But the founders of five international start-ups did not come to Vienna for sightseeing. They came to participate in the first acceleration week of Kapsch’s Factory1. 193 startups have applied for the corporate accelerator, five of them finally made it and are now going to enter the four-month program. Aerostate from Russia, Exeon Analytics and Bestmile from Switzerland, DerQ from United Arab Emirates and ObjectBox from Germany have defined their Proof of Concepts (PoC) with one of the largest technology companies in Austria. Within the next four months, they will have to prove that they can integrate their solutions into the Kapsch portfolio. Aus Datenschutz-Gründen ist dieser Inhalt ausgeblendet.

They need to have their own first customers and be able to finish projects with our customers”, says Simrit Sandhu, Program Lead of Factory1. 60 Kapsch mentors from 14 different countries work together with the startups – in Vienna, but also in Silicon Valley. “That is really important for our own company culture. We want to be ready to work together with young companies and new ideas”, says Simrit. “Expectation management is very important. Some corporates underestimate that they need a lot of patience and endurance. That’s why Factory1 is all about long-term goals and not about quick wins. We want to establish real relationships with the startups.” The startups have expectations too. “Kapsch has huge expertise in traffic management and forecasting. With the help of their data, we expect to be able to provide better accuracy for our air quality forecasting”, says Ruslan Zhuravlev, Head of Research of Aerostate. His company has developed an air quality management platform for smart cities. “Maybe we can offer sensor management together with Kapsch to industry customers.” © Kapsch“The company owner is pushing the accelerator” What the startups most appreciate about Kapsch are the opportunities to jointly launch a product on the market and offer it to the company’s customers worldwide. “Usually big corporates tend to move slowly. They want our product, but often they have other priorities. But at Kapsch, the company owner is pushing the startup accelerator, and that helps a lot”, says David Gugelmann, CEO and founder of Exeon Analytics from Switzerland. Gugelmann has specialized in cybersecurity solutions and looks for corporate customers. “Our algorithms can identify cyber attacks very fast. Sometimes it takes companies up to 200 days to detect a cyber attack, but we can do it within one day”, says David. “Our technology can be interesting for Kapsch BusinessCom, because they manage critical networks for customers as well as the whole Kapsch Group. Our software can be an add-on to their cyber defense center.” The technologies of the five startups are very different, but all have to do with mobility and can find their place in Kapsch’s many divisions. © Kapsch“Our mission is to eliminate road accidents”, says Georges Aoude, co-founder and CEO of DerQ from the UAE. “We take live feeds of road cameras and other sensors. Our algorithms can predict what will happen in the next few seconds on the road. For example, we can predict if a pedestrian will cross the road or if a cyclist takes a right or left turn.” By detecting pedestrians, cyclists, and cars at crossroads, DerQ wants to alarm vehicles to break in time to avoid accidents. Georges has a clear goal on how to integrate with Kapsch: “Kapsch develops roadside units that communicate with connected vehicles. We could provide the software to predict accidents. We can address use cases that are important both to their customers and our customers.” “We see ourselves in a lot of places” Bestmile from Switzerland and ObjectBox from Munich are also looking for win-win situations. “I think there is huge potential for cooperation. Kapsch has Fluidtime, a provider of MaaS solutions, and we are working on a proof of concept on how to integrate our solution with Fluitime”, says Raphael Gindrat, CEO of Bestmile. His startup works on a software platform that enables mobility companies (e.g. public transport providers in cities) to offer new services such as ride-hailing, ride pooling, micro-transit, robotaxi and autonomous shuttle services. The Kapsch subsidiary Fluidtime would be the perfect partner for Bestmile. “We empower edge computing. We allow devices to operate offline in real time, and we improve data security”, says Vivien Dollinger, CEO of Objectbox. “We work on a PoC for Kapsch’s railway system. We can help them to synchronize their data not only across their trains but also across their servers. There is the opportunity to be integrated into some of their products. We have a tool that Kapsch can use to improve efficiency and speed and reduce costs. We see ourselves in a lot of places.” © Kapsch“Be a good partner” Whether everything will work well for the selected startup will show in the next weeks and months until the final Demo Day. “The trick is to prove that the startup is a good partner. It would be ok if a PoC takes a bit longer – but in the end, it should work”, says Simrit, Program Lead of Factory1. “We expect that not everything works out in the estimated time. Basically, all five startups in the program are very promising and on track.”","15. April 2019","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kapsch_Factory_1-644x362.jpg"

Electric mobility, car sharing, autonomous vehicles, and connected cars are the four major areas in which car manufacturers, internet giants, and technology companies are competing for the future of mobility. At the end of the day, it’s all about who has primary access to the consumer. As fewer and fewer young people get driving licenses, fewer and fewer people in cities want to afford a car and more and more consumers want to get from A to B sustainably, intelligent mobility services are in demand. „A real paradigm shift“ „The entire mobility space is in a phase of major upheaval. A real paradigm shift is taking place,“ says Wolfgang Brückler, Senior Expert Mobility Solutions at Kapsch TrafficCom. „There is a massive trend towards the sharing economy, and owning a car in the city is becoming increasingly unattractive. Autonomous driving will lead to a sharp drop in mobility prices. That in general means – people’s mobility habits are changing massively.“ In order to absorb these changing habits, more and more companies are working on Mobility as a Service (MaaS). „The whole idea behind Mobility as a Service is that you no longer need your own car“, says Wolfgang. From public transport and car sharing services to rental bicycles and e-scooters – theoretically, a MaaS provider could give its users access to all these mobility services for a monthly fee – a mobility subscription that includes everything you need to get from A to B. The ultimate mobility subscription In Scandinavian countries, companies have already started to build MaaS – fueled by Austrian know-how. For example, the startup UbiGo from Sweden combines public transport, car sharing, car rental and taxis in one intermodal mobility service. Each household can choose a monthly subscription, which all family members can use. „This is one of the very few MaaS operators that is currently rolling out the service,“ says Wolfgang. UbiGo would not be possible without the partnership with Kapsch. The Kapsch subsidiary Fluidtime supplies the cloud-based service solution for UbiGo, which handles everything from planning and booking to payment. As a cloud provider, Fluidtime provides the technical platform on which MaaS providers around the world can build their apps. Customers don’t always have to be private companies – cities or regions could also use the software to launch quickly their own MaaS offerings. Fluitime, for example, is also part of a public-private innovation project in the City of Aarhus in Denmark. In Aarhus, Fluidtime is responsible for operating a MaaS platform that supports both public and private transport operators. The goal ist to support collective forms of transport in order to reduce environmental pollution and CO2 emissions. Challenges ahead In order to bring the maximum value to the customers, MaaS services combine many different mobility providers. „The MaaS idea is very young. It’s challenging to get the many mobility providers on board. Some are afraid to give up end-customer contact,“ says Wolfgang. There seems to be a little misconception. In the end, all that matters for MaaS platforms is to supply their mobility partners with more new users, not to snatch away their existing ones. In any case, consumers have the money for MaaS – the total cost of owning a car often exceeds 300 euros per month. This amount could be spent on mobility subscriptions and in this case, users no longer need to worry about refueling, garages or winter tires. Combined with electromobility, MaaS offers one more fringe benefit: more eco-friendly mobility.","28. Februar 2019","https://www.trendingtopics.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MaaS_Pexels-780x439.jpg"

Five of them finally made it and are now going to enter the four-month program of „Factory1 2K19“ and receive equity free financial resources and expert mentoring. It was a difficult decision for the jury of experts to select five winners from the top 15, all of whom developed and presented tailor-made concepts for Kapsch. The potential participants of Factory1 came from ten different countries, from Switzerland to Israel and Canada. „Innovation happens when you start thinking out of the box“, said Marcus Handl, Head of Corporate Development & Innovation and Factory1 Program Owner, at the opening of the Winner’s Ceremony at Reaktor Vienna. „Startups can simply be faster in certain areas because they do not have to pay attention to certain things and they do not have to pay any attention to processes,“ adds CEO Georg Kapsch in an interview with Trending Topics. Cooperation more important than takeover The focus this year is on startups that want to shape the future of mobility. „We are very much involved in data analysis, we are very much involved in monitoring critical situations in traffic and especially on the infrastructure side,“ says Kapsch, explaining the program’s focus. In the foreground is the cooperation with the agile startup companies and not so much a possible participation or takeover. Kapsch does not want to exclude the latter, but: „We need precisely these entrepreneurs, who founded these companies, who are enthusiastic about them. What’s in it for us when we buy them? „ 53 mentors for proof of concept 53 mentors from 14 countries and various companies of the Kapsch Group will accompany the program. In four months, the startups will lead concepts and prototypes to a proof of concept. The solutions developed jointly with the young entrepreneurs are intended to be the basis for longer-term collaborations. How startups can benefit from working with large industrial companies? „The moment it comes to the real innovation, ie the implementation of the idea, it needs a certain professionalization and customer service,“ says Georg Kapsch, who is also president of the Federation of Austrian Industries. The 5 participants of Factory1 2K19 are: Aerostate, USA Aerostate provides cities and businesses with air quality analysis and 4-day weather forecasts by city district. The analytics tools convert the raw forecast data into realizable findings for apps or IoT applications. The platform is designed to help cities make decisions that impact the city ecology. The startup has its origins in Moscow, Russia and was founded in 2015 by Dmitry Solomentsev. Bestmile, Switzerland The Swiss startup Bestmile is working on the optimization of public and private fleets consisting of autonomous and vehicles with human drivers. Their platform helps to deploy, manage, and optimize fleets with any type of vehicle for any type of service. Customers include PostBus, Switzerland’s largest bus transit company. Objectbox, Germany Objectbox has developed a database that is especially optimized for small IoT and mobile devices. The database needs less than 1 MB storage space and, according to Objectbox, is many times faster than competing products. Exeon Analytics, Switzerland Exeon Analytics uses machine learning to analyze activities in a corporate network and to identify and investigate malware infections and data breaches hiding in regular network traffic. According to the Startup this allows the customers to find the so-called needle in the haystack and transform collected log data into actionable security insights. Derq, United Arab Emirates Through the use of Artificial Intelligence and connected vehicle technology, Derq can anticipate and prevent car crashes. The startup is based in Dubai based and originally a spin-off from MIT. In 2017 Derq went through the renowned Techstars accelerator.","04.

Which will make a lot of cool things possible.","Today, many things are connected to the Internet – from flower pots to TV sets and sneakers. One very important part of our lives is surprisingly not connected yet: the cars. The communication process between vehicles and the infrastructure still primarily happens through the human drivers – they look at traffic lights, wave pedestrians across the road or nod to each other at intersections. But so-called V2X communication and the increasing automation of vehicles will change this very soon. „For us, V2X describes the vision that vehicles can communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure,“ says Oliver Brandl, VP Business Development at the Solution Center Connected Road at Kapsch TrafficCom. „While the whole world has been connected, cars have been overlooked so far. Even if today’s vehicles are very smart and have many sensors, they do not exchange information with others“. „I am here“, says the car That’s gonna change fast. Car manufacturers like Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors and Daimler have already announced that they will be launching vehicles, equipped with the necessary technology for V2X communication. „Connected vehicles will become part of everyday life long before autonomous vehicles. This technology is ready for the market,“ says Oliver. The aim is to make traffic more efficient and safer. Glossary: Who is talking to whom?V2X – Vehicle to EverythingV2I – Vehicle to InfrastructureV2P – Vehicle to PersonV2V – Vehicle to Vehicle Development of V2X has been an ongoing process for the past ten years. „Kapsch has always been involved in communication, this is the thread running through the company’s history,“ says Barbara Hollinger, Business Development Manager at Kapsch. „We can now see that more and more vehicles that can communicate with the infrastructure are coming to the road. We want to prepare our customers, i.e. road operators and cities, for this scenario“. Using the “ITS G5” standard, a Wireless LAN based technology, cars are able to send a „I am here“ message ten times per second – and receive messages from other vehicles, the road infrastructure and traffic management centers. These messages include, for example, what kind of car is where, at what speed it is driving and in which direction. Factory1: Looking for startups „Experts say that highly automated or even autonomous driving will only be possible if the vehicles are connected to each other. Today, humans communicate with each other and convert this information into driving movements. Cars must also develop these capabilities,“ says Oliver. The technical infrastructure is key for this scenario. Today, it’s already possible and in test phase (for example on the motorway near Vienna Airport) for the road itself to send information to cars – for example information about a traffic jam or speed limits. This data can be shown to the driver on a display. In the future, however, self-driving cars will also have to be able to process such data in real time – and this holds potential that exceeds the capabilities of human drivers by far. In the V2X area, Kapsch also wants to cooperate with startups. „We’re looking for innovative ideas, especially for startups on the platform side, and want to use our Factory1 accelerator to gain a new perspective on our ideas,“ says Barbara. „In the accelerator, we evaluate whether it makes sense to integrate our system with theirs or vice versa.” Beyond the line of sight When vehicles begin to communicate with other cars and the infrastructure, things beyond humans capabilities become possible. „We are stretching an invisible safety net across the road,“ says Barbara. „This digital communication between cars goes further than the sensors built into the car itself.” Looking over the next hilltop, knowing what the weather is like on the other end of the tunnel, looking around corners – that’s V2X communication. „The car already knows that a vehicle is braking in front before a human driver would see the car’s brake lights in front“, says Barbara. A particularly appealing scenario: cars will know long before they arrive at the crossroad whether it will be green or red – and then can adjust their speed accordingly and catch the famous „green wave“. There is no obligation for car manufacturers to use the technology for V2X communication. In practice, this means that consumers will buy them as a bonus feature that offers more safety and comfort. It is also possible to upgrade older vehicles with small boxes that can send and receive data. Will we still need traffic lights in the future? Once all vehicles have been connected and „talk“ to each other, this will create a completely new street scene. „Communicating vehicles could then negotiate their own way through the crossroads,“ says Oliver. „Do we still need traffic lights to regulate traffic? Does a zebra crossing always have to be in the same place, or can it move digitally with people?” Cars will be able to communicate with pedestrians or cyclists on the road. Autonomous vehicles could use special lights to project zebra crossings onto the road or external displays to indicate that they are letting a person cross the street. „Yes, it is a great challenge to involve all road users in this communication,“ says Barbara. And here Kapsch technology comes into play again: „The infrastructure can, for example, detect pedestrians and pass this information on to the cars.” After all, V2X communication is there for one main thing: more safety on our roads.","15.
